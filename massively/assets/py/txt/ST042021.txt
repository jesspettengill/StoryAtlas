Walz, DFL prioritize police reform: GOP says budget should take precedence as the end of the legislative session nears

Full text: Gov. Tim Walz insisted Thursday that new police accountability measures must be part of the mix as the Legislature works to finalize a state budget and finish its session.
"The accountability we saw last week for George Floyd is the floor -- not the ceiling -- of what we need to do in Minnesota to advance police reform," Walz said Thursday in St. Paul, where he was joined by a dozen state lawmakers who want a new round of policing bills in response to the murder of Floyd and this month's police killing of Daunte Wright. "True justice comes through real, systemic change to prevent this from happening again."
Despite renewed urgency among advocates, Republicans who control the state Senate have given little indication they'll support significant changes to state policing laws. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said the guilty verdict against former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin for murdering Floyd reduced the urgency.
"Once that happened, the pressure here went down dramatically because people thought they got a fair judgment there," Gazelka said. He pointed to changes passed by the Legislature last year, which Walz and allies say didn't go far enough.
The standoff over policing threatens to destabilize high-stakes negotiations over the state budget, with less than three weeks to go until the Legislature must adjourn its regular session. Last week, Gazelka reversed an initial pledge to hold new statehouse hearings on law enforcement legislation, and he said Thursday that passing a new budget takes precedence.
Walz and Democratic lawmakers want to see new limits on when police can stop motorists, a bill to create citizen oversight of police, changes to no-knock warrants and banning police from affiliating with white supremacist groups.
They also want to require that police turn over body camera footage to families of people killed in deadly police encounters within 48 hours, among other proposals.
The DFL-controlled House passed the new police reforms as part of its public safety spending package last week. Gazelka has since said that a conference committee to reconcile the competing House and Senate public safety proposals would be the next forum to debate police accountability.
Gazelka left open the possibility of agreement, but he said Republicans would not accept a proposal to end qualified immunity for police, nor would they support measures that were previously considered but not passed last year.
The GOP also will not agree to "changes that prevent law enforcement from intervening," Gazelka said.
House Democrats are also advancing a late proposal to establish "sign and release" warrant procedures statewide that would curb the need for police to arrest people who have misdemeanor warrants for failing to appear in court for certain charges.
The public safety conference committee's first meeting is scheduled for Monday, two weeks before the Legislature's May 17 conclusion.
"Right now we have a window of time, while the world is watching, to be the leaders that our communities of color need us to be," said Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury.
Kent pointed to this week's passage of $7.8 million to cover security expenses related to Chauvin's trial as evidence of "how fast the Senate majority can act when they choose to."
Walz said Thursday that, after an initial conversation with Gazelka and House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park -- where Gazelka's since-withdrawn plan to hold separate hearings was aired -- there have been no further "meaningful" talks on police reform across the aisle.
Walz and a group of Democrats from the House and Senate were joined by state Rep. Tim Miller, R-Prinsburg, who will participate in the public safety conference committee. Miller is a member of the New House GOP Caucus, an offshoot of the main House Republican Caucus, and said he would provide "balance" to the upcoming debate.
"Public safety is perhaps the most important role of government, and many people across the state have lost confidence in our system," Miller said.
In a statement earlier Thursday, Rep. Brian Johnson, R-Cambridge and the GOP lead in the House's public safety committee, dismissed many of the House DFL-crafted provisions as "partisan proposals that were crafted without input or support from law enforcement organizations" and Republicans.
Lobbying groups for Minnesota's police chiefs, sheriffs and rank-and-file officers also oppose the House's public safety bill. In a joint letter last week, they singled out proposals such as new body camera requirements and civilian review boards as bills that would "damage the credibility and integrity of the law enforcement investigative process and jeopardize public safety."
Lawmakers in support of the new bills argued that an initial sweeping package of policing laws -- including bans on chokeholds and warrior-style training -- that passed after Floyd's death last year were merely a first step.
State Rep. Carlos Mariani, the St. Paul Democrat who chairs the House public safety committee, described how an "early warning system" bill to flag officer misconduct was rejected by the Senate in 2019 before a similar measure passed in the months after Floyd was killed.
"The price for action was too high," Mariani said. "It mattered to George Floyd that the Senate chose not to act earlier than it could have. Let's not repeat that."

Full text: WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden's push for universal preschool and free community college is the latest transformative proposal from the new administration, this one with the potential to remake child care and education in Minnesota.
"It is putting working families and kids at the center," U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat, said of the proposals Biden rolled out Wednesday night in his first speech to a joint session of Congress. "And I think that's exactly the right thing to do."
Coming on top of the Democratic president's $1.9 trillion COVID relief package and his proposal to spend $2 trillion on an infrastructure plan, the new, $1.8 trillion American Families Plan is already facing criticism from Republicans, given the high costs and the administration's push to raise taxes on the wealthy to help pay for it.
"The President has already spent a whopping $2 trillion of money we don't have on far-left giveaways and unveiled $4 trillion in additional spending to be paid for by the hardworking taxpayer," said Republican Rep. Pete Stauber in a statement.
Biden's sweeping proposal also includes $225 billion for child care and monthly payments to parents.
Denise Specht, the president of Education Minnesota, the state's largest teachers union, said that though they're waiting on more details, "This certainly looks like a package our educators can support and work toward making a reality."
Sen. Amy Klobuchar pointed to key priorities in Biden's announcement that she shares.
"Even before this pandemic, families across the country were struggling to get by," the Minnesota Democrat said in a statement. "Exorbitant childcare, education, and healthcare costs have made providing for a family and balancing a checkbook impossible for too many."
The pandemic has hit child care providers especially hard, but Minnesota has been struggling to fund providers for much longer, said Chad Dunkley, the CEO of New Horizons Academy, the state's largest day-care provider.
Many areas of the state have no child care options and families have to choose between caring for children or staying in the workforce.
"Many families have to make very tough decisions," said Dunkley, who attended the speech virtually as Smith's guest. "I love that this plan is bigger, and it's worth it for our economy and for our country to invest in young families."
The narrow Democratic majorities in Congress mean uncertain prospects for Biden's plan and a partisan divide.
"The president painted a picture full of promise, but the reality is that under his failed leadership, we are in an America more divided than ever," Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn said in a statement after the speech.
Biden called on the divided Congress to pass police reform and urged lawmakers to reach a "consensus" by the anniversary of George Floyd's death. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd after kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes. Democrats have named their police reform bill after George Floyd, but even as it passed the House, major GOP opposition remained.
"We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans," Biden said. "Now is our opportunity to make some real progress."

Civil Rights panel relents on Chauvin statement: The Mpls. commission issued carefully worded remarks after advice from the city attorney's office.

Full text: A Minneapolis commission seeking to issue a statement about Derek Chauvin's trial finally settled on one -- after city lawyers persuaded it to avoid references to George Floyd and the court proceedings.
Last week, as the jury was deliberating, the Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission voted to issue a statement encouraging peaceful protests, exhorting city leaders and police to prioritize de-escalation, and condemning police brutality and white supremacy.
Missing was an earlier version of the introductory statement that said "the world is focused on the upcoming trial associated with the killing of George Floyd" and the trial "represents a critical moment for civil rights for Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota."
The volunteer commissioners had jockeyed for weeks over the wording in the statement -- which had prompted concerns in the city attorney's office.
Susan Trammell, an attorney for the city, had advised the commission not to issue their earlier statement, citing in part Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill's remarks that he wished city officials would stop discussing the case. She also said she believed the commission and its task forces lacked the authority to issue press statements.
During the meeting last week, Commissioner Mark Stignani rejected the idea that the body lacks authority to issue public statements. Nevertheless, he suggested they amend the statement.
"I do concur with the city attorney that we don't want to impact a trial," he said, adding later: "Let's make this about giving people freedom to file complaints and know where to put their votes, as well as their complaints."
Commissioner Ken Rance, who suggested they address the trial in the first place, asked if they could quickly release their statement if they did "sanitize" it "for lack of a better euphemism."
Ultimately, he and other commissioners agreed to make the changes.
The commission also voted to dissolve its Accountability for the Killing of George Floyd Task Force, created for the purpose of issuing statements during the trial.

Full text: The killing of George Floyd on May 25 set in motion a massive and complex investigation only now coming into fuller view after the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin.
In a crowded office at Minneapolis police headquarters, state investigators first met with Chauvin to question him soon after the fatal encounter that would touch off weeks of protests and unrest worldwide. Chauvin declined to be interviewed by authorities, but by then the high-stakes investigation was growing in scope and urgency.
Hundreds of pages of records obtained by the Star Tribune provide a behind-the-scenes look at how the probe into Floyd's death frantically unfolded as Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agents spent countless hours poring over video footage, interviewing witnesses and reviewing forensic and digital evidence.
They eventually pieced together a detailed timeline of the incident, starting from when Floyd walked into Cup Foods on the warm May evening to his takedown and arrest by police for allegedly passing a fake $20 bill. Their counterparts at the FBI were doing the same as news and harrowing bystander footage of Floyd's death stirred outrage around the globe.
The world's eyes were on Minneapolis again Tuesday when a jury found Chauvin guilty of all three counts of murder and manslaughter after deliberating for less than 10 hours. He is expected to be sentenced later this year.
But, as the first protesters took to the streets the day after Floyd's death last year, investigators from the BCA were already working against the clock to get to the bottom of what happened -- and why.
By then many people had seen the cellphone footage of Floyd's arrest, showing him pleading to breathe as officers Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane pinned him to the pavement -- while a fourth officer, Tou Thao, stood guard -- until he fell unconscious and died. All four were later fired and charged in Floyd's death.
BCA spokesperson Jill Oliveira declined to answer questions about the investigation, saying Chauvin's case remains active until appeals have been exhausted. A Minneapolis police spokesman declined to comment.
On the BCA's end, the investigation was run by senior special agent James Reyerson and the members of the agency's recently formed Force Investigations Unit, who like Reyerson brought years of experience investigating police shooting and in-custody deaths.
Reyerson got a call on the day Floyd died telling him to report to Room 108 at police headquarters downtown -- an office that used to house most of the department's detective units, including homicide, robbery and assault. Minneapolis Police Department Chief Medaria Arradondo and most of his command staff had arrived, as had former police union president Lt. Bob Kroll. Chauvin was also there, coming from HCMC, where he had gone after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance.
Officers declined interviews
After conferring with his boss, Reyerson and another agency official met with Chauvin, Kueng and Lane to photograph the officers and collect their uniforms, guns and equipment. But the three officers declined to speak to investigators or give blood samples, on the advice of their union representatives. Meanwhile, another senior agency official went out to 38th and Chicago to oversee the collection of evidence at the scene, which hadn't yet been flooded with angry protesters demanding that the officers be fired.
The day after Floyd died, Reyerson went back to work. A former New York City cop and Drug Enforcement Administration agent, he had investigated other high-profile police killings in the city -- names like Thurman Blevins, Travis Jordan and Justine Ruszczyk Damond that were instantly recognizable to social justice activists. But nothing compared to the Floyd case.
As the case wore on, massive demonstrations broke out in Minneapolis and beyond, with some elected officials and activists calling for fundamental changes in policing -- only adding to the pressure on investigators. The BCA was also still wounded from criticism during the case of Mohamed Noor, when prosecutors openly accused the agency of mishandling certain elements of the investigation into the former officer's fatal shooting of Damond, an unarmed Australian woman who had called 911 to report a possible assault. During the trial, prosecutors argued that investigators failed to follow up with certain witnesses.
On May 29, the day after some protesters torched the Third Precinct police station, Reyerson was present when Chauvin was arrested at the office of his then-attorney and taken to BCA headquarters, where Chauvin again declined to be interviewed.
The weeks that followed were a whirlwind of interviews with eyewitnesses, Police Department officers of all ranks, medical experts and anonymous tipsters. Almost from the beginning, the BCA was flooded with scores of tips and leads, every one of which had to be painstakingly chased down.
A caller in Mexico claimed to be Floyd's mother, who had been dead for two years. A jailhouse informant contacted authorities to say that he had sold Floyd cocaine and methamphetamine. Someone else claimed to have a photo of one of the officers involved wearing a "White Lives Matter" hat. A woman said she remembered being pulled over by Chauvin in the 1990s and subjected to racist treatment, but when investigators ran her license through a database, they discovered that Chauvin hadn't yet joined the MPD at the time the stop was said to have happened.
Building a portrait
Without being able to question Chauvin, investigators worked to pull together a portrait of the fired officer through interviews with his former colleagues and even relatives of people killed in other police encounters in which Chauvin was involved, including speaking with the sister of Wayne Reyes, who was fatally shot in 2006 after a chase that ended when he pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers.
Investigators reviewed Chauvin's personnel file, which summarized his employment history, psychological evaluations, and training and disciplinary records. They also scrutinized Chauvin's record as a training officer to rookie cops; internal MPD records obtained by investigators showed that Kueng shadowed Chauvin on 17 shifts in March 2020.
Investigators even consulted trainers from the department's academy to learn more about acceptable police procedures and twice spoke with a use-of-force expert who teaches strangulation to find out whether any of the involved officers had taken the class. They hadn't.
Both Lane and Thao were interviewed by the agency. On June 2, Thao sat down with BCA agents Reyerson and Brent Petersen and FBI agent Blake Hostetter, speaking frequently about the officers' safety, only addressing Floyd's well-being and bystanders' concerns after being prompted by one of the agents. In an unprecedented move, prosecutors last August released a video of the interview.
During his interview with authorities, Lane said that while Chauvin was not his training officer, the veteran "was someone that I'd talked to for advice on calls."
Reviewing every angle
As they tried to recreate the incident, BCA agents reviewed video from every angle of the encounter, from officers' body cameras and the city surveillance camera mounted across the street from where the arrest took place to the viral Facebook Live video recorded by 17-year-old Darnella Frazier. Frazier had been on her way to Cup Foods with her cousin when she stopped to record Floyd's arrest. The footage was a key factor in the Chauvin trial, where it was played repeatedly for jurors and slowed down frame by frame.
BCA agents continued to investigate all possibilities, even though in the minds of many the video showed irrefutable evidence that Floyd suffocated under Chauvin's knee.
Using video and other sources, investigators identified at least 15 witnesses who saw what happened -- including a 6-year-old boy, whose mother didn't want him to be interviewed -- and another 20 people who claimed to have ridden past the scene.
Because of the weight of the video evidence, it didn't take long for prosecutors to charge Chauvin, four days after the incident. However, investigators continued to gather evidence for months leading up to Chauvin's trial.
On April 7, Reyerson took the witness stand and testified about the scope of the investigation, which involved 50 BCA agents, 25 FBI agents, 200 witnesses interviewed and 450 reports. Watching segments of the video in court, Reyerson walked the jury through when Chauvin's knee went on the back of Floyd's neck to when he fell silent and stopped moving.
Thirteen days later, the guilty verdicts were read, and Chauvin was led away in handcuffs.

Full text: Racial justice, affordable housing and community building dominated the discussion in an online forum Saturday with six candidates for Minneapolis mayor.
Agreeing that the city is facing a pivotal moment in the wake of George Floyd's murder, candidates challenging incumbent Jacob Frey argued that city leaders are not doing enough to make progress on those goals.
"We need leadership to help us turn this historic moment into a real turning point to a more just future," said challenger Kate Knuth.
"It just doesn't seem like people are getting it that there's a whole new paradigm in play here," said candidate Phil Sturm.
Frey said the city and state "have been resting on good intentions and pretty words for far too long. â€¦ Black residents are eyeing this moment with well-earned skepticism."
Other participants in the forum, hosted by the Minneapolis DFL Party and livestreamed on YouTube, were A.J. Awed, Sheila Nezhad and Jerrell Perry. They answered questions submitted by community groups on issues including rent control, crime, the arts and whether to reopen the intersection at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, known as George Floyd Square.
They emphasized the need to seek the involvement of community members, particularly people of color.
"I want elected officials to make it easier for everyday people to get involved in the decisions that affect our lives," Nezhad said.
"To rebuild trust in this community, they need to be at the table," Awed said of residents and police. "We have an opportunity â€¦ to really talk about this issue in a way that's transformative."
Perry agreed that residents' ideas are essential in enacting changes to policing, which he said should include eliminating traffic stops for offenses that don't threaten public safety and not touching people unless they're under arrest. "City leadership has been blessed with an opportunity over and over and over to provide accountability," he said. "They have not."
Candidates spoke in favor of redeveloping the Upper Harbor Terminal, a 48-acre site on the Mississippi River in north Minneapolis. They agreed on the importance of supporting local artists -- particularly artists of color -- and on the need to push utility companies to provide affordable energy and do their part to slow climate change.
Opinions differed on whether George Floyd Square should be reopened to traffic. Sturm favors blocking off streets "to keep [the intersection] sacred and keep people from driving over it," he said. "The city and the police probably don't want a monument to their greatest failure, which is probably why they don't want to see anything happen but going back to normal. But there is no more normal."
Frey said he favors a "phased reopening" of the square -- including a George Floyd memorial -- because he has heard from residents and business owners who want it reopened.
"This is the reality of the conversations that you have when you need to face all of the people you represent when not all of them agree," he said. "There are times when people have legitimate and competing interests and you've got to take a position."
In his closing statement, Perry struck a positive note, comparing the problems facing Minneapolis with the challenges of the global pandemic.
"We figured out how to defeat something we cannot see in less than a year," he said. "And yet we are grappling with what to do with public safety. Humans are so resilient, we're so creative â€¦ we can figure this out."

HARD CHOICES AHEAD ON POLICING: FOR BROOKLYN CENTER, SUIT COULD BE CRUSHING

Author: Prather, Shannon

Full text: It's the excruciating calculus that inevitably follows a fatal police shooting.
Families file federal civil rights lawsuits, and local governments must either negotiate with grieving loved ones to compensate them for a life lost or allow a jury to decide damages.
Minneapolis set records with the $20 million settlement paid to Justine Ruszczyk Damond's family in 2019 and the $27 million settlement paid to George Floyd's next of kin in March, hailed as the largest pretrial settlement in a civil rights wrongful-death lawsuit in U.S. history.
The big payouts made by Minneapolis and other large cities are raising the stakes for smaller cities like Brooklyn Center, where a police officer shot and killed a Black man, Daunte Wright, earlier this month. Smaller communities may struggle to pay settlements in the tens of millions, and have to resort to tax increases, borrowing, and in the most extreme circumstances, face financial insolvency.
"It leads to the really uncomfortable situation where it looks to an outsider as though your life is worth more or less depending on whether you were killed by the police in a big city versus a small town," said University of Chicago Law Prof. John Rappaport, who researches police misconduct and liability. "People think, 'Well, if George Floyd's family got $27 million, Daunte Wright's family should get $27 million because he is just as worthy.' "
Minneapolis is self-insured, relying on its relatively deep coffers to cover settlement costs. The vast majority of Minnesota cities, including Brooklyn Center, rely on an insurance trust that limits basic coverage for most incidents at $2 million.
But at a time when footage of police killings is commonplace and calls for accountability and reform are reaching a fever pitch, insurance limits and lack of funds are not a defense that will shelter Brooklyn Center -- or any city -- from multimillion-dollar judgments, legal scholars say.
Because payouts are typically both "compensation" for a life lost and "punishment" designed to motivate cities to reform policing, amounts could continue to rise, said University of Minnesota Law Prof. David Schultz.
"I am convinced [at some point] you are going to get a jury that comes back with $100 million punitive," he said. "You are going to get some jury who will say, '$27 million here, $10 million there -- it's not working,' and they are going to nail the city."
Former Brooklyn Center police officer Kimberly Potter shot and killed 20-year-old Wright during a traffic stop on April 11. Police said Potter, who is white, unintentionally fired her handgun after mistaking it for her Taser. She has resigned from the department and is charged with second-degree manslaughter.
Payouts are limited
A 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision first opened the door for local governments to be sued for damages under federal civil rights claims, Schultz said. In 1980, Minnesota cities formed the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust "in the face of a hard commercial insurance market that made it difficult and expensive for cities to find traditional insurance," trust administrator Dan Greensweig said in an e-mail.
The trust provides liability coverage for 827 of the 853 cities in Minnesota. Cities pay into the trust each year, and about one-third buy extra liability coverage capped at $5 million annually. Brooklyn Center has only purchased additional coverage for its municipal liquor store operations, Greensweig said.
The Brooklyn Center Police Department had eight police misconduct payouts from 2007 to 2018, two of which were among the most expensive police payouts in the state during that time, according to a Star Tribune analysis including data from the insurance trust.
Greensweig said the trust has never paid out on a claim above its limits, but some cities have settled cases for amounts higher than their coverage, pulling funds from their own reserves.
According to insurance trust payout data from 2007-17, the largest payouts during that time were around $3 million.
In 2017, the insurance trust, on behalf of member city St. Anthony, paid nearly $3 million to the family of Philando Castile, a Black man shot and killed by police during a traffic stop in nearby Falcon Heights. The officer who shot him was charged with felony manslaughter and reckless discharge of a firearm and acquitted on all counts.
Despite recent high-profile settlements, the trust has not adjusted coverage limits since 2014.
"With the excess coverage we make available for cities that desire it, we are comfortable we're currently striking an appropriate balance between providing adequate coverage for claims at a cost that does not place an undue burden on local taxpayers," Greensweig said. "We will continue to monitor that, however."
Who pays?
For smaller cities, one huge payout for police conduct could equal a year of taxes.
Brooklyn Center's 2021 property tax levy -- the amount of money the city collects in property taxes -- is about $20 million.
The suburb of 31,000 just north of Minneapolis is one of the poorest in Hennepin County with 15% of people living below the federal poverty level, according to census data. Most residents identify as people of color. Brooklyn Center is already spending about 40% -- nearly $9.8 million -- of its $23.8 million general fund this year on day-to-day police salaries and operations, according to its most recent truth-in-taxation hearing.
City leaders did not return a request for comment, but Mayor Mike Elliott attended Wright's funeral and has expressed strong support for the family and police reform.
Attorneys for the Wright family also did not respond to a request for comment.
A community's ability to pay and its insurance limits can be fodder in negotiations with a victim's family, but it doesn't preclude them from demanding more.
A huge settlement may be viewed as partial justice for the grieving Wright family. But it could also create an uncomfortable situation in which one of the state's most diverse communities, where some residents feel at odds with their own Police Department, is paying additional taxes to cover the cost of police misconduct.
"Given the demographics of the city, it's a lot of people who look like Daunte Wright who are going to wind up paying," Schultz said.
Rebuilding trust
Despite the financial pressure, large settlements can be a means for cities to publicly acknowledge the harm done and rebuild community trust, said attorney Rick Petry, program manager for diversity, equity and inclusion at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.
Cities "have to look at exposure, but we also need to look at this politically to try to figure out something we can do to restore some sort of faith in the community," he said.
In Minneapolis, the settlement in Damond's killing shattered the previous payout record -- and then was surpassed by the Floyd settlement, which forced the city to dip into its reserves. Officers were convicted in both cases.
Going forward, Petry said, city leaders will face intense scrutiny if they try to pay out lower amounts. The trend has raised the suggestion that individual officers should indemnify themselves -- though the costs could be prohibitive for officers, Schultz said.
"Also," he said, "I can't imagine any insurance company would touch it."

Floyd's Houston friend seeks solace in visit north

Full text: Tiffany Cofield knelt on Chicago Avenue, surrounded by flowers, hoping to feel her lost friend's spirit.
Nearly a year had passed since she last heard George Floyd's voice over the phone from a thousand miles away, as he made a new life in Minneapolis and she sat back in his old one in Houston.
At last, Cofield had found the resolve to visit the city that took his life under the knee of policeman Derek Chauvin. She just wanted to make peace, finally, with her friend's death.
As a cold wind blew, Cofield bowed her head and told Floyd she loved him. Then she waited.
She had not expected to make the journey.
Sometimes, she told herself that he wasn't really dead, just busy in Minneapolis.
"If I keep telling myself he's just in Minnesota and I go to Minnesota and he's not here, then what?" Cofield asked. "He's really gone."
The times that she could acknowledge what happened to Floyd, Cofield resented Minneapolis as the place that killed him. After all, she reasoned, he had lived just fine in Houston for most of his 46 years. How could he have moved to this city at age 43 and died three years later?
So she watched most of Chauvin's murder trial from her home in Texas. Cofield still needed to learn what transpired, even if she refused to watch the video of Floyd pinned to the ground. She muted the TV when those scenes played, knowing that listening would be harder than seeing; she could not bear hearing her strong friend cry out in fear.
They met in 2008 during a Thanksgiving food giveaway.
Cofield, 36, and her group of volunteers showed up at Cuney Homes, Houston's oldest public housing project, where Floyd grew up and still lived near in the city's Third Ward. "God bless y'all," she remembers Floyd saying. "Thank you for doing what you're doing in the community. How can I help?" He showed them around "The Bricks," as the complex was known.
Floyd left the neighborhood the following year to serve a prison sentence for aggravated robbery, but they reconnected in 2015 when Cofield was teaching at a charter school that served children in Cuney Homes. Floyd would mentor some of her students and counsel Cofield on how to quell violent feuds. Cofield also grew close to Floyd's mother and some other relatives, and recalled seeing Floyd daily in the years before his move to Minneapolis.
They went on tour with Houston rapper Cal Wayne, for whom Floyd worked as a security guard, and took road trips to visit relatives across the South. Over time, Floyd became like family.
In February 2017, Floyd decided to follow the path of several neighborhood friends who had sought addiction treatment, job training and a new start in Minneapolis. It was still dark when Cofield drove him to the Greyhound bus station in downtown Houston one morning.
She cried as they hugged goodbye. Floyd told her he was doing this to be a better father to his young daughter, Gianna.
"It's going to be all right," Floyd said. "I'll be back."
He returned just once, for his mother's funeral in 2018. Over the years, Floyd invited Cofield to visit several times.
"Nah, it's cold," Cofield would decline.
She still feels guilty about that.
â€¢ â€¢ â€¢
As the trial drew global attention, Cofield visited the Third Ward sometimes because she liked to look at the murals there honoring Floyd.
On one of those drives, a policeman pulled her over for not using her turn signal. Cofield, who is Black, showed her hands, then carefully explained she was reaching for her ID. She told him that Floyd had been a close friend.
"I am terrified," she told the officer.
Days later, Cofield faced another fear: She boarded a plane to Minneapolis on Sunday. As it landed, she felt a sense of duty. But it was hard to see the Minneapolis that Floyd had described with so much admiration in his phone calls. Cofield saw a slew of boarded buildings near her hotel downtown, a half-mile east of the bus station where Floyd had arrived in 2017. National Guard soldiers stood everywhere.
On Monday, she sat in the overflow room at the courthouse to watch the trial's closing arguments. She accidentally heard part of the video of Floyd pleading on the ground and briefly walked out, racked with anxiety. But Cofield liked when prosecutor Jerry Blackwell noted that while the defense had argued that Floyd died of an enlarged heart, "the reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin's heart was too small."
As the jury went into its second day of deliberations Tuesday, Cofield talked about her nervous anticipation over a late breakfast.
She was worried. She was hopeful. She thought it might be a good sign that the jury had not come back too fast -- she'd rather they take their time. Cofield was on her way to George Floyd Square when she heard the jury had a decision.
"Did you know the verdict is in?" she said, calling one of Floyd's relatives. "I'm on my way back. Do we need to dress up?"
As she approached the hotel where family members gathered for the decision, Cofield said, "Oh, my God. My stomach is literally in butterflies. â€¦ My legs are tingling."
Military vehicles rolled by. She talked on the phone with some of Floyd's family in Houston.
"Did you see the verdict is out?" Cofield told them. "The whole damn National Guard just drove by!"
She went to the ballroom where loved ones waited. Cofield braced herself. Second-degree murder: guilty. She braced herself again. Third-degree murder: guilty. Manslaughter: guilty.
She cried.
The following afternoon, Cofield decided it was time to see where Floyd spent his final hour.
â€¢ â€¢ â€¢
"I almost feel like he was chosen," she said as she walked up to the memorial.
Cofield knelt where Floyd lay trapped under Chauvin's knee last May. Where he cried out over and over that he could not breathe.
Floyd used to give the best hugs, full of love, and Cofield felt as if he was embracing her now. "It's OK," she could hear him say. "You don't have to cry anymore."
She felt a wave of peace. Comfort. After a few minutes, she rose. Looking around at the memorial, she felt heartened that at least Floyd would not be forgotten.
Cofield walked into Cup Foods, where the confrontation that led to Floyd's death began when a clerk called 911 to report that Floyd had passed a fake $20 bill to buy a pack of cigarettes. She wanted to stand where he had stood.
But as she looked around, Cofield took offense at a picture of Floyd on the wall and told a reporter that the store's actions had gotten Floyd killed. An employee who overheard her said to leave if she was going to be negative.
They briefly argued. Cofield walked out.
She went to the area around the Third Precinct police station that rioters set ablaze days after a video of Floyd's death shocked the world. She was moved by the words posted at the site where the Gandhi Mahal restaurant once stood.
Cofield began to read them out loud: "We are deeply connected/We value people over property/Let my building burn/Justice needs to be served//Black lives should matter." She reflected on their meaning. " 'Let my building burn,' that's so profound."
The fight was not over. She had already talked to Floyd family attorney Ben Crump about a protest next month in Baytown, Texas, where she lives and he is representing the family of Pamela Turner, a Black woman killed by police. On Thursday, she went to the funeral of another Black man killed by law enforcement, Daunte Wright. She had already told his mother, "People say things get easier with time; it hasn't gotten easier for me."
Cofield had even held off getting a tattoo honoring Floyd's memory, because it would mean that he was really gone. As she prepared to leave Minneapolis on Saturday, she felt ready for the tattoo. She could accept, at last, that he would never be back.

Full text: He sees George Floyd everywhere he goes.
Nearly a year after watching him die, Donald Williams is still reckoning with his role as a bystander in the most famous case of American police brutality in modern times.
"I look to my left, I see George Floyd," he said. "I look to my right, I see George Floyd. I look somewhere else and it's like I'm always remembering."
He sees Floyd's pictures on buildings. He sees Floyd's pictures on yard signs. He sees stories of his killing all over the news. "I'm always going to have a remembrance of it."
Williams' testimony helped convict former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. The trauma of what the witness saw one evening on May 25, 2020, has yet to recede.
He said he stopped at Cup Foods in south Minneapolis for a drink after going fishing with his son when he noticed several police cars outside. Williams saw an anguished Floyd trapped under Chauvin's knee and joined a group of horrified onlookers.
A professional mixed martial arts fighter, Williams urged officers to check the suspect's pulse, told Chauvin he was killing Floyd and repeatedly called him a bum as he desperately tried to make him relent. Finally Williams dialed 911 and said he had witnessed the police kill a man who was in handcuffs.
On the stand last month, Chauvin's attorney Eric Nelson sought to portray Williams as angry and threatening -- playing into what critics saw as the racist trope of the "angry Black man" -- and recited the expletive-laden insults he lobbed at the officer. Williams at first testified that he got angrier at the scene, but resisted Nelson's repeated attempts to depict him that way during further questioning.
"You grew angry, right?" Nelson asked.
"Uh, I grew controlled and [professional]."
Later, Nelson said, "Those [insults to Chauvin] grew more and more angry. Would you agree with that?"
"They grew more and more pleading for life."
Soon thereafter, Nelson asked, "It's fair to say you grew angrier and angrier?"
"No, I grew professional and professional," Williams said. "I stayed in my body. You can't paint me out to be angry."
He told the Star Tribune that the defense's tactic was "disgusting." Williams was also prepared for it. He had been labeled that way his whole life: as an angry Black child, angry Black teen, angry Black man, and angry Black father.
"And I was now being painted as an angry Black witness," said Williams. "It's like, go ahead, keep on adding to it."
He said he came to tell the truth and felt attacked on the stand.
"I've been in a battle my whole life as a Black man ... He was not going to break me," said Williams. "I'm unbreakable."
Williams said he learned to be adaptable and not let people silence him, adding, "I'm a man of adjustment, and that's why I was able to adjust under fire with him saying that to me."
Several witnesses testified about their guilt over Floyd dying in the encounter. But Williams said he believes he did what he could have done at the scene.
"I won't guilt myself for Chauvin's murderous actions," said Williams. "I won't allow it."
Still, the pain of Floyd's killing has not left him.
"It's traumatizing," Williams said. "It's traumatizing and I'm dealing with it. The whole situation of it is traumatizing. ... I deal with it on a daily basis."
As the jury came back with the verdict, Williams and his young son and daughter waited together.
Well before Floyd's death, he had talked to them about police brutality and the threats they faced, passing on the same lessons that his parents did to him. So the killing Williams witnessed wasn't so much a new learning opportunity for his children as it was an example of what he had been trying to warn them about all along.
"All this did is put light on the things I have been telling my son about being a Black male and dealing with the police and my daughter about being a Black girl and dealing with the police," said Williams.
Alongside his children, Williams prayed that jurors would see "the light and the real truth" of the killing. That they would trust the footage, not the arguments of the defense.
As a guilty verdict was read, "it was a little bit emotional for my kids and it was emotional for myself," Williams said. "And it was a lot of relief, also."
He wanted Chauvin to face the same sentence he believes a Black person would receive if they killed someone: the maximum. Officers shouldn't continue to kill unarmed people in America, Williams said, and change starts in Minnesota.
"There should be no sympathy on him or any of the other officers involved," he said.
Flanked by Floyd's relatives, attorney Ben Crump called Williams up to the lectern at a news conference following the verdict. The two men raised their clasped hands in victory.
"We love you, Donald," said Crump.
Williams told the Star Tribune that Floyd's family members and the team around him were "rock stars." He recalled that they hugged and thanked him for speaking up, and "it was an emotional situation ... I just embraced it and it was good for me to receive that."
He is still dealing with the global spotlight. Williams was driving several days ago when a stranger rolled up and said he recognized him.
"I just want to thank you," he told Williams.

Full text: Mourners filled a north Minneapolis church Thursday to honor the life of 20-year-old Daunte Wright and demand justice for an ever-growing list of Black people who have lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement.
Hundreds of people, including the state's top political leaders and the relatives and partners of George Floyd, Philando Castile, Jamar Clark, Breonna Taylor, Oscar Grant and Emmett Till, attended the funeral service for Wright, a Black man who was shot by a Brooklyn Center police officer during a traffic stop. Throughout the two-hour service, prayer, music and memories echoed alongside calls for police reform in Minnesota and at the federal level, including the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
National civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton delivered the eulogy, noting that some compared Wright's funeral procession to that of Prince.
"You thought he was just some kid with an air freshener," Sharpton said, referencing the reason Wright believed police pulled him over moments before his death. "He was a prince. All of Minneapolis has stopped today to honor the prince of Brooklyn Center."
Wright's funeral came two days after people poured into the streets of Minneapolis in elation following the murder conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in Floyd's death -- the first time in Minnesota history that a white officer has been convicted in the murder of a Black person. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office prosecuted the case, attended the service and received repeated thanks from speakers and applause from mourners.
"As we make the pleas for justice in the court of public opinion, we pray Attorney General Keith Ellison will allow us to get full justice in the court of law," said attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Wright family.
Also in attendance were Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott.
Wright was shot and killed by former Brooklyn Center police officer Kimberly Potter during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center on April 11, sparking days of protests, civil unrest and dozens of arrests in the suburb of 31,000.
Potter, who is white, is a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department. She faces one charge of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Wright. She has resigned from the department.
Wright's family said he had left the house with his girlfriend, heading to a car wash. Wright phoned his mother moments before the deadly encounter, telling her he believed police were stopping him for having an air freshener hanging next to the windshield. Police later said he was stopped for expired tabs.
The city's police chief, who has since resigned, said it appeared from body camera video that Potter used her handgun when she meant to use her Taser.
On Thursday, large photos of a smiling Wright flanked his white coffin, which was covered in dozens of red roses.
A choir and band performed gospel music, and professional jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold performed "Amazing Grace" and "We Shall Overcome" as painter Ange Hillz completed a portrait of Wright.
Dressed up in all white and in the arms of a relative, 1-year-old Daunte Wright Jr. looked wide-eyed at the crowd gathered to honor his father. Wright's parents and siblings spoke briefly, describing their son and brother's "million-dollar" smile and joyful personality.
"I was so proud of the man that he was becoming," said brother Dallas. "And he was going to make an amazing father to Junior."
Mother Katie Wright, her husband Arbuey at her side, said she'd been awake until the early hours of the morning, "so nervous and scared about what I was going to stand up here and say."
"I never imagined I'd be standing here," she said. "The roles should be completely reversed. My son should be burying me."
Walz, who spoke briefly at the service, issued a proclamation Thursday morning calling for a statewide moment of silence during the first two minutes of Wright's funeral, from noon to 12:02 p.m.
"While nothing can bring Daunte Wright back to his loved ones, we must continue to work to enact real, meaningful change at the local, state, and national levels to fight systemic racism so that every person in Minnesota -- Black, Indigenous, Brown, or White -- can be safe and thrive," the proclamation said.
Walz presented the proclamation to Wright's family, and Omar, who also spoke, presented them with a flag that had flown over the U.S. Capitol.
Klobuchar, in the last remarks before mourners filed out, delivered an impassioned call for federal police reform. She described Wright as an outgoing young man who was "lovingly voted class clown" his freshman year of high school and a basketball fan "whose left-handed shot would make any coach proud."
"Racism in this country is not isolated. It is systemic," Klobuchar said. "And so when we ask ourselves why Daunte Jr. has to grow up without a dad, when we think about what could possibly fill this hole Daunte left in the world, we come up empty. Instead, we find a much bigger hole where justice should be."
After the service, members of Floyd's family said they plan to support the Wright family as they begin a journey through grief and the legal system that they now know well.
"To be there for them, that's our main focus now," said Angela Harrelson, Floyd's aunt.
Selwyn Jones, Floyd's uncle, said he was moved by the funeral service. The Black Lives Matter movement has made gains in the past year to slow police killings of Black people, he said, but he doesn't believe the job will ever be done.
"They'll never stop," he said. "This has been happening for a long time. It will never stop."

Alternate was sure Chauvin guilty: She says the jury took its job seriously in long trial of ex-cop who killed Floyd.

Full text: The jurors who held the fate of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in their hands took their job so seriously that to protect the process they didn't learn one another's names, jobs, family ties or personal interests.
They came from various backgrounds and spanned five decades in age but somehow came to an unspoken understanding early in their three weeks together that they would limit conversation to the weather, a shortage of Cheetos at their snack table and their pizza orders every Wednesday, said Lisa Christensen, who served as an alternate juror in the case.
"We didn't want to do or say anything to jeopardize this process â€¦ so we were very careful. We were responsible. We took it seriously," said Christensen. "I felt everybody was coming from a good place, a good heart. I felt everyone was genuine. I don't think there were any ulterior motives at all."
Christensen first recounted her impressions to CBS News and said she is sharing her experience because it's an untold part of the story that adds transparency to the jury process.
Christensen said she was "sad and disappointed" when she was excused Monday afternoon before deliberations began but agreed with the verdicts the jury reached Tuesday after about nine hours and 45 minutes of deliberations -- guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25 killing of George Floyd.
"I felt [Chauvin] was guilty," she said, adding that a bystander's video of the incident and prosecution witnesses overpowered the defense's inability to deliver on claims that Floyd died of heart issues and a drug overdose.
The 56-year-old Brooklyn Center resident hadn't closely followed news of Floyd's murder last year in south Minneapolis. She had seen short clips of the bystander video a few times on the local news.
She was summoned for jury duty late last year and in December received a thick, 16-page juror questionnaire in the mail. Christensen flipped the first page open and saw the names of the four officers who arrested Floyd and who were charged in his death -- Derek Michael Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Kiernan Lane, J. Alexander Kueng.
"You got to be kidding me," she said she thought to herself. "This can't be happening."
She put the packet down on her dresser and walked away. The gravity of the situation was too much. Two weeks passed before she could look at it again. It took another week of fits and starts for her to complete the questionnaire.
By the time jury selection began three months later on March 8, Christensen was confident her number -- juror 96 of 326 empaneled for the trial -- wouldn't come up. The court needed only 14 jurors, she thought.
But as the second week of jury selection came to a close, Christensen was called to the witness stand and pressed by attorneys for an hour on her thoughts on the case, Black Lives Matter and racial bias in the criminal justice system, among other topics.
"I feel like [Chauvin] took a different role in the situation versus the other officers," she told the court during jury selection. "More like the leader."
Ultimately, a jury of nine women and five men were seated; six were people of color and eight were white.
Christensen said the worldwide attention focused on the case initially made her concerned about her role and possible backlash. But, she added, she didn't believe she or her fellow jurors would have been influenced by such issues in their deliberations.
"I know you can't please everybody," Christensen said. "We just wanted to get it right; that was the priority. That was the focus and that was the agenda."
The jurors' safety was of such concern that per a judge's order, they secretly met with Hennepin County sheriff's deputies at different locations and were driven to the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis, where 10 to 15 armed National Guard members greeted them at a fenced-off entrance to an underground parking garage.
They heard from 44 witnesses over 14 days of testimony that began March 29. Early testimony from several witnesses who saw Floyd die and pleaded with the officers to relent -- including a child, three teenage girls and one teenage boy -- was especially hard, Christensen said.
Christensen still can't shake the testimony of Darnella Frazier, who was 17 when she recorded the video of Floyd's arrest that became key to the prosecution's case, and Frazier's then 9-year-old cousin, Judeah Reynolds.
"To this day it's still in my mind that [Frazier is] â€¦ apologizing to Mr. Floyd at night because she can't go to sleep," Christensen said. "It's pretty heartbreaking. The 9-year-old, I could feel her sadness."
There were several moments during such testimony where jurors retired to a locked room guarded by a deputy and, overcome by emotion, cast their eyes downward to avoid eye contact and waited in complete silence until their return to the courtroom.
"While we were in there it was just us, you know?" Christensen said. "I feel like even though we didn't talk about it, I felt like we were supported by one another, gained strength. â€¦ It was a good group."
Frazier's video was integral to the state's case, she said, adding that the testimony of prosecution witness Dr. Martin Tobin was crucial to establishing that Floyd died of asphyxia while Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds.
"It never got any easier no matter how many times we saw it," she said of the video. "I still felt the pain I thought Mr. Floyd was going through. I never understood it any better from the first time I saw it to the last time I saw it."
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, was unable to raise doubts about the state's case or show that Floyd died of a cardiac arrest affected by drug use, or that Chauvin's actions were reasonable, Christensen said.
The trial consumed Christensen's life. After listening to testimony all day and taking notes on a legal pad that remained in the courthouse, she returned home to rewrite notes by hand about each day's witness. Under an entry for 19-year-old Christopher Martin, the Cup Foods cashier who reported Floyd's use of an alleged fake $20 bill that led to the police being called, Christensen, who used to work in retail management, wrote: "I could feel his guilt. â€¦ And it's heartbreaking knowing this young kid feels responsible."
A week before she was excused from the trial, a police officer in her city fatally shot 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop after firing a gun when she apparently meant to use her Taser. Christensen watched as smoke from police flash-bang grenades rose into the air about a mile from her home. She listened as hundreds of protesters chanted in the distance.
She was running errands Tuesday afternoon when she heard the jury had reached a verdict. She rushed home to watch the announcement on TV.
"I was like, 'Wow, they really found him guilty on all three charges,' " she said. "I was kind of shocked. I trusted them. I know they worked really well together to come to that conclusion. I knew they had what it took to get the job done."
Christensen, who is white, never imagined herself here -- thinking more critically about police reform and racial discrimination in the United States. For the first time, she had difficult but revelatory conversations about race with her roommate, a Black man she has known since she was 18.
Sometime in the next few days, she vowed, she will make her way for the first time to 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where George Floyd begged for his life, and pay her respects. And in her mind she quietly hopes he's proud of the 14 strangers who gathered in a nearly deserted building locked behind concrete barricades and barbed wire to hear his story and reach a historic decision that reverberated around the world.

Seizing the momentum for reform

Full text: Activists and political leaders calling for state and federal police reform said Wednesday that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's conviction for murdering George Floyd shouldn't slow that push.
"This white hot spotlight that has been on Minnesota can't leave now," Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday morning in a "CBS This Morning" interview. "My fear: Everybody packs up and we think we've got this."
Chauvin's conviction on Tuesday is the first time in Minnesota history that a white police officer was convicted of murdering a Black person. While activists hailed the Hennepin County jury's decision, they point to last week's fatal police shooting in Brooklyn Center -- and other cases around the country -- as evidence that more laws need to be changed.
"Unfortunately the recent horrific killing of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center shows that more urgent action is needed to change state law," leaders of a coalition of 38 progressive groups wrote in a letter Wednesday to state leaders.
But in remarks on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday morning, Republican Majority Leader Paul Gazelka suggested that the Chauvin verdict demonstrated that the current system worked.
"As we watched the verdict yesterday, I don't think anybody can say that justice wasn't served and so we have a process that works," Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said in response to a DFL
colleague who pressed him on whether the Republican majority would take up measures sought by Walz and his fellow Democrats.
Gazelka said the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings at the end of next week on some measures sought by the House Democratic majority. But he offered no assurances of any votes by the full Senate.
Meanwhile, state Senate Republicans are pushing a bill for harsher penalties against people arrested while protesting. Individuals could be subject to loss of student financial aid and other government benefits, among other consequences.
House Democrats were on track Wednesday to vote on a public safety package that incorporates many police accountability measures sought by activists. That includes new limits on when police can pull over vehicles.
Among the violations no longer eligible for a stop would be expired tabs and items hanging from a rearview mirror. Police say Wright was pulled over for expired plates.
"Yes, the verdict was important," said Rep. Carlos Mariani, DFL-St. Paul. "But it should just be the beginning, not the end."
Other provisions in that package would let local communities form police oversight groups and would bar police officers from affiliation with known hate groups.
A similar dynamic is in play in Washington, D.C., where the Biden White House and congressional Democrats hope to pass federal legislation called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. It aims to prohibit racial profiling in federal, state and local policing, beefs up conduct training standards and details a chokehold ban for federal law enforcement similar to what the Minnesota Legislature passed last year at the state level.
The federal bill offers "the best chance we have at passing immediate reform," U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said in a statement.
The bill passed the House, but it faces an uncertain fate in the closely divided U.S. Senate, where it would need some support from Republicans unless Democrats decide to eliminate the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation to advance.
"I sincerely hope that we are able to make some progress but it's not going to be easy," Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. said in a statement.
Her Democratic colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, pledged in a statement of her own to "keep fighting" to pass police reform.
Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, said in a statement Wednesday he's "encouraged by the conversations I'm having with fellow senators on both sides of the aisle, and am hopeful we can find a path forward on meaningful policing reform."
Among Senate Republicans, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has been the leading voice on possible changes. The only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate told reporters Wednesday there were still some "outstanding issues" for him in the police reform debate, but he said he's still optimistic for a breakthrough.
"I think we are on the verge of wrapping this up in the next week or two, depending on how quickly they respond to our suggestions," Scott said.
Scott and U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., championed an alternative effort last year they called the JUSTICE Act. While it doesn't go as far as what Democrats want, there are some similarities in the two proposals.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Biden feels "the bar for convicting officers is far too high; it needs to be changed."
Biden is set to give his first address to a joint session of Congress next week.
The Minnesota Legislature must adjourn its regular session by May 17, and needs to pass a two-year state budget by June 30 to avoid a government shutdown. Gazelka was noncommittal about the fate of further police accountability measures.
"There may be something, I'm not saying we will not, I just know that we have to pass the budget bills," he said.

Feds launch MPD probe: DOJ WILL LOOK FOR SYSTEMIC BIAS IN POLICING ; Announcement came after jury found Chauvin guilty

Author: Mannix, Andy

Full text: The U.S. Department of Justice will undertake a sweeping investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a "pattern and practice" of illegal conduct, including whether officers used excessive force during protests.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the investigation Wednesday, the morning after a Hennepin County jury found ex-officer Derek Chauvin guilty in the murder of George Floyd. Garland said he has watched closely as Minneapolis has reeled from the trauma of police violence.
"Yesterday's verdict in the state criminal trial does not address potentially systemic policing issues in Minneapolis," Garland said.
The investigation, welcomed by 12 City Council members, Mayor Jacob Frey and the police chief, will seek to establish whether the state's largest police department is engaging in practices that promote or allow systemic wrongdoing.
Justice Department investigators will go inside the walls of the police department and out in the community to talk to potential victims.
"This isn't about one officer -- it's about the whole department," said acting Minnesota U.S. Attorney Anders Folk. The process is going to take "months and months," so people should not expect rapid change, Folk said.
The pattern and practice probe will run parallel to the Justice Department's civil rights investigation into Chauvin. Leading up to the trial, the federal prosecutors ramped up calling witnesses before a grand jury, signaling a possible round of federal civil rights charges for Chauvin. Sources familiar with those secretive proceedings say federal prosecutors are investigating Chauvin's use of force on Floyd and a 2017 arrest during which Chauvin pinned a 14-year-old with his knee.
The investigation will also be separate from the Minnesota Department of Human Rights probe, announced after Floyd's death, which will look at policies, procedures and practices over the past 10 years, and whether the department engaged in systemic discrimination.
The decision to open a pattern and practice investigation in Minneapolis is a reversal from the Trump administration, which effectively abandoned these types of far-reaching probes into police departments. In the weeks after George Floyd's death last spring, then-Attorney General Bill Barr drew criticism when he refused to order such an investigation of the Minneapolis department.
This investigation will focus on whether Minneapolis police engaged in a pattern of unlawful excessive force, discriminatory policing, use of force against activities protected by the First Amendment and use of force that flouts laws protecting people with mental illnesses and disabilities. It will also assess the police department's systems of accountability, and whether new mechanisms should be implemented to protect the constitutional rights of people in Minneapolis.
Garland said he believes most of the nation's police behave lawfully and honorably. "I strongly believe that good officers do not want to work in systems that allow bad practices," he said. "Accountability is an essential part of building trust with the community, and public safety requires public trust."
If the Justice Department finds systemic wrongdoing, it will report its findings to the public. The federal civil rights division will seek to work with Minneapolis police, with input from the community, to identify ways to address the deficiencies.
If the civil rights division can't reach an agreement with Minneapolis on how to reform the police department, the Justice Department has authority to file a lawsuit to force changes.
Chief vows cooperation
City officials, who learned of the investigation a half-hour before the public did, applauded the Justice Department for using its authority to reform Minneapolis police.
Every Minneapolis City Council member except for Alondra Cano signed onto a statement saying they "fully support" the federal investigators in holding accountable "any and all abuses of power and harms to our community and stand ready to aid in this process as full partners."
"The City Council's oversight of the Minneapolis Police Department has been historically constrained by the City Charter and state law and we welcome new tools to pursue transformational, structural changes to how the City provides for public safety."
Frey also released a statement welcoming the investigation, saying Minneapolis must seize on this "generational opportunity" to improve life for the Black community.
Police Chief Medaria Arradondo has pledged to "cooperate fully," according to a statement from the department. "The Chief has been insistent that he wants to make the MPD the best department possible."
Activists who have been calling for substantial police reforms, including some who want to abolish the department, responded to news of the federal probe with mixed reviews.
Black Visions, a group that wants Minneapolis to radically rethink its public safety system, called the Justice Department's announcement a "distraction."
"The police investigating themselves will never result in needed changes to truly provide public safety to the people of Minneapolis and greater Minnesota," said spokesperson Kennedy-Ezra Kastle. "The MPD has shown the public and community time and time again that they do not care about the safety of Black people or the larger community."
D.A. Bullock of Reclaim the Block expressed similar skepticism: "Minneapolis' violent and murderous police department is built on the Obama Justice Department model of 21st century policing. We don't expect real change to come out of the DOJ."
Other activists and civil rights leaders held a news conference outside the courthouse Wednesday, where they said a pattern and practice investigation is long overdue but wanted investigators to expand the scope.
"We have been asking for DOJ assistance -- real assistance -- since at least 2001," said Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality. "We have a toxic culture of police in this state, and not just in one department."
The Minneapolis police union declined to comment.
Similar case in Chicago
The probe in Minneapolis shares similarities with the Justice Department's investigation into the Chicago Police Department. Both were instigated by police killings of Black men that were initially falsely characterized by police officials.
In Chicago, dash-camera footage showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald as he walked away from the officer. The video, released by court order 13 months after the shooting, disproved the police department's report that McDonald had been acting erratically and lunged at the officer with a knife. Many accused Chicago police of trying to cover up a murder.
Similarly, in Minneapolis, a police department spokesman released a statement after Floyd's death, titled: "Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction." The news release described a suspected money forger who "physically resisted" police, during which time the officers "noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress."
Cellphone footage recorded by a bystander and published online revealed Floyd died pleading for his life while being restrained by three police officers. Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder blamed the misleading news release on not having all the facts in a fluid situation.
In 2017, after an investigation lasting nearly two years into the Chicago department, the Justice Department announced it had found a pattern of illegal use of force stemming from "systemic deficiencies in training and accountability." The city of Chicago signed an agreement to create a federal court-enforceable consent decree addressing the problems.

Verdict resonates among activists

Full text: The historic guilty verdicts against Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd particularly resonated among Twin Cities activists, who call it the opening round in a struggle to end longstanding police violence inflicted on people of color.
Some said the jury decision that convicted Chauvin on all three murder and manslaughter counts in Hennepin County District Court likely saved the city from destructive riots had he been found not guilty.
Retired Hennepin County Judge LaJune Lange, who is Black, praised the jury decision. "This is the most important case since Dred Scott for Minnesota and the nation," she said. "This is the first time in Minnesota that a jury has valued a Black man when killed in police custody."
Jody Nelson, executive director of Change Inc., a community-building agency in the Twin Cities, said she was hopeful that the decision will open a new chapter for the American judicial system.
"Justice has come to the Black community after being denied justice for over 400 years," she said. "Police departments across the country are on notice that the depraved mind has no place in policing."
Corey Byrd, director of Youth and Family Engagement for Change Inc., said that if the jury had not done "the right thing â€¦ we would have been on fire. Cities around the country would have burned. By doing the right the thing, [Minnesota] saved humanity. Minnesota is showing the world that we do have humanity, we do believe in life."
"I am now hoping that people celebrate but understand this is still not over in terms of what's happening around the country," said Peter Hayden, founder and CEO of Turning Point, a North Side chemical health agency where Floyd sought addiction treatment. "We still have issues of how other people see us, people of color, including the police," he continued. "All police aren't bad, but because they felt they had to protect each other, that ... caused the problem."
Dave Bicking, a member of Communities United Against Police Brutality, hailed the jury decision, but said he believes that the Minneapolis police and city government bear even more of the guilt than Chauvin "because they created the conditions for this to happen. [They have] a lack of accountability. â€¦. Derek Chauvin was still training these rookie officers as he knelt on George Floyd's neck. We still have the bulk of our work to do because the city has not changed the conditions that led to this."
Monique Cullars-Doty, co-founder of Blacks Live Matter Minnesota and Black Lives Twin Cities Metro, said she had a sense of relief, but that will never bring Floyd back.
"I feel relieved the family got what the judicial system could provide because Black men in Minnesota don't get that," she said. "I â€¦ hope that the family can take comfort that Derek Chauvin is off the streets."
Jae Yates, speaking for the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice for Jamar, said, "We got the verdict that we deserve." He said the focus now shifts to obtaining justice for Daunte Wright, recently shot by Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter, as well as pressing the effort "for community control of the police."
Pastor Richard Pittman, president of the St. Paul Roy Wilkins branch of the NAACP, said the world's attention was focused on Minnesota.
"We were waiting to exhale. But now, we can breathe," he said. "George Floyd said, 'I can't breathe' and today, the whole world can breathe a little better because of [the verdict]." He added, "There needs to be policy changes, policing changes, and systemic racism needs to be eradicated out of the criminal justice system."
William C. Jordan Jr., president of the Minnesota/Dakotas Area Conference NAACP, called the verdict a "small victory" but noted that there are other issues be to faced including the trial this summer for three other Minneapolis police officers for their alleged complicity in Floyd's death, along with the campaign for "true police reform."
Rev. James Thomas of Mount Olivet Baptist Church in St. Paul and president of the St. Paul Black Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, said it was "about time that we have had a police officer held accountable for the loss of life. So, I am elated. I am happy."
The Rev. Jerry McAfee, minister at New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Minneapolis and a longtime civil rights activist, said he was "relieved but still pained" because of other Black people who died at the hands of police in Minneapolis. "We are grateful without a doubt. People asked me, what will [Attorney General] Keith [Ellison] do, and I always told them, Keith will do what he normally does and put on the best case he can possibly get. â€¦. Mike Freeman was part of that team. And Mike lent his support and his voice because Mike was the first prosecutor to get a conviction of a Minneapolis police officer," referring to the conviction of Mohamed Noor, sentenced in 2019 in the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Toshira Garraway, founder of Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence in the Twin Cities, said she was "grateful that finally, for once, our system has done the right thing and a held a guilty person in law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing against a Black man." But she said there were many other law enforcement officers in Minnesota who have killed Black people "that led up to George Floyd. We need the rest of these officers held accountable for these murders."

At wake, Daunte Wright called 'a child of America'

Full text: On Katie and Aubrey Wright's wedding anniversary, they received hugs and flowers, but not in celebration of their marriage.
They gathered with loved ones at Shiloh Temple International Ministries in north Minneapolis for the wake of their 20-year-old son, Daunte Demetrius Wright, who was shot and killed by a former Brooklyn Center police officer April 11.
"For them to have to spend this evening under these circumstances, we got to give them a wedding gift: justice," said civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton.
At the wake, a slide show of images showed Wright in his youth, holding a basketball trophy and wearing an Air Jordan headband with a gold medal hanging from his neck. Images showed him smiling, surrounded by his now grieving family and friends.
Wright played center for the basketball team at Edison High School with the No. 23 jersey, his favorite number.
"He was a star athlete," according to his obituary, which described him as a "jokester" and "a warm and loving person who would do anything for his family and friends."
He loved the Fourth of July, sharing good times with his family and his son, whom he spent months with in intensive care when he was born four months prematurely in 2019.
Born in St. Paul on Oct. 27, 2000, and raised in Minneapolis from the time he was 7, Wright was "taken from his family and friends too soon and leaves a hole in their heart that will never be filled," his obituary read.
Katie Wright said she and her husband have been married two years, but together for 23. The interracial family is full of "harmony and love," and former officer Kim Potter stole that from them, Sharpton said.
"This couple has stayed together and brought their family together. And for you to rob them of their child," Sharpton said.
"They didn't raise their children to hate. ... You brought hate into their families and we will run it out and get them justice."
Potter, a 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, faces one charge of second-degree manslaughter in the death of Wright, who was killed during a traffic stop for driving with expired tabs, according to police.
Potter, who is white, used a Glock 9-millimeter handgun to shoot Wright in apparent confusion after saying in the moments before shooting that she planned to use her Taser, police said. Potter resigned two days later.
Sharpton said when Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts for the murder of George Floyd, he couldn't help but think about what happened in Brooklyn Center.
"People celebrated all over the country," he said, "As I was crying, the thing that bothered me was right down the road was Daunte Wright. â€¦ Don't tell us what you did for George Floyd and ignore what happened to Daunte Wright. â€¦ We're going to get Wright right in Minnesota."
Attorney Ben Crump, who represented the Floyd family, is also representing the Wright family.
"Even though he was the birth child of Aubrey and Katie Wright, he became a child of America," Crump said. "People all over America saw their child in Daunte."
Wright's funeral is scheduled for noon Thursday at Shiloh Temple.

Jury vote worried Wolves: Players were nervous over the Chauvin trial verdict.

Full text: Josh Okogie didn't want to hear the verdict as it was read in the trial of Derek Chauvin on Tuesday afternoon, so Okogie took his usual pregame nap before the Timberwolves played the Kings that night.
"Part of me didn't really want to hear it live," Okogie said after the Wolves' 134-120 win over Sacramento. "I wanted to just wake up to the news."
Karl-Anthony Towns said he was sweating so much before the verdict came down he had to take another shower.
"I didn't know how it was going to go," Towns said. "We've seen moments like this so much that go the opposite way that even with how quick the verdict came in, you still have no idea where it's going to go."
But Towns said there was a "sense of relief" when jurors convicted Chauvin of murdering George Floyd. Okogie said the jury's guilty verdicts on counts of second- and third-degree murder along with second-degree manslaughter represented a victory for accountability.
"A lot of people call it justice. For me it's accountability more than anything," Okogie said. "To me if justice was really served, George Floyd would still be here today. â€¦ I think the court made the right decisions and I hope this sets a precedent for other cops around the world who, you know, I don't want to say try to, but kill innocent minorities.
"I hope this slows down the amount of shootings that are happening in the world right now."
Okogie and Towns attended a rally in downtown Minneapolis near where the trial of Chauvin took place shortly after Floyd's death last May.
Both have been vocal in using their platforms to raise awareness for police brutality and advocating for ending systemic racism, and struck a note of optimism after Tuesday's verdict.
Okogie said he hoped the verdict would be an important moment in reversing trends of police avoiding conviction in similar cases.
"There's a lot of reform that needs to be made," Okogie said. "Police reform is one of them. There's also educational reform. There's a whole bunch of different ones, but I think focusing on police reform, this is a good first step."
Towns said one of the regrettable feelings he had waiting for the verdict was that, despite the video evidence in the case, he still wasn't 100% sure a guilty verdict would come.
"We live in a world where you can catch someone in high-definition video and still we're talking about, 'Is there going to be a guilty verdict?' " Towns said. "That's a scary world we live in. You can have something in 4K, have it clear as day, showing the people, and still have concern that accountability will be actually given and justice will be served."
Guard D'Angelo Russell, who held a wide-ranging discussion with reporters after the storming of the Capitol on Jan.6, did the same again in his media availability after the game. Despite being relatively new to Minneapolis, he still had a hopeful outlook for his new home.
"It's accountability first and foremost, I think that's a start," Russell said. "Obviously we want change to be this big and grand in the scheme of things, but looking at the small window that we have, I think that change is happening every day."

Athletes, teams say verdict is first step: Many said justice was served but added much more needs to be done.

Full text: Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill read three guilty verdicts against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd at 4:07 p.m. Tuesday in Minneapolis.
Three hours before, the owners of the Twins, the Pohlad family, released a statement saying the deaths of Floyd and Daunte Wright showed "just how toxic and prevalent systemic and individual racism are to our community."
That statement before the verdict, and sentiments from sports figures around the state after it, reflected the deeply personal nature of this trial for Minnesota athletes and franchises who have put forward a heightened effort toward social justice issues over the past year in the wake of Floyd's killing.
And those issues have only been reignited following the shooting of Wright by a police officer during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center on April 11.
So on a day when the nation was watching a courtroom in Minneapolis, the verdict elicited a flood of responses from every corner of Minnesota's sports community.
Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns -- whose first public appearance in the wake of his mother's death last year came in downtown Minneapolis to protest the killing of Floyd -- tweeted (@KarlTowns) "Justice and Accountability! Things I never thought I would see. There's more work to do, but this is an amazing start working toward the reform this country NEEDS!"
Lynx guard Crystal Dangerfield tweeted (@crystald2_) "The world was watching. Accountability was the first step !! They got it right â€¦ GUILTY !!!"
University of Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle said in a news release: "We are appreciative that the jury reached a verdict and that justice was served. The murder of Mr. George Floyd was senseless and tragic and it shook our city, state and country."
Ex-Gophers quarterback Seth Green, who played at East Ridge High School and protested Floyd's killing on the I-35W bridge last year, tweeted (@seth_mgreen), "Accountability."
Twins center fielder Byron Buxton (@officialbuck103), before taking the field at Oakland, tweeted an emoji of a Black heart.
Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said the verdict was about more than criminal justice. "This is real life stuff that, when we walk out our front doors, that we see," he said. "When it does affect you like that, it does mean a lot to you. I pray for the community. I pray for everyone out there."
Wolves coach Chris Finch, in his pregame news conference at Sacramento, noted the weight his players felt. "It's something that's weighing on them every day," he said. "Whether it be National Guards in our street or the Brooklyn Center protests. These are things we can't escape."
After the Wolves' victory, Josh Okogie said the team dedicated the game ball to Floyd's family.
"A lot of people call it justice. For me it's more accountability more than anything," the Wolves guard said. "To me if justice was really served, George Floyd would still be here today."
And Towns said that in anticipation of the verdict, he was sweating so much he had to take a shower.
"I was worried," Towns said. "I was worried for our community, I was worried justice wasn't going to be served. ... It's unfortunate that our city has been going through so much, but I hope that today was a step towards reform."
The Vikings noted in their statement that this moment was about continuing that dialogue of reform: "Now, more than ever, it is crucial to respectfully listen, communicate and engage in order for us to move toward an equitable society. We must address the unacceptable continued violence and hate toward People of Color."
And while Tuesday's verdict was treated as a moment of justice by sports figures across the state, it was also viewed as a continuation point.
Local pro teams dedicated more than $40 million to social justice causes over the past year and looked internally at how to be more equitable in the workplace. Their response to the verdict looked forward.
"We are humbled by the scope of what needs to be accomplished and remain steadfast in our commitment to support the work of ending racial injustice in our community," the Pohlads wrote. "In the days and weeks ahead, please listen and treat each other with compassion and respect as we work through this together."
Or, as the Vikings put it, "Our work is just beginning."

Full text: WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden said George Floyd's death illustrated the systemic racism that is a "stain on our nation's soul."
And even after a jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty Tuesday on all three counts in Floyd's killing, the president made clear the United States has much work ahead to achieve racial justice.
"No one should be above the law and today's verdict sends that message," Biden said. "But it's not enough. We can't stop here."
"In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood" that similar tragedies happen again, said the Democratic president.
While Tuesday allowed for "a sigh of relief," Vice President Kamala Harris said "a measure of justice isn't the same as equal justice."
"This verdict brings us a step closer, and the fact is we still have work to do," Harris said. "We still must reform the system."
In their remarks to the nation, both Biden and Harris repeated their push for the Senate to pass the police reform bill written by Democrats called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. However, that package, which has cleared the House, appears doomed in the Senate given the fierce GOP opposition to the wide-ranging changes championed by the left.
Before Biden and Harris spoke Tuesday night, Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump tweeted a video of Biden and Harris on the phone with the family after the guilty verdicts were announced.
The president could be heard saying that "we're all so relieved."
Harris added, "We really do believe that with your leadership and the president that we have in the White House, that we're going to make something good come out of this tragedy."
"The guilty verdict does not bring back George," Biden said Tuesday night.
"But through the family's pain, they're finding purpose, so George's legacy will not be just about his death, but about what we must do in his memory."

Full text: From eyewitnesses to use-of-force and medical experts, along with police officers, 44 witnesses took the stand over three weeks of testimony in ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's trial for second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. The prosecution called 37 witnesses, while the defense called seven. Chauvin was convicted on all counts. Here are some key witnesses.
Donald Williams
Williams was a witness at the scene of 38th and Chicago and among the most vocal in urging Chauvin to get off Floyd, and for officer Tou Thao to intervene. Proficient in wrestling and mixed martial arts, he said Chauvin placed a "blood choke" on Floyd, restricting his circulation. "I called the police on the police," he testified. Asked why, he said, "Because I believe I witnessed a murder."
Genevieve Hansen
Hansen, a Minneapolis firefighter, was off-duty and out for a walk when she came upon the scene. She attempted to render aid to Floyd but was rebuffed by officers and told to stay back. Still, she repeatedly pleaded for them to check his pulse. "There is a man being killed, and I would have been able to provide medical attention to the best of my abilities, and this human was not provided that right."
Courteney Ross
George Floyd's girlfriend of three years. She met him at the Salvation Army Harbor Lights shelter where he worked as a security guard. She testified that they both struggled off and on with opioid addiction after both suffered chronic pain. "Both Floyd and I, our story is a classic story of how we both got addicted to opioids. â€¦ We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times."
Medaria Arradondo
Minneapolis police chief who testified of his department's training and policies, and how he learned of what happened the night Floyd was killed. "Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting -- and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that -- that should have stopped," the chief said after spelling out department policy on when to use force compared to using de-escalation tactics.
Dr. Martin Tobin
A physician in pulmonology and critical care in Chicago. He concluded that Floyd died from "a low level of oxygen. This caused damage to his brain that we see, and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop." Floyd stopped breathing and "didn't have an ounce of oxygen in his body" less than a minute after losing consciousness, Tobin said.
Dr. Andrew Baker
Chief Hennepin County medical examiner who performed Floyd's autopsy and stood by his ruling that Floyd's death was a homicide caused by "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression." The doctor tied in Floyd's "very severe underlying heart disease" and enlarged heart, combined with the stress of being pinned to the asphalt.
Barry Brodd
A use-of-force expert for the defense, Brodd testified that he believed Chauvin's actions were reasonable. Brodd, a former police officer in California, said it's important for anyone "to try to see it as the officer on the scene â€¦ then try to put yourself in the officer's shoes. It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct." Brodd said he didn't believe the "prone control" position was use of force.
Dr. David Fowler
Fowler, an expert medical witness, recently retired as chief medical examiner for Maryland. He testified that Floyd died of cardiac arrest combined with illicit drugs in his body and not from a lack of oxygen. He would have classified Floyd's manner of death as undetermined due to the multiple factors he cited. The doctor said that carbon monoxide from the police squad could have been a factor.

Full text: George Floyd didn't just die. George Floyd was murdered.
The guilty verdict on all three counts against Derek Chauvin in a Minneapolis courtroom on Tuesday not only penalized the act by the former Minneapolis police officer, but recognized the tragedy we all witnessed in a viral video from Memorial Day.
It also opened a door. There is still time for Minnesota to become the best version of itself, if we harness the energy around this collective demand for change.
I believe I owe that to my daughters. I believe we owe that to ourselves and the next generation. Although the darkness still lingers -- Daunte Wright has not been buried yet, three more officers will be tried in George Floyd's killing and Kim Potter will also have her day in court -- the sun poked through the clouds on Tuesday. And I know we have to latch onto that light, even if we can only see it in one another.
I saw that light in that video. A 9-year-old girl advocated for George Floyd. Donald Williams and an off-duty EMT tried to help, too. And paramedics who could not bring him back to life did what they could. They all, with their actions, said George Floyd mattered.
I saw that light when Facebook messages announcing rallies and seeking solidarity percolated through my timeline. Also, when folks organized GoFundMe initiatives to support the push for racial equity. I saw that light when young people across this state left their classrooms to demand an end to racism and homophobia this week. I could see it when companies and organizations acknowledged their shortcomings after Floyd was killed and re-examined their leadership structures.
I saw that light again on Tuesday when the verdict was announced. On Hennepin Avenue, a young Black woman with red and black braids waved a Black Lives Matter flag through the sunroof of her SUV. A little girl in the adjacent car rolled her window down and held up her fist. A car full of white guys, two cars behind them, honked their horns and cheered.
I could hear singing. I could see people smiling. Minnesota felt hopeful again after a step toward progress. This is what Minnesota can become.
But only if it admits what it is.
This is the same place where hangings in Duluth and Mankato marked two of this nation's greatest tragedies nearly 100 years ago. This is a place that did not embrace the South's brand of Jim Crow racism but instead quietly stitched discrimination into its policies and laws.
Some of the suburbs in the Twin Cities that often crack the "Best Places to Live in America" lists once banned nonwhite residents. They were white utopias because only white people could live there. Redlining painted pristine neighborhoods white, too. This is a place that built a highway through a prominent Black neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s.
In Minnesota, white students thrive and Black students are frequently left behind, proven by the perennial gap between the groups. This is a place where Daunte Wright was killed days before we heard a verdict in the Chauvin trial.
But the shields must be removed to have a real conversation about progress.
Minnesotans love to brand themselves according to their politics. But the concept of inclusion is a trophy on the wall of too many white Minnesotans, folks who will tell you who they voted for in the most recent election when you ask them to consider the implications of racism here.
They'll also mention their nonwhite friends or the fabulous Ethiopian or Vietnamese restaurant they enjoy. But sometimes, they will refuse to acknowledge their lack of tangible relationships with people who do not look like them. Minnesota Nice, as it pertains to racism, has been historically apathetic, harmful and dangerous.
Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd. But a climate that has historically dehumanized Black bodies did nothing to deter him. Minnesotans must consider that.
But there was light on Tuesday. Amid the heaviness, I could see it.
There are people here who will continue to fight, even when the national spotlight disappears. There are partnerships and alliances. There are people who've invested their time and resources, across the state, to create a future where Minnesota is no longer the hub of police killings.
I think I exhaled for the first time in nearly a year on Tuesday. And the honking horns and cheers on the streets of downtown Minneapolis were encouraging.
I know there are Minnesotans who want something else, something better than this, so that we're not living in this cycle of violence against Black bodies. I know Minnesotans would like to talk to their friends across the country about something that does not involve another tragedy. But this place has been stamped, not just because of today but because yesterday keeps happening.
Tuesday, however, presented a step toward a new day. For the first time in a long time, I could see the light.

CONVICTED: JURY FINDS DEREK CHAUVIN GUILTY OF MURDER ; MINNESOTA AND WORLD REACT TO VERDICT: 'GEORGE FLOYD MATTERED' ; A MOMENTOUS DAY IN THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE

Full text: A mass cheer rose up from the south lawn of the Hennepin County courthouse the moments the verdicts were read inside: guilty, guilty, guilty.
At a downtown hotel not far away, Spike Moss watched alongside George Floyd's family as Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder. The 74-year-old Minneapolis civil rights activist sat down and teared up.
"We finally won one," he said, thanking God that he had lived long enough to see a victory for which he had fought his whole life.
It was far from a unanimous moment of elation in this divided country, but many advocates for racial equality took a moment to soak in what they saw as a rare instance of justice for Black Americans.
Minnesota civil rights icon Josie Johnson, 90, said she was stunned when she heard that Chauvin had been convicted of all three counts, including second-degree murder.
"It is such a surprise, and a sense of relief, that I have lived long enough to see this happen," she said. "That this may help us see justice as a society -- that's my prayer. I've lived long enough to see this happen, and I've lived long enough to see a Black man elected president. I've seen a country that reacted in such a way of hurt in seeing what happened to George Floyd. That gave me a sense of hope."
But she emphasized that the hope Chauvin's conviction symbolized can become a historical touchstone only if the lessons learned from the trial help change not just policing but a society where Black Americans are treated unequally.
"I'm just fearful that unless we can talk about this and express our real fears and concerns, I don't know it will last long enough," she said. "I'm praying that it will. If we are successful, I think people will look back and see that this was the beginning of a new era."
The aftermath of Tuesday's verdict was filled with attempts to place the moment in history.
George Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd said Emmett Till was "the first George Floyd," and pointed to the importance of the video taken by a bystander: "It was a motion picture," he said.
Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton said that while he does not celebrate Chauvin going to jail, the moment would change the world. He talked about President Joe Biden visiting Floyd's family last year.
"He sat there, and I will never forget, he said to George's daughter, 'I heard you say your father is going to change the world,' " Sharpton said. "Well, we can now tell George's daughter she was right."
Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice organization Color of Change, said that while this moment was one trial for one police officer, the greater movement spurred by Floyd's murder symbolizes something bigger.
"This is a new moment in American history," he said. "True justice can't be delivered by 12 jurors. It can be delivered by millions of people winning systemic change, by ending the two sets of rules we have in this country, the two sets of policing. That's the work ahead, and that's the fight ahead."
Andrea Jenkins, the vice president of the Minneapolis City Council, put the moment in the context of centuries: "White supremacy is at the very core of this country's founding," she said. "But today, today justice was served. Police accountability was handed out. It gives us a little more hope."
Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, who was killed by a suburban Twin Cities police officer in 2016, watched the trial with her daughter on the couch in her living room. When the verdict came in, she cried and praised God: "Thank you, Lord! Thank you, heavenly father!"
The police officer who shot her son was acquitted, but Castile saw Chauvin's conviction as a sign of progress.
"Minnesota is moving in a positive direction," she said. "Everyone didn't get justice, but I think holding police officers accountable is the right thing to do."
Ball State University history Prof. Max Felker-Kantor pointed out plenty of optimism in the conviction. He noted that it was significant that Chauvin was found guilty on all three charges, especially because in so many police killings of Blacks there has been a failure to even go to trial.
He pointed out that the Chauvin jury was more racially diverse than the jury that found the officers not guilty in Rodney King's beating in Los Angeles a generation ago, and that Floyd's death started more substantive nationwide conversations about the problems in policing than in that 1991 case. And Chauvin's fellow officers, including the Minneapolis police chief, testifying against him was a marked change in culture, he said.
But he and others offered a note of caution to those celebrating the conviction: It was one man who was on trial, not the system of which he was a part.
"Derek Chauvin being found guilty does not mean that the problems of policing have been solved in American society," he said. "There's a danger to portraying it as an overwhelming victory. â€¦ There's bigger questions about policing that I think we need to continue to reckon with."
Steven Belton, president of Urban League Twin Cities, said he was heartened by the verdict. "I am not, however, convinced that this is an inflection culturally or from the perspective of broader society. I am not counseling my own Black sons that they can throw caution to the wind and that they can expect to be treated fairly by police everywhere. â€¦ We're still waiting to see if this is a moment or a movement."
He suggested that the conviction came about because "they got caught with a smoking gun" in the form of a video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd. He questioned whether police would have testified against Chauvin or believed the witnesses' claims about his treatment of Floyd if 17-year-old bystander Darnella Frazier had not filmed it with her phone.
"That's what made the difference," said Belton. "So the reason I'm skeptical, or at least waiting patiently to see whether this is an inflection, is because every case is not going to have that."
Bishop Harding Smith, who got to know Floyd in their work with the homeless, urged people not to view Chauvin's actions as an isolated case.
"Derek Chauvin just didn't happen overnight," said Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God in Robbinsdale. "Derek Chauvin was nurtured. He was protected and he was groomed by the Police Department." Chauvin acted the way he did on May 25 "because he felt that this department would have his back."
Smith asked: "How many other Derek Chauvins are there in the Minneapolis Police Department? I can tell you this: He's not the only one."
He said he's happy about the verdict, but "we have been down this road before and until we as Americans -- until we as a people -- can look deep within ourselves and change our racist attitudes, we're going to be back here again six months from now."
On Tuesday morning in Boston, Phillipe Copeland stood in his kitchen and burst into tears. As an assistant director at Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research, Copeland has spent a lot of time thinking about the meaning of this moment, and its heaviness. The uncertainty of justice, the constant tensions of being a Black man in America -- weighed on him. When he watched the verdict being read, it brought a strange feeling: numbness. The verdict didn't bring back Floyd. The verdict didn't suddenly cure the generations of dehumanization that burdened him.
But it was something.
"We go through these rituals as a society where we offer up sacrifices on the altar of retribution and call it justice," he said. "This case really dramatizes how insufficient that ritual is. There are things that punishment, that convicting an individual, cannot do. So we have to do something else. We have to do something more."
In the downtown Minneapolis hotel where he watched the verdict alongside Floyd's family, Moss, the longtime civil rights activist, thought back on a lifetime of fighting uphill battles against police brutality. He's been doing this work since 1966, but he always felt thwarted by "Minnesota racism." This time, he said, the evidence was undeniable.
"I had to sit down and take a breath and just tear up because that was my lifelong battle," he said. "I was vilified every way for standing up. â€¦ I just never stopped fighting, so I'm proud of [protesters and Floyd's family] because they kept fighting."

Full text: At George Floyd Square and at the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis, crowds grew quiet as the court's judgment approached. When the verdict was read, jubilation and relief swelled: "All three! All three!" shouted a man at the courthouse, joining a procession through downtown, at top. At the square, the gathering ballooned to hundreds by evening, with hugs, music, food and tears flowing freely. Caprice Overstreet, above center, wept after the verdict. She had called her two grown sons that day: "I just need to hear your voice." At the nearby Say Their Names Cemetery, left, quiet prevailed.

Full text: The bystander video of Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds gave prosecutors a star witness for the Hennepin County murder case against the fired officer.
Prosecutors played the video in opening statements, telling jurors to trust what they saw. The globally viral video of Floyd's life draining away as he cried "Mama" landed an emotional gut punch.
Then prosecutors brought the crime to life over the trial's first three days with a series of anguished eyewitnesses taking the witness stand. There was the 61-year-old man from the neighborhood, several teenage girls with cellphones, a 9-year-old girl out to buy snacks with her cousin, a dad who spent the day fishing and the 18-year-old Cup Foods clerk haunted because he told his boss that the $20 bill Floyd used to buy cigarettes was a fake.
Minneapolis criminal defense lawyer Fred Goetz said the overwhelming heartbreak of the eyewitnesses pulled the jurors right into the scene.
"Once that powerful emotional connection was made, the defense certainly had great challenges in overcoming that with a rational evidence-based argument," Goetz said. "When you make a powerful first emotional impression, it's exceedingly difficult to get a jury to put that aside."
Several legal analysts said prosecutors came into the trial with the evidence on their side, and used it flawlessly. After the eyewitnesses, they called a series of high-ranking police officers to the stand who denounced Chauvin. Then came medical experts who deftly explained the science of how the lungs and heart work.
Retired Hennepin County District Judge Kevin Burke said prosecutors in the case provided "compelling evidence" and made no mistakes. He praised the prosecution's tone, calling it "respectful."
Carolyn Grose, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said prosecutors weren't heavy-handed. They let the community and the evidence "speak for itself," she said. "The defense was saying, 'Don't believe what you see. The jury's bottom line was, 'No, we believe what we see.' "
Also significant, she said, was "getting the other cops to make an indictment of one of their own."
Sheila Bedi, professor and director of the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, said the video itself "was just so brutal that the defense was asking the jury to not believe its eyes and that was impossible for the jury to do."
While it's become increasingly common for the public to see video captured by police body-worn cameras, the bystander video provided the unique perspective of Chauvin and Floyd together. Their reactions in the video obliterated the possibility of Chauvin successfully using the "reasonable officer" defense because it was clear that neither Floyd nor the crowd were threats, Bedi said.
"The reasonable police officer standard has excused brutal acts for so long," she said.
University of Minnesota Law Prof. Jon Lee also said the prosecution team of Jerry Blackwell, Steve Schleicher, Matthew Frank and Erin Eldridge told a compelling narrative about Floyd throughout the trial. They put the jury "in the position of George Floyd" by walking them through his life, loves and struggles -- and then contrasted that with the "lack of humanity" shown by Chauvin, he said.
Lee said the string of police officers, including Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, condemning Chauvin's actions gave the jury permission to condemn him as well. He also had high praise for the state's medical experts, who talked about complex issues in ways that were easy to understand.
The state's main argument was that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because of the restraint from Chauvin and two other officers set to stand trial in August.
The jury apparently didn't give credence to the defense's two main claims, that Floyd died from pre-existing medical issues and that Chauvin behaved as a reasonable officer would under the circumstances.
Defense lawyer Ryan Pacyga said it was a hard case for defense lawyer Eric Nelson from the beginning. Pacyga said Nelson's attempt to blame the crowd for distracting Chauvin was a dicey move that didn't work.
To drive home the claim that Chauvin acted reasonably, Pacyga said the fired officer needed to take the stand to explain what was going on in his head as he knelt on Floyd. "He's the only one in the world that knows," Pacyga said.
Pacyga conceded it would have been risky, but that Chauvin didn't have much to lose. "He was already the most hated man in America," Pacyga said. "If they don't believe him and they hate him anyway, what have you lost?"

Full text: A sheriff's deputy led former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin away in handcuffs Tuesday after jurors convicted him of murdering George Floyd, a dramatic ending to a case that transfixed the world and became the latest flash point in a raging debate about police brutality against the Black community.
The conviction, almost a year after a bystander video captured Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, was the first time in Minnesota history that a white police officer was convicted of killing a Black civilian on the job.
Jurors deliberated for about nine hours and 45 minutes over two days before finding Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Chauvin, dressed in a shirt and tie and gray suit, glanced around the courtroom as the verdicts were read, and was immediately handcuffed and escorted out of the courtroom by Hennepin County sheriff's deputies when his bail was revoked. Chauvin, who wore a blue surgical face mask as mandated by the court for COVID-19 safety, gave a nod to his attorney, Eric Nelson, as he was led out a back door.
He was transferred to the Minnesota Department of Corrections and booked about 4:55 p.m. into the state prison at Oak Park Heights while he awaits sentencing.
As news spread of the verdicts -- guilty on all counts -- social media sites reposted the Minneapolis Police Department's initial report that Floyd died of a medical event at the scene, an assertion that might never have been contradicted so forcefully were it not for a teenage girl, Darnella Frazier, walking by and recording Floyd's death last May 25 on her cellphone and posting it for the world to see.
"I just cried so hard. This last hour my heart was beating so fast, I was so anxious, anxiety [busting] through the roof," Frazier, who was 17 at the time, posted on Facebook after the verdict. "But to know GUILTY ON ALL 3 CHARGES !!! THANK YOU GOD THANK YOU â€¦ George Floyd we did it!! Justice has been served."
The jury's decision ended a fraught six-week trial that left many community members fearing a possible acquittal and law enforcement officials braced for massive clashes with angry protesters.
The verdicts, read aloud at 4:07 p.m. and streamed live around the world, prompted immediate celebrations in the plaza outside the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis, which until then had hosted somber prayer sessions and vociferous rallies calling for justice.
Before Chauvin was taken away, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill individually polled jurors, each of whom confirmed their verdicts as correctly read. He then thanked them as a group. "I have to thank you on behalf of the people of the state of Minnesota not only for jury service, but heavy-duty jury service," the judge said.
The jurors stared at Cahill until they were called on, remaining still and quiet and displaying no noticeable emotional reactions during the brief proceeding, according to a reporter in the courtroom.
Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office oversaw Chauvin's prosecution, summed up the case simply: "George Floyd mattered." He saluted the "bouquet of humanity" that attempted to intervene and recorded Floyd's final moments.
"They didn't know George Floyd, they didn't know he had a beautiful family, they didn't know that he was a proud father or had people in his life who loved him," Ellison said at a news conference with members of his legal team. "They stopped and they raised their voices because they knew what they were seeing was wrong. They didn't need to be medical or use-of-force experts. They knew it was wrong, and they were right."
Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell followed, saying, "No verdict can bring George Perry Floyd back to us, but this verdict does give a message to his family that his life mattered, that all of our lives matter, and that's important."
Nelson left the courtroom without comment, and did not respond to messages.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, issued a prepared statement in addition to holding a news conference with the family. "Painfully earned justice has arrived for George Floyd's family and the community here in Minneapolis, but today's verdict goes far beyond this city and has significant implications for the country and even the world," the statement said. "Justice for Black America is justice for all of America. This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state."
One of Floyd's younger brothers, Philonise Floyd, clasped his hands over his face as the verdicts were read, according to a reporter who was present. His hands shook as Cahill read the first guilty verdict concerning the second-degree murder count. He nodded after the final guilty verdict on manslaughter was read. Soon, he was weeping and hugging all four prosecutors in the courtroom -- Ellison, Blackwell, Matthew Frank and Steve Schleicher, who wiped away tears from his reddened eyes.
"I was just praying they would find him guilty," Philonise Floyd told a reporter afterward. "As an African American, we usually never get justice."
In a statement, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo thanked the jurors, as well as members of the police department during a "difficult and challenging" year.
"We recognize that our community is hurting, and hearts are heavy with many emotions. However, I have hope," the statement said. "The community that I was born and raised in and that we serve is resilient and together, we can find our moment to begin to heal."
The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, the police union, issued a statement telling residents of the city that the federation "stands with you and not against you."
"There are no winners in this case, and we respect the jury's decision," the statement said. "We need the political pandering to stop and the race-baiting of elected officials to stop. In addition, we need to stop the divisive comments, and we all need to do better to create a Minneapolis we all love."
Chauvin is the second Minnesota officer to be convicted of killing a civilian on the job. He is the first officer in Minnesota to be convicted of second-degree murder, the highest murder count prosecutors can file without convening a grand jury to review evidence.
The jury of six people of color -- two multiracial women, three Black men, a Black woman -- and six white jurors began deliberating about 4 p.m. Monday after hearing unusually long closing arguments from the prosecution and defense that totaled nearly six hours; they signed their verdicts at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday.
They were asked to decide between the prosecution's claims that Chauvin used excessive force when he knelt on Floyd's neck for about 9 Â½ minutes, and the defense's argument that Chauvin was following his training when he arrested an unruly Floyd, and that Floyd died of a cardiac arrest resulting from drug use, pre-existing heart disease and clogged arteries.
At a later date Cahill will decide whether there were aggravating factors that could merit a prison term above state sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors previously said there were five aggravating factors that should compel a stiffer sentence, including that Floyd was "particularly vulnerable" and was treated with "particular cruelty."
Second-degree unintentional murder is punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. However, Minnesota sentencing guidelines call for identical presumptive prison terms for both counts, starting at 12Â½ years for someone with no criminal history.
Second-degree manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of $20,000. The count carries a presumptive sentence of four years for someone with no criminal history.
Chauvin will be sentenced on the highest charge. Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor of law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said that if Cahill found aggravating factors and applied them to sentencing, Chauvin would receive a maximum of 30 years in prison. Without those factors, he said, Chauvin would receive 15 years maximum.
Chauvin was the fourth officer tried in Minnesota for killing a civilian on the job in the last four years. Former St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez was acquitted in 2017 for fatally shooting Philando Castile during a traffic stop. Former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was convicted in 2019 of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond while responding to her 911 call about a possible sexual assault in an alley. Washington County sheriff's deputy Brian Krook was acquitted last year for fatally shooting Benjamin Evans, who was intoxicated, suicidal and had a gun but had not threatened to harm officers.
Three other officers at the scene of Floyd's arrest -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao face trial Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All three, who also were fired, are out on bond.

THE VERDICT
Second-degree unintentional murder Did Chauvin cause George Floyd's death, without intending to cause death, while committing or attempting to commit assault? Guilty
Third-degree murder Did Chauvin cause the death of Floyd by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life? Guilty
Second-degree manslaughter Did Chauvin, by his culpable negligence, take an unreasonable risk and consciously take chances of causing death or great bodily harm to Floyd? Guilty

At square, tension yields to joy

Full text: A handful of business owners crowded before a restaurant television Tuesday, bracing for the verdict.
George Floyd died just a few yards away under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin last year, turning their neighborhood into an international beacon for racial justice and police reform. They anxiously waited to see whether Chauvin would face consequences.
"This is crazy," said Sam Willis Jr., who wore a nervous grin and paced the length of his Just Turkey restaurant. "I hope it goes well. I think he's got to get one [conviction on the charges]. He's got to go down for one. I don't see him getting acquitted."
"I think he's gonna be acquitted," said friend and nearby store owner Willie Frazier, perched on a rail and shaking his head. "They called in the National Guard, all the police up in here, boarded up the whole city. They know what's going on."
Judge Peter Cahill suddenly popped onto the screen, and a hush fell as everyone pulled out their cellphones to record the moment.
"Oh, my stomach hurts!" Willis blurted.
Then came the verdicts one by one. Second-degree murder: Guilty. Third-degree murder: Guilty. Manslaughter: Guilty.
"Ohh they gave him all three!" Willis whooped and the men high-fived. "Oh, I got the chills."
"I got hope. This happens to us so many times, I didn't want to have hope just to get let down. I'm so happy. Oh, my god," Frazier said as he walked next door to throw open his shop. Cars honked in celebration. "The town is safe. Everybody will be safe. It breaks down the tension that people have had for so long."
It's a tension that Willis, Frazier and other Black business owners near the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue have endured firsthand ever since Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes last May 25.
Now known as George Floyd Square, the area attracted visitors from all over the world. It has remained blocked off by concrete barricades, bike racks, and anti-tank defense structures maintained by a controversial group of activists demanding the city of Minneapolis meet 24 demands in return for yielding back the street.
Hundreds trickled into the square to hear and celebrate the verdict Tuesday. Some in the crowd wept and embraced.
"This is a relief," said Linda Torey, who started crying in the middle of the street. She raised her hands and yelled "History is being made!"
Into the evening, the racially mixed crowd with families and friends ballooned to around 600. A band played in the parking lot of Worldwide Outreach for Christ. Goodie bags of incense, bath salts and homemade soap were being given out as well as hand warmers.
Joi Lewis, founder of the Healing Justice Foundation, was downtown when she heard the verdict but soon made her way to George Floyd Square. She said she was relieved about the charges.
"It sets hopefully a precedent for saying you can't do this, you have to be held accountable for taking a human life. â€¦ The system has to be held accountable."
As the evening wore on, the crowd bellowed various chants, fists raised: "George Floyd!" they yelled. "Power to the people!"
People brought fresh flowers to the square. At one point, several in the crowd let out a collective scream of relief. People grilled meat as music boomed in celebration. After nightfall, people began to dance.
Alfonzo Williams of the Agape Movement, a peacekeeping group under contract with the city to provide security for the square and a beneficiary of the occupiers' demands, was jubilant as he prepared to mill around in the crowd. Williams, who grew up in the neighborhood and still attends Worldwide Outreach for Christ in the intersection, said he had mentally prepared himself for the worst when he woke up on Tuesday.
"It's a weight taken off our shoulders," he said. "It's been hard here. We've been through a lot of stuff, a lot of ups and downs. â€¦ We've made it through."
But it was just the beginning, he said. Three other officers still face trial in Floyd's killing, he pointed out. And the community had yet another case for which to seek justice in Daunte Wright, killed by a Brooklyn Center police officer in a traffic stop just over a week earlier.
Nathan McGinley, who also grew up in the neighborhood, stood with a friend apart from the crowd after hearing the verdict, weighing conflicted emotions. Chief among them: overwhelming relief.
"It's a lot. [George Floyd] could have easily been my dad, my uncle, anybody, because I grew up right here," he said. "A man's still dead. But as far as justice, it's a good day. â€¦ I'm not happy that a man's going to prison for a long time, but I'm not sad about it, either. He deserves to face consequences for his actions."
Over the heads of the crowd, someone threw handfuls of dollar bills into the air. People with signs poured down the sidewalk chanting joyfully on megaphones and drove by hanging out of car windows, pumping their fists.
Frazier, at his Finish Touch Boutique clothing and accessories store, predicted that people would be celebrating the verdict around the world.
"Now, we've got more faith here than yesterday. Everybody's got more faith. I even got more faith," he said. "There's a lot to celebrate, all over the nation. â€¦ It's a beautiful thing."

Floyd's family calls for Senate to pass namesake policing act: With verdict delivered, "I'm fighting for everyone" else now, his brother says.

Full text: George Floyd's family described Derek Chauvin's guilty verdict Tuesday as a turning point for the nation.
"Today we are able to breathe again," Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd said, as he and other family members teared up in joy and relief. But one by one, Floyd's brothers, nephew, aunt and others also told a throng of reporters that the push for police reform that Floyd's death sparked cannot end with the jury decision.
"I'm not just fighting for George anymore; I'm fighting for everyone around this world," Philonise said.
Floyd's family members called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House but has yet to clear the Senate.
His family held the post-verdict news conference at a downtown Minneapolis hotel, along with the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. Sharpton also stressed that the fight for change is not over but said, "This gives us the energy to fight on."
President Joe Biden called Floyd's family after Chauvin was found guilty, family attorney Ben Crump said. Crump said Biden talked about how, "We are all a better America today."
But, Crump noted, the president said they have to build on this moment.
Family members and attorneys repeatedly thanked the advocates who have been demanding change in Minneapolis and other cities across the world, and applauded Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office prosecuted the case against Chauvin.
Many of Floyd's loved ones emphasized the importance of the moment in the arc of history -- Philonise called Emmett Till, a boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955, "the first George Floyd" -- and stressed that they want to make the world a better place for young people, like Floyd's daughter Gianna, who was at the news conference.
But they also reflected on the man whose death triggered a national tidal wave of action.
"Every day of my life I will salute him," Terrence Floyd said of his brother, who he said showed him how to be strong, respectful and speak his mind.
"I will miss him, but now I know he's in history," he said. "What a day to be a Floyd, man."

Full text: Just after 4 p.m. Tuesday, a silence fell over the crowd of hundreds who'd gathered outside the razor wire that enclosed a heavily guarded courthouse in downtown Minneapolis. They pushed phones to their ears, trying to hear Judge Peter Cahill read the jury's verdict.
"Guilty!" they roared, all but in real time as Cahill repeated the verdict for the murder and manslaughter charges against ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. As a bailiff handcuffed Chauvin, news of convictions on all counts sent the crowd into a jubilant frenzy: cheering, waving flags, banging on bass drums, singing, hugging and marching through the streets of a downtown that had been mostly cleared out by workers at the news that a verdict had been reached.
Dominic Powell, 33, hopped on the back of a pickup truck and waved a Black Lives Matter flag. "All three! All three!" he shouted. Drivers listening to the news on their radios joined in by blasting their horns in elation.
"George Floyd isn't coming back to life, but this is the justice we were looking for," Jaqui Howard, 25, of Minneapolis, said moments after the verdict. "This is the first time where we feel like we're actually being heard."
"I'm just shaking," said her friend Prisca Diyoka, 26. "It was overwhelming all last summer, processing this. We fought for something. And we got what we fought for."
Mothers brought their young children out to witness the celebration of a historic conviction of a white man who killed an unarmed Black man while on duty.
"I just wanted them to see this," said Shamonda Lindsey, 33, standing with 10-year-old B. J., 5-year-old Noelle and 7-month-old Serenity. Chauvin "could have prevented this," Lindsey said. "It didn't have to go this far."
Yvonne Gbieor said her 18-year-old son experienced nightmares for months after Floyd was killed. "Thank God George Floyd got justice," she said.
For those who believed history would repeat itself -- that the white policeman would go free -- news of the verdict brought a strange relief. Some expressed newfound optimism in the criminal justice system, saying they never believed it worked for them.
"It sets, hopefully, a precedent for saying: You can't do this," said Joi Lewis. "You have to be held accountable for taking a human life. â€¦ The system has to be held accountable."
By 5:45 p.m., more than a thousand people were marching through the streets of downtown Minneapolis. They carried signs in memory of Daunte Wright, Philando Castile and other Black people killed by police in the Twin Cities and elsewhere.
"Now that we got justice for George Floyd, Daunte Wright is next," said Rubia Garcia, referring to the 20-year-old killed by a Brooklyn Center police officer during a traffic stop last week.
Lisa Clemons, a retired Minneapolis police sergeant and founder of A Mother's Love Initiative, said she believes it was "the right verdict."
"This is what they wanted and this is what they got," she said, "but the work still continues for strong reforms."
Chris Dixon, director of athletic diversity and inclusion for Augsburg College, said he remembered seeing the riots as a kid after Los Angeles police officers were found not guilty for beating Rodney King. In Chauvin's case, he said, the jury got it right. "I hope it's a turning point for state and national justice systems to address police violence towards Black folks," said Dixon, who is Black.
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who testified against Chauvin in the trial, released a statement commending the jury. Arradondo called for "calm, safety and peace" as the city responds to the verdict.
"We fully respect and support people's lawful exercise of their First Amendment rights," Arradondo said. "We ask for people to be peaceful and lawful in their actions. Now is the time to use our humanity to lift each other up and not tear our city down."
As the city grew dark, the crowds dispersed from downtown. Some went to Brooklyn Center to call for justice for Wright.

Full text: Jury deliberations began late Monday after three weeks of testimony culminated with closing arguments in the case of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd's death.
After nearly six hours of arguments and rebuttal, two alternates were dismissed and the jury of seven women and five men was led away by a deputy for deliberations at 4 p.m. The jury ended its day at 8 p.m. without verdicts on any of the counts and will resume Tuesday morning.
To render a verdict, the 12 will have to unanimously agree.
Prosecutors called the use of force unreasonable and excessive, saying it merited Chauvin's conviction on all three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.
"The motto of the Minneapolis Police Department is to protect with courage, to serve with compassion," said special prosecutor Steve Schleicher. "George Floyd was not a threat to anyone; he wasn't trying to hurt anyone. â€¦ Facing George Floyd that day did not require one ounce of courage, and none was shown. No courage was required."
Schleicher argued for nearly two hours that Chauvin's pinning of Floyd on the pavement at 38th and Chicago robbed the 46-year-old man of oxygen until he died as a bystander recorded the arrest on her cellphone and shared it with the
world on social media.
Defense attorney Eric Nelson focused his nearly three-hour closing arguments on two issues: the assertion that the force Chauvin used on Floyd was appropriate and that Floyd's underlying health troubles led to his death, so Chauvin isn't criminally liable.
"Did Mr. Floyd die exclusively of asphyxia or were there other contributing factors that were not the natural result of Mr. Chauvin's acts? Things that were set in motion before Mr. Chauvin ever arrived: drug ingestion, bad heart, the diseased heart, hypertension," Nelson said. "All of these things existed before Mr. Chauvin arrived."
In his 40-minute rebuttal, co-prosecutor Jerry Blackwell dismissed the defense claims about Floyd's cause of death, calling them "stories" so many times that Cahill sustained a defense objection to the word. Blackwell ended with two photos of Floyd.
"Here's what I thought was the largest departure from the evidence. â€¦ You were told, for example, that Mr. Floyd died because his heart was too big," he said, showing the familiar selfie of Floyd before pivoting to a still image from the bystander video of him facedown on the road under Chauvin's knee. "The truth of the matter is that the reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin's heart was too small."
After the jury left the room to deliberate, Judge Peter Cahill and the lawyers remained.
The judge rejected Nelson's request for a mistrial based on the comments of U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who said during a Twin Cities visit that protesters should "get more confrontational" if Chauvin is convicted of anything less than murder. Waters made the comments during protests following the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, who was fatally shot by a Brooklyn Center police officer who said she mistook her handgun for a Taser.
Cahill, however, said Nelson's concerns were legitimate: "I'll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned."
"This goes back to what I've been saying from the beginning," the judge said. "I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function."
He said the failure to do so was "abhorrent" but that it didn't prejudice the jury.
Nelson also renewed his objection to the jury not having been sequestered for the entire trial. He said pervasive publicity had reached beyond the daily news into fictional, scripted television shows. He made requests for full sequestration before and during trial, but Cahill denied them. The jury, however, is sequestered for deliberations, meaning they stay in a hotel, under security, until they reach verdicts or conclude they cannot do so.
During closing arguments, jurors again watched videos of Floyd's final moments as both the prosecution and defense summed up their cases.
Blackwell and Schleicher urged jurors to trust themselves. "This case is exactly what you saw when you saw it first," Schleicher said. "You can believe your eyes."
"Nine minutes and 29 seconds: During this time George Floyd struggled, desperate to breathe, to make enough room in his chest to breathe," he said.
Nelson disagreed at length with the prosecutors' claim that the force was unreasonable and excessive. He replayed more footage than prosecutors had used in their closing arguments, showing clips from multiple officers' body cameras.
He said the duration of Floyd's restraint must be "put in proper context" and jurors "must decide whether the officer's actions were reasonable in light of the totality of circumstances."
From the moment Chauvin arrived on the scene, there was struggle, the lawyer said. As the officers tried to put Floyd in the car, he was able to overcome them by kicking while handcuffed, Nelson said. "It's at the point that Mr. Floyd is brought to the ground, it becomes a dispute about reasonableness," Nelson said.
Blackwell had opened his rebuttal saying he wanted jurors to listen to "common sense." He said the case against Chauvin was "so simple that a child could understand it."
He singled out the testimony of 9-year-old Judeah Reynolds, who saw what Chauvin was doing to Floyd and wanted him to get up.
Blackwell dismissed the defense's claim that an "unruly mob" of bystanders had harassed and distracted Chauvin. The bystanders, most of whom testified in court, were upset because "a defenseless, helpless man" was "losing his life one breath at a time right in front of them" and there was nothing they could do except shoot video on their cellphones.
He talked about Chauvin's twisting of the police duty to protect, saying, " 'In your custody' is 'In your care.' It's not, 'In your custody, I don't care.' "
As for the defense claim that Chauvin was worried about the crowd, he told the jury the officer's face didn't show worry. "You've seen what the face of fear and worry looked like," Blackwell said, posting an image of Floyd with his hands up as he was initially approached in his vehicle by Officer Thomas Lane, who had his gun drawn.
Lane and his partner, J. Alexander Kueng, helped hold down Floyd. The two, along with Chauvin's partner, Tou Thao, who kept the crowd back, face trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin.

Chauvin jury poised to get case

Full text: Having weeks ago made their first impressions, rival attorneys in the Derek Chauvin murder trial are poised to make their final arguments to jurors Monday in Hennepin County District Court.
The lawyers in the long-running trial hope to do their best to make their words resonate as they spell out to jurors why they should acquit or convict the fired Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd late last spring.
The prosecution, carrying the burden of providing proof to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, goes first and will have
Steve Schleicher take the lead. Then comes defense attorney Eric Nelson's one shot at persuasion before Jerry Blackwell stands poised for rebuttal before jurors weigh charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
For the state, said Mitchell Hamline Law School adjunct Prof. Richard Petry, it's crucial to "go element by element through each crime [Chauvin] has been charged with, and making sure you covered everything that you need to cover."
At the same time, he cautioned, "This jury is probably tired and has heard a lot. If they are fading off, you should probably take a cue from that."
David Schultz, law professor at the University of Minnesota and at Mitchell Hamline Law School in St. Paul, agreed that jury fatigue should be taken into account. They started hearing testimony on March 29.
"You don't want to reargue the case again," Schultz said. "I don't think the jury wants to be sitting in the jury box until 3 in the afternoon" after starting at 9 a.m. Monday.
Rachel Moran, associate professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, countered that the prosecution must take all the time it needs, especially when it comes to the medical evidence put before the jury.
"I expect the state will probably be very thorough walking the jury through the medical evidence, as that was the only part of the trial that was a little harder to understand for many laypeople," she said.
On the flip side, Moran said, "the defense wants the jury to walk away confused, especially about how Mr. Floyd died. ... It may have been an overdose, or a heart attack, or exhaust from the nearby car, or really any combination of the above. The defense will emphasize that if the jury isn't certain about how Mr. Floyd died, it has to acquit."
Petry said defense attorney Nelson should avoid specifics about what happened at 38th and Chicago on May 25 or run the risk of tripping himself up.
"If you get too deep into the details, a lot of these theories don't seem to be supported by the evidence," he said. "Most defense attorneys will try to poke holes in the state's case rather than try to establish he's proven something."
Petry anticipates the defense will strongly emphasize in its final arguments the cause of Floyd's death, which Nelson has contended is a combination of cardiac arrest, previous health problems and illicit drugs. The prosecution said a lack of oxygen killed Floyd because of the length of time Chauvin spent kneeling on Floyd's neck and back.
"That's the place where Eric made the noise about," Petry said. "From his perspective, conflicting expert opinions and tests regarding cause of death. There's lack of oxygen, and others saying it was a heart attack and drugs that played a role. He's going to say these things to raise doubt."
The 12 jurors are sequestered until they have unanimous verdicts on each count. Failure to reach at least one verdict, or a hung jury, is a rarity.
Once verdicts are reached, it's the foreperson who delivers them to the court to be read before a worldwide livestream audience.
Judge Peter Cahill has said there will be at least an hour between him being notified of the verdicts and them being read in court. This will allow all necessary parties to be notified and present when the verdicts are disclosed.
The judge also said that if the jury has verdicts to return near 7 p.m., when deliberations are to wrap up each day, he will wait until the next morning to have them read. Cahill said he does not want verdicts announced after dark, when any especially large and unruly civil unrest would be more likely.
This is the fourth trial in modern times of a law enforcement officer in Minnesota being charged with killing someone and going to trial, all happening since 2017, and all reaching verdicts within a few days.
But Chauvin's trial stands alone among the four in its complicated circumstances and sheer length of testimony from more than 40 witnesses. That leaves jurors with much more material to go over, but they are under no obligation to do so.
Sequestration, being kept from loved ones and jobs, also will affect the swiftness of the jurors' decisionmaking, Moran said.
If there is a conviction on any count, Cahill can either allow Chauvin to remain free on bail or be taken into custody until sentencing. Given the seriousness of the charges, it's nearly certain that conviction would mean Chauvin's immediate detention. Former police officer Mohamed Noor was led away in handcuffs upon his conviction in April 2019 for the killing of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Not guilty on all charges, and Chauvin walks right out of the courtroom to never be tried again for the same act.
"If it happens that Derek Chauvin is acquitted, it's over," Schultz said. "The prosecution has got one shot."

Full text: Frankie Powell still remembers how George Floyd would stop by the Salvation Army Harbor Light Center to joke and catch up with old friends.
He cannot bring himself to watch too closely the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer accused of killing Floyd.
"It's very painful -- very, very, very painful," said Powell, an advocate at the center in downtown Minneapolis. "He was like part of our family here, you know?" Watching Floyd's death "play out all over again, it does something to your spirit and your soul."
The trial has prompted reflection among some staff and clients at the Harbor Light Center, Minnesota's largest homeless shelter, where Floyd worked as a security guard from 2017 to 2018 after arriving from Houston at the bus stop around the corner. Even after he left the job, Floyd was known to regularly visit old colleagues who still recall his warmth and humor. Some of his closest friends in Minneapolis at the time of his death last May worked at the shelter on Currie Avenue.
Security guard Sylvia Jackson said "it's just too much" for her and that the videos of that evening should be enough to put Chauvin away. She was one of Floyd's last friends to see him alive before Chauvin and other officers apprehended him outside Cup Foods in south Minneapolis on May 25.
She recalled that Floyd had crashed at her house, where friends had come together during the pandemic, the evening of May 24 and had been in his usual happy mood. As Jackson was leaving early the next morning for her shift at the Harbor Light Center, she talked with Floyd about having a barbecue when she returned from work that afternoon.
Floyd was supposed to pick up a barbecue grill and lighter fluid in her Mercedes-Benz, Jackson said, but when she got home he was not there. She went out for the supplies herself. Jackson called Floyd and he told her he was on his way.
He never showed up. She called him again. No answer. She texted him. No answer. The next morning, a friend woke her up and said, "There's a video of Floyd getting killed."
Months after a bystander's video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, police body camera footage depicted the moments leading up to the encounter, when police approached Floyd sitting in Jackson's blue Mercedes, drew a gun and handcuffed him on suspicion that he passed a fake $20 bill.
"This man was a father, a best friend. Everybody loved him. ... I don't understand why [Chauvin] decided to do this to him," Jackson said.
At the Harbor Light Center, "I've been seeing and hearing a lot of people talking about it," she said. People can't "help but to talk about it because of what happened and the way it happened."
Powell, too, has heard many discussions about the trial.
"I think a lot of people are on edge because they really don't want to see officer Chauvin get off for murder, and lots of people distrust the system because we have seen so many people get killed and police officers get off," he said.
Powell remembers the last conversation they had, about six months before Floyd died.
"He said, 'Frankie, I'm going through some trouble right now but I'm going to be all right,' " Powell recalled. "He asked me, 'Would you pray for me?' And I told him, 'I got you.' "
Today, he said, "My heart is heavy right now until we get justice."
Maurice Melancon, a client of the Harbor Light Center, remembered seeing Floyd around when he stayed at the shelter off and on in 2017, but didn't realize that he was the man filmed under Chauvin's knee until seeing a news report that Floyd used to work at the Salvation Army center. He learned of Floyd's death while in prison for burglary. His fellow inmates discussed it at length.
"People were amazed how long [Chauvin] sat on that man's neck and just for people to tell you what you're doing is wrong, why didn't it click in his mind at some point to stop what he was doing?" said Melancon as he smoked a cigarette on a park bench outside the Harbor Light Center.
He believed that if he or any of the other prisoners had been recorded kneeling on Floyd's neck, they would receive no mercy from the criminal justice system: "You'd be dead meat."
Melancon said he was released from prison as opening statements in the trial began last month and is now back at the shelter. When he runs errands downtown, he is heartened by the young people he sees demanding justice outside the courthouse. As a 43-year-old man of Black, Indigenous and white heritage, Melancon remembers being told that justice and equality would take time, and sees that the newer generation is not willing to wait.
"They're not backing down," he said. "They're ready."
In recent weeks, security guard Aubrey Rhodes tried to catch up on the trial when he got home from work. He could not bring himself to watch some of the graphic videos shown in court.
"It's been hard for me, just ups and downs," he said. "I've been trying to take it one day at a time, just trying to get through with this. It's just been wearing and tearing down on me."
Rhodes moved to Minneapolis from Houston in 2016 and encouraged Floyd to follow him about seven months later, greeting him at the bus stop and helping him land a job at the shelter. They remained close during Floyd's years in Minnesota. He said Floyd invited him to the barbecue at Jackson's house the afternoon he died, but Rhodes declined because he was working a double shift.
Recently, Rhodes brought several of his and Floyd's friends visiting from Texas to George Floyd Square.
"I just want justice," said Rhodes. "I know we're going to get justice."
Wallace White had followed the trial in the mornings at the south Minneapolis office of the anti-violence group MAD DADS before he would arrive at the Harbor Light Center as part of a patrol of outreach workers to ward off crime on the block. The area in front of the shelter was a top destination for police calls during Floyd's employment there, though White said Currie Avenue has quieted down since his team started working there last year.
"The thing that stuck with me was that his defense attorney was actually trying to make it seem like George was the problem, that he did it. ... That angered me," said White.
He got to know Floyd in 2017 when they both attended Turning Point, an addiction treatment center in north Minneapolis. He still thinks about the last time he saw him: Floyd visited the Harbor Light Center on May 24, and White talked to him about coming to his office the following day to sign the paperwork for a new job as an outreach worker at MAD DADS.
Floyd never showed up. On May 26, White received a call about Floyd's death.
"What if he was white, would they have did that?" he asked.
Larry Harris doesn't think so. An outreach worker who patrols the area with White, Harris also objects to how the defense is highlighting the drugs in Floyd's system. He sees plenty of people on this block use drugs, too, to numb themselves from the stresses of poverty.
"What does that have to do," Harris asked, "with you putting your knee on that man's neck?"

Full text: The livestreamed trial of ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd nears a conclusion Monday with two lawyers presenting their final, most compelling version of what happened on the street outside Cup Foods almost one year ago.
After 45 witnesses and 14 days of testimony in the Hennepin County District Court trial, special prosecutor Steve Schleicher and defense lawyer Eric Nelson will make their closing arguments, the final words the jurors hear from them before retreating behind closed doors to deliberate.
"The whole trial is about dropping the puzzle pieces in the middle of the courtroom and slowly putting them together," St. Paul criminal and civil litigator A.L. Brown said. The closing argument is "putting them together how you see it."
Mitchell Hamline School of Law Prof. Carolyn Grose said closing arguments are "where you get to say everything you've been hinting at. ... The closing is where you tell the whole story without interruption."
The prosecution, which goes first and gets a brief rebuttal by special prosecutor Jerry Blackwell after the defense, carries the bigger burden and has much more ground to cover. The prosecution's job is to convince the jury of Chauvin's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt" on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Nelson's job is to convince at least one juror that there is reasonable doubt.
Mitchell Hamline School of Law Prof. Ted Sampsell-Jones said the state's case was
methodical and emotional, and he expects the closing to match. "They will walk through the three big pillars of evidence: the video and eyewitness testimony, the use-of-force experts and the medical experts," he said.
Retired assistant Hennepin County attorney Judy Johnston, who delivered many closings in high-profile murder trials, said she always started by bringing the victim into the courtroom, projecting their image and saying, "This person should be with us today except this defendant made a series of decisions to take his life."
She would then shift into the narrative of what happened before talking about the legal elements, but she didn't want to focus solely on the law. "I wanted the jury to feel it from the victim's perspective," she said.
In a 1995 Hennepin County case, the victim was 3-year-old Adrian Brasch, whose stepfather slashed his skull and face with a knife. Johnston won a conviction after she explained in closing that defensive wounds on the boy's hands indicated Adrian had crouched in a corner and held up his hands to fight off his attacker.
In closings, both sides can use any evidence from the trial. In their case against Chauvin, the prosecutors have shown extensive video from surveillance cameras, police body-worn cameras and the footage -- seen worldwide -- shot by teenager Darnella Frazier from the sidewalk on her cellphone.
Three weeks ago in his opening statement, Blackwell previewed Chauvin's videotaped response to Floyd's pleas.
"You will see that he does not let up and that he does not get up," Blackwell said.
Brown expects the video to be shown in the state's closings.
"The most powerful piece of evidence will be that video," Brown said. "There were protests across the country and across the world because of the video."
University of Minnesota law Prof. Jon Lee said the video also helps the state underscore an element of the crimes -- that Chauvin knowingly using force on Floyd. "It will evoke a reaction in jurors," Lee said. "You want to create a compelling picture. You want them to have the feeling that they have to convict this person."
Sampsell-Jones said the state will make an emotional appeal, arguing that Floyd "was a human, and how he did not deserve this treatment -- and how Chauvin's conduct was outrageous and wholly unjustified."
But the prosecution can't rely on emotion alone. It has to talk about the law and define the terms.
Prosecutors will say that Chauvin caused Floyd's death while assaulting him and is guilty of second-degree murder. They will say he's guilty of third-degree murder because he caused Floyd's death while perpetrating an eminently dangerous act on Floyd.
There's no time limit, but the prosecution has to be careful not to go on too long. "If you kind of suggest this case is more complicated by doing that, there's some risk," retired Hennepin County Judge Kevin Burke said.
Brown said prosecutors have a tendency to revisit every detail.
"This is a time to argue, not recite," he said. "Explain why you brought the damn case in the first place."
For most of the jurors, this is probably their first case, and "they want the 'Law & Order'-type closing," he said, referring to the television show. "And as much as you can, you ought to give it to them. ... For crying out loud, give them a little drama, a little passion."
The defense attorney's job in the closing is much more focused.
"You try to isolate one or two issues and argue the evidence on those issues and make the claim they haven't proved it," longtime Minnesota defense lawyer Joe Friedberg said.
Brown said a defense lawyer wants jurors to think, "Something's off," or "the defendant, I don't particularly like him, but something's not adding up."
In this case, Friedberg said he'd argue that testimony and evidence failed to show Floyd's blood flow or airway was compromised so Chauvin's force didn't cause his death. He said he'd argue that the excited crowd was a distraction and Chauvin had no idea Floyd had died.
Bradford Colbert, who teaches at Mitchell Hamline and is a part-time public defender, agreed the defense is likely to argue that Chauvin wasn't indifferent to Floyd but was distracted.
Colbert and Lee expect Nelson to argue there's reasonable doubt about what killed Floyd.
"All he will need to show is there was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt on that particular element," Lee said, adding that if Chauvin didn't cause Floyd's death, "you can't convict."
To reach a verdict of guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors need to agree on a charge. One dissenting juror can result in a hung jury.
So while a global audience looks in on the closings via livestream, the lawyers will be speaking to an audience not visible to anyone outside the courtroom.
"The whole world is watching," Grose said. "But the whole world is not deciding."

Key testimony from Week Three
The third week of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin included 11 witnesses, three called by the prosecution and eight called by the defense. The week included testimony from use-of-force experts, George Floyd's younger brother and a Minneapolis Park Police officer.
"People would attend church just because he was there. ... He just knew how to make people feel better."
Philonise Floyd, on his brother's impact on their community in Texas
"I believe Mr. Floyd's death was absolutely preventable."
Dr. Jonathan Rich, a cardiologist and medical expert from Chicago, testified that Floyd's death was attributable to low oxygen levels.
"I would fall back to undetermined in this case."
Dr. David Fowler, former chief medical examiner for Maryland, said there were "conflicting manners" concerning Floyd's death.
"I felt that Derek Chauvin was justifi ed and acting with objective reasonableness."
Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert who served for 22 years in the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Police Department, testified for the defense
"The man had a gun at the window. [Floyd] grabbed the wheel, and he said, 'Please, please don't shoot me.' "
Shawanda Hill, who was in the car with Floyd on May 25. She testified that Floyd said "he was tired because he had been working."
"The passenger was unresponsive and noncompliant to my commands. I then had to physically reach in. ... In my mind his behavior was very nervous."

Suburb is diverse, police force isn't

Full text: The 47 officers who make up the Brooklyn Center Police Department have little in common with the nearly 31,000 people they serve.
Most officers are white, while most residents are people of color. Nearly all officers are male, while the city is mostly female. And, according to Mayor Mike Elliott -- who in 2019 became the first person of color to lead the city -- not one officer lives within city limits.
Brooklyn Center in recent decades has transformed from a mostly white suburb into what is now one of the most diverse cities in Minnesota, while its police force has remained largely unchanged.
Though city officials have repeatedly pledged major police reforms -- and created a nationally recognized model for other cities -- the killing of an unarmed 20-year-old Black man, Daunte Wright, by a white officer has put the suburban department under a national microscope and attracted new criticism about whether reform is possible when there is such a disconnect between police and the community.
"It's performative community building, it's performative justice," said community organizer Toussaint Morrison. "If you're going to start reforming, you have to take out the pieces that are already guilty of taking Black lives."
The skepticism over police reform efforts was already heightened after the death of George Floyd last year, with calls nationwide -- including by some elected officials -- to defund or eliminate police altogether.
"The types of reforms that take away police power and shrink their budgets are the only kind of thing that's ever going to result in a reduction in the violence that they perpetrate," said Alec Karakatsanis, founder and executive director of Washington D.C.-based Civil Rights Corps.
Wright is the sixth person killed by Brooklyn Center police since 2012. All but one of them were men of color.
Police Department demographic data, obtained through a public records request, show the department includes 11 officers of color -- less than a quarter of the force. Of those officers, three are Black, two are Hispanic, five are Asian and one is "two or more races."
Police Department officials could not be reached for comment.
Kimberly Potter, the former Brooklyn Center police officer charged with second-degree manslaughter in Wright's killing, was one of seven female officers in the department, all of whom are white, according to the data.
Potter, a 26-year veteran of the department who most recently lived in Champlin, shot Wright during a traffic stop last Sunday. Police said Potter mistakenly fired her gun instead of a Taser.
Efforts at reform
In 2005, Brooklyn Center and neighboring Brooklyn Park adopted partnerships between police and diverse populations to build trust, and that nationally recognized collaboration spread to five departments throughout the Twin Cities and Hennepin County.
Brooklyn Center police leaned into that community partnership to share information and create a "calming period" at the onset of the investigation following the fatal police shooting in 2019 of 21-year-old Kobe Dimock-Heisler, Police Cmdr. Rick Gabler told the Star Tribune last summer.
"We just didn't see the response that you saw in Minneapolis with George Floyd," Gabler said. "Some of it can be attributed to the fact that we have these relationships with the community that already exist."
Dimock-Heisler's family waited 11 months to view body camera footage from the shooting, and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman declined to file charges against the two officers involved. One, Cody Turner, still serves in the department, according to city clerk Barb Suciu.
After Wright's killing, authorities released bodycam footage within a day and charges were filed. Potter and Police Chief Tim Gannon, who took the top job in 2015 after 22 years as an officer with the department, both resigned.
Meanwhile, Elliott and the City Council made rapid policy and staffing changes, including firing the city manager, giving the mayor's office power over the Police Department and passing a resolution prohibiting officers from using a variety of nonlethal weapons on protesters.
State Sen. Chris Eaton, DFL-Brooklyn Center, and her husband, former Mayor Tim Willson, live a half-dozen blocks from the police station where protests have unfolded nightly after Wright's killing.
Though Eaton said she believes police may have unconscious racial biases, she does not believe they start each day intent on acting on them.
"I've always had the greatest respect for and work closely with our Police Department," she said, adding that she's been friends with the past three police chiefs. "They are a bunch of dedicated young men and women, and people make mistakes."
Elliott, who defeated Willson in 2018, has been an outspoken advocate for racial equity and police reform. In response to Dimock-Heisler's shooting, he took to social media to suggest possible changes to the police department including more de-escalation training, pairing officers with social workers and hiring officers who live in the community.
Whether the mayor will be able to accomplish such changes remains to be seen.
"Elliott is somewhat of an outsider," said Erwin Heisler, Dimock-Heisler's grandfather. "He's a young, Black man and you know this City Council and the Police Department are old white men."
Heisler said he doesn't think race was a factor in his grandson's killing, but he questions the split-second decision by officers to switch from Tasers to guns.
"If I thought there was one chance in 1,000 that they would have shot him and killed him, I wouldn't have called 911," he said.
Heightened scrutiny
Amid the efforts at reform, the Brooklyn Center Police Department -- which in 2020 accounted for 40% of the city's budget -- has faced misconduct investigations and paid out hefty settlements.
The department was investigated at least 88 times for alleged officer misconduct and department policy violations from 2016 through 2020 -- more than most law enforcement agencies in the state over that time period. Of those cases, department employees were exonerated about a third of the time, while nearly 40% were deemed to lack conclusive evidence, according to data obtained from the Minnesota Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Board.
The department had eight police misconduct payouts from 2007 to 2018, two of which were among the most expensive police payouts in the state during that time, according to a Star Tribune analysis including data from the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust.
Now, the department is facing heightened scrutiny, much as the Minneapolis Police Department did after Floyd's death.
Eight days after Floyd's death, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department. It also launched an investigation into whether the agency had discriminated against people of color over the past decade. That investigation is ongoing.
On Friday, the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN) called for the state to take similar action against the Brooklyn Center Police Department.
In a statement, CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein called an investigation "a necessary step toward repairing broken systems and to rebuild the relationships between the community and those who serve them."

Full text: Special to the Star Tribune
When Dr. Dionne Hart was considering medical school, her high school adviser suggested she choose something more "suitable." Fortunately, she ignored the advice. Hart, who was "always curious about brain disorders," is among a tiny group of Black women psychiatrists. An adjunct assistant professor at the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine and Science, she is also the first and only Black woman to be elected to the Minnesota Medical Association's board of trustees. Hart spoke recently on a panel of women psychiatrists sponsored by NAMI Minnesota. She expands below on mental health challenges for a Black community reeling from COVID-19 and the killing of George Floyd.
Q: Even when you had a medical school acceptance letter, people tried to discourage you. Why was that?
A: I had my first child at 17 and welcomed my other two children during my second and third years of college. I married at 18 and I left an abusive relationship at 20. I think some people were genuinely scared and worried that I would be disappointed. When I think of my experience in medical school, it was as if I was standing inside a tornado. Everything was still. From my viewpoint, I could not fully appreciate all of the changes and chaos happening around me because I was so focused on my goals. My denial protected me from being overwhelmed by the challenges I faced.
Q: You must have channeled your deeply proud father, too. You have a lovely story about him.
A: My father was born in 1920. He never spoke about medical school dreams as his own, but rather dreams he had for me. After his older brother died in World War II, he was expected to help the family financially. After he passed away at 79, I found a dissection kit that he kept in a drawer. It's now in my home office.
Q: The American Psychiatric Association (APA) reports that only 2% of psychiatrists are Black. How do we increase those numbers?
A: I initiated a Minnesota Medical Association (MMA) sponsored screening of the Black Men in While Coats film and a discussion of the project (blackmeninwhitecoats.org) with organizers and multiple Black male leaders in medicine. Role models are absent. STEM careers are not encouraged. I was a top student in my class at a private Catholic college prep school but I was never encouraged to go to medical school or even asked about my career goals. I remember my counselor discouraging me from applying to the University of Chicago and then suggesting that I apply to "more suitable" schools.
Q: I think psychiatry has always suffered a bit in terms of respect and understanding. Do you see skepticism in the Black community?
A: It remains true. In the media, psychiatrists are often portrayed as pill pushers having inappropriate relationships with patients, and "head shrinkers." In the Black community, we do not even exist. I recently lost a relative to suicide and it was difficult for many to say the word or even discuss the necessity of mental health treatment. Growing up, there were many excuses and reasons not to seek mental health treatment, such as God does not give you anything you cannot handle; suffering makes you stronger. And, therapy is for white people. When Black patients mention their worries about getting mental health treatment, I remind them that just because you go to therapy doesn't mean you cannot still pray. Prayer has no side effects. I feel medication and science, in general, are often the way God answers our prayers for healing.
Q: I imagine many patients are delighted when you walk into the room.
A: Many times at Hennepin Healthcare, older Black patients will mention how proud they are that I am a doctor. Often, Black women will be relieved that there are issues they do not have to explain or fear that I will judge them.
Q: Conversely, do you think some people won't see you because you're female, or Black?
A: I'm on staff at multiple sites and it is sadly too common for both white and Black patients to refuse to speak with me because of my race. It is not just my professional pedigree that is questioned, but even my identity as a Black American woman. I regularly encounter patients who have had very little exposure to Black people. The first few minutes is not related to their issues, but personal questions about my life. A very common question is, "Where are you from?" My answer: "Chicago." Then, "No, where did you live before Chicago?" My response: "My mother's womb, which is also located in Chicago." Minorities regularly develop funny comebacks or other strategies to defuse these uncomfortable situations and cope with racism and microaggressions.
Q: That judging must feel exhausting.
A: Malcolm X once said, "The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman." Sadly, it's still true, particularly over the past four years when Black women felt targeted by the former president.
Q: This must be why you advocate to get more women of color into professional leadership roles.
A: One of my mentors, child psychiatrist Dr. Patrice Harris, was the first Black woman to serve as American Medical Association president. She said that at the start of every meeting you should look around the table and think about who is missing. We are a diverse society with different needs and experience. It is important that women are in leadership roles and C-suites to make certain that policies and decisions fit the needs of all patients.
Q: COVID-19 has revealed huge gaps in mental health services among communities of color. Can you say more about "the minority tax?"
A: These are the extra responsibilities placed on minority faculty to achieve diversity or address issues related to minorities. During the past year, I have been asked to volunteer more often, and I was very busy before the pandemic. But the issues of social justice, the disparities in the morbidity of COVID-19, and access to the COVID-19 vaccine are important to me. The tax has, at the very least, doubled in the last year.
Q: We must acknowledge George Floyd's killing, which left you traumatized personally but more focused professionally. Please say more.
A: For weeks after the murder of George Floyd, I could not sleep. I worried about my sons in particular. My family home is a block from our neighborhood police station. I grew up seeing police officers as protectors and now my heart races when I hear sirens. I am incredibly frustrated because the majority of police officers are dedicated public officials, yet they remain silent when these senseless crimes occur. There is a necessary spotlight on police brutality and Black people, but it is a fact that 1 in 5 people shot and killed by police have a mental illness.
Q: What are possible solutions?
A: Specialized mental health units should respond to mental health calls. We would never hand a weapon to someone in a mental health crisis, so why introduce an armed individual into a mental health crisis? Police officers have been tasked with performing too many duties that are a mismatch to their expertise and training. It is a disservice to these public servants and the public. I have used my small platform for change, not in defunding, but in reform. I have hope because I won't accept the alternative.
Q: How has the community shown resiliency?
A: Through campaigns to support Black businesses and the allyship of men and women who recognize systemic racism.

Full text: A billboard promoting nonviolence at the site of George Floyd's death has been transformed by vandals into a pro-violence message.
Designed by Minneapolis artist Xavier Tavera, the billboard at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue shows a tear-gas canister used by police during protests last spring with the words "Don't let anyone convince you that non-violence is ineffective."
Someone this week covered up the "non-."
Tavera learned of the vandalism after a photo was posted Wednesday on the George Floyd Square Instagram account (@38thandChicagoGFS), which has more than 13,000 followers. The post seems to interpret the billboard as pro-police, joking that the vandals should be brought "to swift justice for their crimes at the next morning meeting where they should be served a minimum one coffee and doughnut."
"Violence is effective," the post continues. "Police violence has predicated some of the most massive protests in history. When the police commit violence against protestors, it is effective in escalating situations, enflaming tensions, and convincing people they need to take a stand."
Commenters on the post chimed in, with one calling the artist "a cop sympathizer." Tavera, who identifies as Latino, joined the discussion to defend himself as a person of color, writing: "I am for peace. Look at it closer. It doesn't matter what violence the police inflicts on us we can stand our ground and protest peacefully."
The billboard went up as part of NE Sculpture Gallery Factory's ongoing Social Justice Billboard Project, which intends to elevate voices of artists of color. Two other billboards also went up recently at 38th and Chicago, by Twin Cities artists Seitu Jones and Jim Denomie.
The "cop sympathizer" comment was based on an Instagram post Tavera made in April 2020, before the killing of Floyd. Tavera posted a photo from his neighbor's daughter's birthday party, showing a young girl posed in front of a squad car with two white female cops. "She had mentioned that she wants to be a policewoman when she grows up," he wrote, and the surprise visit felt special.
Tavera said Thursday that he expected the billboard to be controversial, and it became more so after Daunte Wright was killed by police Sunday.
A photographer whose work focuses on the Latino community and issues of identity and race, Tavera said that "we are also profiled," noting the recent killing of a Latino teenager by Chicago police. But he is interested in the debate his billboard spurred and isn't sure whether he will restore its original wording.
"Most of the work I do is to spark conversation and dialogue," but he said "both the extreme right and the extreme left are ... completely missing the point" of his billboard, which is intended to support resistance to police violence. "To completely block the dialogue -- that is kind of sad but also interesting to observe."
Earlier this year, a mural painted on the side of Cup Foods where Floyd was killed garnered similar controversy. The mural was created by a small team of non-Black artists without input from Black artists or the community. The mural has been defaced multiple times, but it continues to be preserved by the caretakers of the Floyd memorial.
Last summer, activists ripped down and destroyed a mural painted on the front of Kmart on Lake Street by a white woman, portraying a white-looking cop hugging a Black protester.

Full text: A tear-gas canister, labeled "Don't let anyone convince you that nonviolence is ineffective." George Floyd's face in blue, surrounded by "re" words ("repair, resolve, remake"). An imaginary scene from the Yellow Brick Road with this text, inspired by a sign carried by protesters last year: "All Mothers Were Summoned When George Floyd Called Out for His Momma." Three billboards, designed by Twin Cities artists Xavier Tavera, Seitu Jones and Jim Denomie, now hover over the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd's life was cut short. At an unveiling Sunday, Tavera said he picked up the canister during protests the night after Floyd's death. He hopes his billboard "brings the message to people that no matter what they throw at us, we can keep the peace, we can have heated discussions about issues, and we can disagree, all nonviolently." The billboards are part of the Social Justice Billboard Project initiated by NE Sculpture Gallery Factory. Its director, John Hock, said Clear Channel offered a significant discount on the billboards, but joked that they required a few changes. He pointed to Denomie's billboard, a painting titled "Toppled Monuments": A nude woman has stars over her breasts and the text on a kid's shirt looks slightly off. "They made us put stars over Jim's ladies," he said. "And the kid with the T-shirt that says 'hit' -- well, it didn't used to say that. It's missing a letter."

Koo Koo news
Here are three names you'd never have foreseen together in a new-album announcement -- family-friendly Twin Cities duo Koo Koo Kanga Roo, Los Angeles indie-rapper Murs and UNICEF. All three are part of the rollout for Koo Koo's record "Slow Clap," due May 21 and picking up steam with this week's release of the summer-yearning single "Ice Cold Lemonade." The song features Murs spitting lemony verses alongside Koo Koo gurus Bryan Atchison and Neil Olstad. Well known locally for his collaborations with Slug as the lovelorn duo Felt, Murs also appears in the tune's fun "dance-a-long" music video, which includes an easy-to-follow routine that kids should have down pat by the time the Koo Koo crew starts performing again this summer or fall. The duo is also teaming with UNICEF to entertain pandemic-stymied children. They released the video for another sugary song from the new album, "Sticky Icky," in conjunction with the UNICEF Kid Power program, which is hosting a contest for educators that includes a grand-prize video appearance by the duo. Now available for pre-order via kookookangaroo.com, "Slow Clap" was produced with Minneapolis beatmaker and superdad Lazerbeak.

Unlocking Prince
For Prince devotees, Sunday's "60 Minutes" story about his estate and the legendary vault at Paisley Park offered a nice preview of his unearthed "Welcome 2 America" album but few revelations. More was divulged in a bonus clip at CBS.com, including a story about a 1994 David Letterman performance where Prince avoided shaking hands with the host by pretending to be shot and dragged offstage by his bodyguard at song's end. Turns out, Prince came up with the idea on the fly because Letterman was poking fun at the symbol he used as a moniker at the time. "[Prince] was hot as a cayenne pepper," keyboardist Morris Hayes recounted. The televised piece had a funny, Prince-was-human-too revelation about the "pre-vault" -- the unlocked room outside his heavily secured vault that had also become loaded with boxes of recordings. Troy Carter, the music-biz vet who now manages the estate, said, "I thought there was gonna be this story about how he left behind his old materials to focus on new artistic endeavors. And they said, 'No, he just forgot the password to the vault.' "

Quilts with a message
The Textile Center in Minneapolis is wrapping up a yearlong series of quilting exhibitions launched in response to the death of George Floyd. Open by appointment, "Racism: In the Face of Hate We Resist," a juried show featuring 63 handmade quilts, is viewable by appointment through June 12. Curator Carolyn Mazloomi, founder of the Women of Color Quilters' Network, also partnered with the Textile Center on an accompanying 200-page book, "We Are the Story," that will be available in late May to coincide with the anniversary of Floyd's death. "I was shaken," Mazloomi told the Star Tribune last fall when the first show -- now running at Studio 106 in Burnsville -- opened at the Textile Center. "It was very unnerving. I think any woman who is a mother would be called to do something." For more info, see textilecentermn.org.

Full text: Testimony in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ended Thursday with Chauvin invoking his constitutional right not to testify and a prosecution expert briefly taking the witness stand. Jurors are likely to begin deliberating Monday.
Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday, moving the trial into its seventh week. Jurors will be immediately sequestered for deliberations as they consider the charges facing Chauvin in the May 25 death of George Floyd -- second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
"I will invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege today," Chauvin told the court Thursday morning. The Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination.
Chauvin's brief remarks in response to questions from his attorney, Eric Nelson, and Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill were the most he's spoken publicly since kneeling on Floyd's neck for about 9 Â½ minutes last year when arresting him for using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes.
Chauvin took off a blue surgical face mask, mandated by the courts for COVID-19 protection, and spoke into a microphone in his hand. Jurors were not present for the discussion.
Nelson reminded Chauvin that "the state would have broad latitude" to cross-examine him as a witness if he testified. Nelson and Chauvin told the court they had "repeatedly" discussed whether to testify.
"We have gone back and forth on the matter would be kind of an understatement, right?" Nelson asked Chauvin.
"Yes, it is," Chauvin said with a small hint of a smile.
Nelson asked Chauvin if they had a "lengthy" meeting Wednesday night about testifying that led to "further discussion."
"Correct," Chauvin said, adding that he would not testify.
"The decision whether or not to testify is entirely yours," Cahill told Chauvin after his discussion with Nelson. "In other words, it's a personal right. â€¦ Is this your decision not to testify?"
"It is, your honor," Chauvin said.
The judge asked if he had any questions. He said no. The judge asked if anyone had made promises or threats to influence his decision.
"No promises or threats, your honor," Chauvin said.
Cahill asked Chauvin if he wanted jurors to receive a special instruction on the issue, which is offered by the courts when defendants choose not to testify. Chauvin said yes.
"The state must convince you by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged," according to the instruction Cahill recited Thursday. "The defendant has no obligation to prove innocence. The defendant has the right not to testify. This right is guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. You should not draw any inference from the fact the defendant has not testified in this case."
The defense officially rested its case several minutes later with jurors in attendance. Nelson called seven witnesses between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Arthur Reed, one of Floyd's cousins, watched the proceeding from the lone seat in the courtroom designated for a Floyd family representative. COVID-19 safety protocols have severely limited the number of attendees. A woman sat in a seat Thursday reserved for Chauvin's supporters. She declined to identify herself to a reporter.
Asked outside the courtroom about Chauvin's decision not to testify, Reed said he believed the prosecution "would have chopped him down second by second" were he asked why he remained on Floyd for more than nine minutes.
"We didn't think they were going to put him on at all," Reed said. "We're just ready to get this over with, make sure [Floyd] gets the justice he deserves. We think the state has put on an excellent case."
Chauvin is the fourth officer in Minnesota to be tried for killing a civilian on the job and is the only one who has not testified at his trial.
Officers Jeronimo Yanez and Mohamed Noor and deputy Brian Krook testified when they were tried. Yanez and Krook were acquitted. Noor was convicted.
Prosecutor Matthew Frank later said the state objected to jurors receiving the instruction Cahill recited about Chauvin not testifying, which would be given to them next week after closing arguments. The issue will be resolved when instructions are finalized.
Prosecutors recalled their pulmonologist and critical care expert, Dr. Martin Tobin, to the witness stand Thursday morning to rebut testimony Wednesday from defense witness, pathologist Dr. David Fowler.
Fowler, who recently retired after 17 years as the chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland, testified that Floyd died of cardiac arrest combined with drug use. The prosecution's witnesses previously testified that Floyd died of low oxygen as Chauvin and two other officers pressed him stomach-down in the street.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office ruled Floyd's cause of death "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." It also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were also found in Floyd's system.
Fowler had also testified that carbon monoxide from a nearby squad car, which was a hybrid vehicle, was "another brick in the wall" contributing to Floyd's death.
Tobin testified Thursday that he disagreed with Fowler's contention that Floyd's blood could have contained anywhere from 10 to 18% of the poisonous gas.
Autopsy results showed Floyd's blood had an oxygen saturation level of 98%, meaning, "all there was for anything else was 2%," Tobin said, adding that humans typically have anywhere from 0 to 3% of carbon monoxide in their blood at any given moment.
Before Tobin took the stand, prosecutors told the court they were contacted by Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker Wednesday following Fowler's testimony and were made aware of test results that specifically measured the carbon monoxide in Floyd's blood. Prosecutors asked to introduce the evidence in court Thursday through Tobin's rebuttal.
Nelson objected, arguing that Fowler had shared his report with prosecutors in February and had noted he would testify about carbon monoxide, yet prosecutors failed to react until now.
"All of this they had ample time to do, but they're doing it in the middle of trial," said Nelson, who described the prosecution's move as "incredibly prejudicial to the defense."
Fowler was on a plane and could not be reached about the sudden development, Nelson told the court.
Cahill ruled that Tobin could testify about how carbon monoxide could have affected Floyd, but could not mention the test results. "If he even hints at test results the jury has not heard about, it's going to be a mistrial, pure and simple," the judge said. "This late disclosure is not the way we should be operating here."
The judge said although he found the late disclosure "odd," he did not believe the prosecution was acting with ill intent.
Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell said they had broader, previously disclosed blood test results that Tobin would cite.
At the close of Tobin's rebuttal, Cahill told jurors to bring luggage to court Monday in preparation for their sequestration, during which they will be in a hotel and prohibited from returning home.
"If I were you, I would plan for long and hope for short. â€¦ Whether it's an hour or a week, it's entirely in your province," Cahill said.
Two former Minneapolis police officers who helped restrain Floyd, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, and a third who kept angry bystanders at bay, Tou Thao, are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.

Full text: A pathologist testifying for the defense in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin told the court Wednesday that George Floyd died of a cardiac arrest combined with drug use, and not low oxygen as several prosecution witnesses have claimed.
Dr. David Fowler also testified that the manner of death was "undetermined" due to a combination of factors, including police restraint and carbon monoxide from a nearby squad car, that could point in multiple directions. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office ruled last year that the manner of death was homicide, an act caused by another person.
"Any of the sounds Mr. Floyd is making requires you to take air in â€¦ and out â€¦," Fowler said of bystander and police body camera videos showing Floyd pleading to breathe as three officers restrained him. "You cannot make sound unless you're â€¦ moving air and your mouth is open."
Fowler testified on the second day of the defense's case, which is expected to wrap up Thursday. It's unknown whether Chauvin will testify. Closing arguments are scheduled for next Monday, with court breaking on Friday if no additional witnesses are called.
Fowler, who recently retired after 17 years as the chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland, marked the defense's move into the cause of death phase of its case. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd likely died last May 25 of a drug overdose and pre-existing issues, including heart disease and arteries that were clogged 75% and 90% in places.
Prosecutors have argued that Chauvin cut off Floyd's air supply when he knelt on his neck as Floyd lay handcuffed stomach-down in the street with former officer J. Alexander Kueng kneeling on his buttocks and thigh area and former officer Thomas Lane kneeling and holding onto his legs.
Chauvin is on trial for second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
A lack of oxygen would impact the brain first, causing someone to become disoriented and speak incoherently, Fowler said.
"Mr. Floyd goes from making clear statements â€¦ and then there's a period of about forty-five seconds of silence but he's still moving â€¦ and there's a sudden relaxation" more consistent with cardiac arrest, he testified.
Fowler inadvertently opened the door for a surprising line of impromptu questioning by prosecutor Jerry Blackwell when he testified under cross-examination that Floyd experienced a "sudden cardiac arrest" and that death was not instantaneous. The moment came about after Blackwell asked him twice about his testimony on "sudden death" while being questioned by Nelson. Fowler denied using the phrase, and in doing so, introduced the time gap between cardiac arrest and death.
"Are you suggesting that though Mr. Floyd may have been in cardiac arrest there was a time when he may have been revived because he wasn't dead yet?" asked Blackwell.
"Immediate medical attention â€¦ may well reverse that process, yes," Fowler answered.
"Do you feel that Mr. Floyd should have been given immediate emergency attention to try to reverse cardiac arrest?" Blackwell asked.
"As a physician I would agree," Fowler said.
"Are you critical of the fact that he wasn't given immediate emergency care when he went into cardiac arrest?" Blackwell asked.
"As a physician I would agree," Fowler said.
Prosecutors previously told jurors that Chauvin knelt on Floyd and did not relent even though Floyd was breathless and pulseless for nearly five minutes of the approximately 9 Â½-minute restraint.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office ruled Floyd's cause of death "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." It also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were also found in Floyd's system.
At the outset of his testimony, Fowler said Floyd had a cardiac arrhythmia due to his heart disease. The doctor listed Floyd's drug use and paraganglioma, tumors that can secrete adrenaline into the body and raise blood pressure and heart rate, as factors that played a significant role.
"All of those combined to cause Mr. Floyd's death," Fowler said.
He also said Floyd's exposure to carbon monoxide from a nearby squad's exhaust contributed by reducing his oxygen-carrying capacity.
"This is just another potential insult, another brick in the wall" in the cause of death, Fowler testified.
Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker previously testified at trial that the paraganglioma in Floyd's abdomen did not play a role in his death. Nelson told jurors in his opening statement that the tumor increases the flow of adrenaline and was a factor.
Fowler said his review of Floyd's case was subjected to the scrutiny of 13 members of the Forensic Panel. Seven forensic pathologists performed a peer review, along with specialists in behavioral health, pulmonology, emergency medicine and toxicology, he said.
Fowler testified that Chauvin was likely transferring about 30 to 35 pounds of his 140-pound body weight onto Floyd, and that it was not enough pressure to leave any bruises on Floyd's neck or upper back, according to Baker's autopsy.
"All of [Floyd's] injuries were in the areas where [Chauvin's] knee was not," Fowler said.
Fowler testified that prone restraint was not as dangerous as prosecution witnesses have claimed, and that one study called it an "interesting hypothesis" unsupported by data.
"The prone position itself does not have â€¦ or there is no evidence right now that it's a significant condition," Fowler said, noting that it is used to improve oxygen intake for some COVID-19 patients.
Fowler said there were "conflicting manners" concerning Floyd's death. "Restrained in a very stressful situation" would be homicide, he said. Ingesting drugs would be accidental, and there were the natural causes of Floyd's heart problems and other health challenges, he said.
Therefore, Fowler said, "I would fall back to undetermined in this particular case."
Blackwell suggested that Fowler tried to confuse jurors and asked him several clarifying questions, getting Fowler to confirm that he has never seen any test results showing that Floyd was injured by carbon monoxide, and that the squad car was a hybrid, which operates with both an electric motor and gasoline engine. Fowler also acknowledged under cross-examination that he is not a toxicologist or cardiologist, has not measured anyone's breathing and does not treat living patients.
"Do you agree, Dr. Fowler, that the majority of cases where somebody dies of asphyxiation are very similar and no traumatic manifestations are visible at all?" Blackwell asked.
"That is correct, depending on the circumstances," Fowler said.
Fowler's testimony comes as he and several others face a lawsuit filed in federal court by the family of Anton Black, a young Black man who died in police custody in 2018 in Maryland.
The suit, which did not come up at Chauvin's trial, alleges that Black's death was caused by officers' excessive use of force and that Fowler and other public officials covered up for the officers. The suit contends that Fowler unnecessarily delayed the release of autopsy results and was unethically influenced by police. No one was charged in Black's death.
"Two years before George Floyd died after being restrained and pinned down by police, 19-year-old Anton Black â€¦ was killed by three white law enforcement officials and a white civilian in a chillingly similar manner on Maryland's Eastern Shore," the suit reads, according to the Washington Post.
Kueng, Lane and former officer Tou Thao, who kept angry bystanders at bay, are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death.
All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.

Full text: One of the most vocal Timberwolves when it comes to issues of systemic racism and police brutality has been third-year guard Josh Okogie.
Okogie attended a downtown rally with center Karl-Anthony Towns after the death of George Floyd last May, has given interviews on the subject, appeared in a YouTube series for the Wolves discussing the issues and used his social media presence to amplify his voice.
Okogie posted a picture of himself with a T-shirt that read "Stop killing Black people" in response to the police killing of Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center on Sunday.
Following Tuesday's 127-97 loss to the Nets, Okogie again spoke passionately about his emotions in the wake of Wright's killing with the trial of Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd happening at the same time in downtown Minneapolis.
"I don't want this to go where it's like â€¦ 'We're going to say let's hold people accountable,' then we'll wait until this dies down, then everybody is going to forget about it," Okogie said. "We have to keep having this conversation. Because it's happening too frequently that a young, 20-year-old kid gets killed not too far from where they're having a trial for another Black man getting killed."
Okogie discussed the specifics of the Wright incident, in which officer Kimberly Potter was seen in body camera footage saying she shot Wright. Potter resigned from the Brooklyn Center force Tuesday, as did Police Chief Tim Gannon, who said he thought Potter accidentally pulled her gun when she meant to pull her Taser.
"Even that just shows you have subconsciously, when they see a Black kid, it's just they're automatically a threat," Okogie said.
Okogie spoke for nearly 13 minutes. He referenced a Chris Rock comedy routine in which Rock talks about having "bad apples" in certain jobs, referring to a defense of police after killings such as Wright's that most are good officers save for a few "bad apples."
"Every time I see that, I think of that script Chris Rock wrote," Okogie said. "Say I'm starting an airline business -- J.O. Airlines. Come fly with J.O. Airlines, and I say, 'OK, look, all of our pilots are pretty good, but we've got some bad apples.' Would you buy a ticket to J.O. Airlines? Probably not, right?"
Okogie said he has done extensive research when it comes to police procedures and statistics of civilians getting killed in police custody so as to better inform his view, and said he wished police had handled the encounter with Wright differently, that even if he did attempt to evade police, that doesn't justify that fact Wright is dead now.
"It's really so sad," Okogie said. "It's heartbreaking that it happens in the community that I'm playing in, because it could be anybody. I'm not far removed from it. I have a family -- little brother, older brothers, older sister -- they're not far removed from it, and it's just sickening, it's sad, it's disgusting, and it just has to stop."

For many already reeling, a redoubled trauma

Full text: Backed against her Brooklyn Center apartment building with a group of neighbors, Endeshia Tolliver watched warily as a line of riot police launched less-lethal projectiles at protesters darting between trees.
Tolliver, a special education assistant at Patrick Henry High School in north Minneapolis, has lived in the neighborhood for 14 years. She has made it a point to get to know the police, who are headquartered next door, and she trained her teenage son on how to survive a traffic stop as soon as he learned to drive.
The death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, killed by Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter during a traffic stop on Sunday, is a Black mom's worst nightmare, Tolliver said as she watched protesters stand off against police Monday night.
"Everything about it is sad. I'm sad for the family, I'm sad for all the mothers and fathers who fear this type of day," she said. "This is my fear, every day."
Wright's killing and its aftermath is adding new, searing layers of trauma for Twin Citians already reeling over racial inequality in the justice system. As the ongoing trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin displays videos of George Floyd's death over and over, the shooting of yet another unarmed Black man nearby is leaving deep emotional scars.
"The city is going through a crisis, and it's so sad," said Tolliver. "There are a lot of people over here who don't live over here, so my job right now is to keep my family safe."
After officials said an officer mistakenly grabbed a gun instead of a Taser, Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott acknowledged that the police killing "couldn't have happened at a worse time."
"Our hearts are aching right now. We are in pain right now," Elliott said a day after the shooting. "We recognize that this is happening at a time when our community, when all of America, indeed all of the world, is watching our community, that we are all collectively devastated, and we have been for over a year now by the killing of George Floyd."
Early Monday evening, people amassed in droves at the corner of 63rd Avenue and Kathrene Drive for a brief vigil where Wright died.
They left flowers and stood in silence while holding LED candles in the wind. Fluegelhorn player Butchy Austin played "Amazing Grace" as the crowd sang along quietly.
Later, outside the police department, tensions heated between protesters and law enforcement, who exchanged explosives including fireworks and flash bangs.
Another family on the block worried that their neighborhood would end up in the same state as Minneapolis last summer, when rioters burned and looted buildings in the wake of Floyd's death under Chauvin's knee.
Melissa Freese's children, Charity and Eric Chirpich, were sad that school had been canceled in anticipation of unrest, as they were hoping to celebrate their 14th and 12th birthdays on Tuesday with their classmates.
"I feel like I'm OK with you guys protesting," Charity said. "It's just that being an eighth-grader, it's really stressful."
The family watched police launch canisters that exploded with loud flashes into the air above the apartment across from where they stood on Humboldt Avenue.
"There's little kids in those apartment buildings all over, and they can't sleep. â€¦ Violence does not solve violence," Charity said.
"It just makes it worse," Eric said.
A Mother's Love, a peacekeeping group on contract with the city of Minneapolis to provide support services during the Chauvin trial, also appeared in Brooklyn Center to help de-escalate tensions.
"I am mentally and emotionally exhausted," founder Lisa Clemons posted on Facebook.
"I will say this about [Wright's] family. Even in their pain they were the calmest people out there."
Clemons said a relative of Wright stopped several people from crossing police tape and vandalizing squad cars.
"I stood back for quite a while watching him in amazement. I finally walked up to him to hug him and he collapsed in my arms crying. At that point, I couldn't hold back my own tears. This kid touched every fiber of my heart."
On social media, Twin Cities residents expressed dismay and disbelief over the deadly traffic stop, debated looting as an expression of social breakdown and lamented the emotional weight of the past year.
As Ramadan began Monday night, many Muslims were forced to cope with multilayered stressors around the killing of Wright, including questioning whether it was safe to go out during curfew despite religious services being added to a list of exemptions.
"It's fairly transparent that the decisions our state is making are compounding trauma onto the most marginalized people in our community," said Aisha Chughtai, a Minneapolis City Council candidate. "This is a horrific thing to be watching."

Full text: Chemical munitions rained down on mourners in Brooklyn Center as a voice cried out from the crowd.
"Y'all didn't learn from George Floyd."
Brooklyn Center police killed an unarmed Black man on Sunday. On Monday in a courtroom 12 miles south, the trial of a Minneapolis police officer who killed an unarmed Black man resumed.
Daunte Wright was 20 years old. He called his mother before they killed him, scared like every Black man in America gets scared when police lights fill the rearview mirror.
An air freshener dangled from his mirror.
It's illegal to hang air fresheners from your rearview mirror in Minnesota. A driver could get distracted.
A driver could get killed.
It was an accident, police say. An officer pulled her gun instead of her Taser. She was aiming to hurt him and killed him instead.
And what has the Chauvin trial been, if not a weekslong lesson on how easily, how casually, we inflict pain on Black bodies?
Every day, we watch George Floyd die. Every day, he cries out for his mother. Every day, Derek Chauvin's knee grinds into his neck from half a dozen camera angles.
Expert witnesses dissected the killing; freezing and zooming in on the defendant's knee, pointing out how officers' hands pinched and twisted to hurt the handcuffed man pinned beneath the body weight of three grown men. This was the police response to a call about a phony $20 bill.
The top police brass in Minneapolis testified against Chauvin. What he did, they said, was not good police work.
The police department is not on trial. Just the officer the department produced. The one who crushed the breath out of a man last Memorial Day, ignoring screams for mercy from a crowd of children and elders.
Every day, the defense offers up theories about why the victim deserved it. Maybe the drugs killed him as Chauvin was killing him. Maybe calling out "I can't breathe" is an act of resisting arrest. Maybe bystanders pleading for his life distracted the police from saving his life.
Daunte Wright's body was still lying on the street, a police cordon away from his heartbroken mother, when defenders started offering up theories. There was a warrant. His tags were expired. Why didn't he just comply with police? More and more people arrived, grieving and furious because there was no justice, no peace, even while the state was prosecuting police.
Philando Castile complied with police when they pulled him over for a broken headlight and bled to death on Facebook Live. Wright's license tabs were expired, the police chief would later say.
Army medic Lt. Caron Nazario froze when Virginia police officers ordered him to unbuckle his seat belt while somehow also keeping both hands visible out the car window.
"I'm honestly afraid to get out of the car," Nazario said in the body camera footage everyone watched this weekend.
"You should be," the officer said, then Maced him in the face.
The pullover happened in December 2020, but the incident is gaining new scrutiny and attention after he filed a lawsuit against the officers who pulled him over.
People are so tired, so heartsick. But they took to the streets to tell the heavily armed peacekeepers with riot gear and tanks that they can't get over what happened to George Floyd because it keeps on happening.
Daunte Wright won't be there to help his little boy blow out the candles at his second birthday party this summer. This was not good police work.
There were lessons to be learned from Minneapolis' response to the killing of George Floyd. There were times police escalated tensions when they could have stepped back to let the people they wronged grieve in peace.
But by nightfall, Brooklyn Center police -- knowing one of their own had just killed a man she apparently meant to subdue with a less-lethal weapon -- were lobbing flashbangs and projectiles at protesters and filling the air around a nearby apartment complex with tear gas.
A blue-line flag flapped above the police station in Brooklyn Center on Monday. A message to residents in this majority-Black suburb about whose lives matter.
We didn't learn from George Floyd.

Resistance by Floyd justified Chauvin's actions, trainer says

Full text: A longtime police instructor testified Tuesday that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was justified in kneeling on George Floyd for more than nine minutes because he resisted arrest and struggled with officers.
Barry Brodd, a use-of-force expert hired by Chauvin's defense, told the court that placing a suspect stomach-down on the ground is a "control technique" and not use of force because it does not cause pain. He called the position "prone control" while prosecutors have repeatedly called it "prone restraint."
"I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness following Minneapolis Police Department policy and current standards of law enforcement in his interactions with Mr. Floyd," Brodd said.
Brodd was among five witnesses who testified Tuesday, the first day Chauvin's defense began calling witnesses in the trial now entering its sixth week.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Brodd buttressed several defense strategies by testifying that officers must take the totality of the circumstances into consideration when using force, that a crowd of bystanders posed a potential threat to officers, and that compliant suspects can suddenly become noncompliant and dangerous.
"I can't imagine how many times I've been exposed to personally or seen other officers dealing with a traffic stop or jaywalking or some minor offense and they end up in a fight for their life because of the conduct of the individual," said Brodd, who served 22 years with the Santa Rosa Police Department before retiring in 2004.
However, during cross-examination from prosecutor Steve Schleicher, Brodd made statements that could be favorable to the state. Brodd testified that a suspect's large stature or drug use were not automatic grounds to use force, that several bystanders did not appear threatening, and that Chauvin verbally acknowledged Floyd when he complained of experiencing pain in his neck and stomach.
Schleicher attempted to cast doubt on Brodd's assessment of Floyd's conduct.
"Based on your view of the defendant kneeling on Mr. Floyd â€¦ the defendant did not alter the level of force that he was using on Mr. Floyd, did he?" Schleicher asked.
"No," Brodd responded.
"Even though Mr. Floyd had become as you put it, at this point, compliant, fair?" Schleicher asked.
"More compliant, yes," Brodd said.
"Well, what part of this is not compliant?" Schleicher asked.
"â€¦ A compliant person would have both their hands in the small of their back and just be resting comfortably, vs. like he's still moving around," Brodd said.
"Did you say resting comfortably?" Schleicher asked.
"Or laying comfortably," Brodd answered.
"Resting comfortably on the pavement?" Schleicher asked.
"Yes."
"At this point in time when he's attempting to breathe by shoving his shoulder into the pavement?" the prosecutor asked.
"I was describing what the signs of a perfectly compliant person would be," Brodd said.
Brodd is the defense's key use-of-force witness aimed at countering the testimony of several prosecution witnesses, including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who previously testified that Chauvin used excessive force and an unsanctioned maneuver when he knelt on Floyd's neck last May 25.
Under direct questioning from Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, Brodd relayed a hypothetical domestic violence incident he has taught students where an individual is Tased, falls to the ground and strikes his head. The incident isn't deadly force; it's an accidental death, Brodd testified.
Brodd told the court that Floyd's death was not the result of deadly force.
"Police officers don't have to fight fair," he said, adding that officers can escalate their use of force up a level from the force they're facing.
Nelson has argued that Floyd likely died of a drug overdose and pre-existing health issues, including heart disease. The county medical examiner ruled Floyd's cause of death "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." The medical examiner listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system.
Brodd said it's important "to put yourself in the officer's shoes. It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct."
Brodd testified that police used force in getting Floyd into the back of a squad and then in positioning him on the street after he fell out the other side of the vehicle. But, he added, once Floyd was on the ground, the "prone control" position was not a use of force.
"It's a control technique," Brodd said. "It doesn't hurt."
Former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane first encountered Floyd and tried to get him in their squad. Chauvin arrived to assist.
Kueng knelt on Floyd's buttocks and thigh area while Lane knelt and held onto his legs. Former officer Tou Thao kept a crowd of angry bystanders at bay. Kueng, Lane and Thao are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.
Other factors supported Chauvin keeping Floyd on the pavement, Brodd said.
"In this situation there were space limitations, Mr. Floyd was butted up against a patrol car, there was traffic still driving down the street, there were crowd issues that took the attention of the officers, and Mr. Floyd was still somewhat resisting, so I think those were all valid reasons to keep him in the prone," he said.
During cross-examination, Schleicher walked Brodd through several video clips taken from police bodycam footage and cellphone video recorded by bystander Darnella Frazier. He also showed a still image of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck.
Brodd repeatedly disputed Schleicher's definition of "on top" when the prosecutor asked him multiple times if Chauvin was "on top" of Floyd. Brodd said "on top" meant laying his full body atop of Floyd, but he eventually conceded the point.
Brodd testified that Chauvin kept himself in the same general position as Floyd "is becoming more compliant." He also described one of Floyd's arms as "resting comfortably" on the pavement. The state has noted that Floyd used his arms, a hand and a shoulder to ease his breathing under the weight of the officers.
Schleicher reacted to Brodd's characterization of Floyd's arm and asked, "Struggling to breathe is being noncompliant?" No, Brodd said.
Under redirect from Nelson, Brodd said the clips Schleicher played showed "highlights" and not the full sequence of events.
"He's a very strong individual," Brodd said of Floyd, noting how three officers struggled to get him in the squad's back seat.
Earlier in the day, Shawanda Hill testified that she ran into Floyd, her ex-boyfriend, inside Cup Foods last May. He appeared "happy, normal, talking, alert," she said.
But when they went to his vehicle so he could drive her home, he fell asleep, she said, adding that he was tired because he had been working.
Hill testified that she awakened Floyd to warn him that a Minneapolis officer was at his window with a gun drawn. Lane and Kueng were investigating the use of a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes.
" 'Baby, that's the police. Roll down the window,' " Hill said she told Floyd. "â€¦ The man had a gun at the window. [Floyd] instantly grabbed the wheel, and he said, 'Please, please don't shoot me.' "
Nelson has tried to show that Floyd's behavior before and during his encounter with police was affected by drugs, which put the officers on alert.
Hill said she saw nothing to indicate Floyd was having health problems such as shortness of breath or chest pains.
Minneapolis Park Police officer Peter Chang also testified, telling the court he arrived at the scene to watch over Floyd's car and two passengers. He said bystanders were "loud" and "very aggressive" toward the other officers.
Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank tried to quash the notion of a dangerous crowd.
"They never radioed for help, did they?" Frank asked of the other officers' reaction to the crowd.
"No," Chang said.

Full text: In the shadow of the Hennepin County Government Center, as the murder trial for fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin sped toward a close, two families embraced during Tuesday afternoon's April snowfall. It was a rite of public sorrow.
One was George Floyd's family, who have been attending the trial in his death for more than a month.
The other family's mourning was more fresh: the family of Daunte Wright, the 20-year-old shot and killed Sunday afternoon by a Brooklyn Center police officer. The circle of grief included Wright's father and mother, his aunt, his grandmother and his toddler son. They remembered his flashbulb smile and big heart.
And while acknowledging the differences in the cases -- in one, an officer knelt on a man's neck for more than nine minutes; in the other, an officer mixed up her gun and her Taser, according to Brooklyn Center police -- the families drew a line connecting their grief, their calls for justice and their calls for reform.
What should have been routine police interactions ending with no more than a ticket, they said, turned into excessive force and another unnecessary death of a Black man.
"She was the law, right?" Wright's aunt, Naisha Wright, said of the Brooklyn Center officer, Kim Potter, who resigned on Tuesday. "Put her in jail like they would do any one of us. â€¦ It wouldn't be no accident. It would be murder.
"Did y'all not see that beautiful baby?" Naisha Wright pleaded. "He is fatherless. Not over a mistake. Over murder. That's murder."
They were joined by families of several others killed by law enforcement in Minnesota in recent years.
"Minneapolis, you all can't sweep this under the rug anymore," said Philonise Floyd, one of George Floyd's brothers.
"We saw this video of this young man, Daunte Wright, and the police are saying that the young man was running from them," said another of Floyd's brothers, Rodney Floyd. "What I saw on the man's face was a scared young kid. Terrified. Black folks, we've been here 400-plus years. We've been running ever since from these police officers trying to kill us. Back then that was called the slave patrol. Now it's called the police."
As Floyd's family spoke, Wright's son, Daunte Jr., babbled and cried nearby.
Katie Wright, Daunte Wright's mother, recalled the trauma of Sunday afternoon: She got a call from Daunte, saying police had pulled him over. "Am I in trouble?" she heard Daunte ask before hanging up the phone.
"When I called back, the girl he had in the car answered the phone, and it was on a FaceTime," she recalled. "She was crying and screaming and she said they shot him. And she pointed the phone toward the driver's seat, and my son was laying there, unresponsive. That was the last time that I seen my son."
As the two families leaned on each other for support, a political battle over further police accountability legislation continued at the State Capitol.
Less than one year after lawmakers passed a sweeping package of reforms following George Floyd's death, Democratic state lawmakers and DFL Gov. Tim Walz have insisted that the changes don't go far enough toward reducing deadly police encounters.
Some DFL state legislators this week are also insisting that the Legislature pass new police accountability bills into law before any negotiations over the state's next two-year budget can start -- something that must be agreed upon before the May 17 end of this year's session.
Six DFL state senators who are part of the People of Color and Indigenous (POCI) Caucus released a statement Tuesday calling on Walz and the Legislature's leadership "to suspend all policy and budget negotiations until both the House and Senate have heard and adopted legislation on police accountability."
Group members underlined priorities such as bills to establish civilian police oversight councils, funding for community organizations to prevent crime, legislation banning officers from affiliating with white supremacist groups and a ban on altering or destroying body camera footage. Democratic lawmakers also want to end qualified immunity for police officers.
"We cannot keep doing the same things and expect a different result," said state Rep. Samantha Vang, a Brooklyn Center Democrat who chairs the POCI Caucus.
Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said on Tuesday that he has asked his Judiciary and Transportation committees to hold "fact-finding" hearings on new police accountability proposals within two weeks.
Last year's package of police policy changes included a ban on chokeholds, the elimination of "warrior training" and changes to the arbitration process when officers are fired or disciplined. Meanwhile, lawmakers passed a new requirement that officers intercede when they observe misconduct by their peers.
"I'm not promising that we are going to do more reforms, I'm promising to listen to see if something is warranted," Gazelka said.
Ben Crump, the civil rights attorney representing both Floyd's family and Wright's family, said outside the courthouse he was stunned that the Brooklyn Center shooting happened during the Chauvin trial.
"We believed," Crump said, "that police would be on their best behavior.
"When you think about the fact Daunte was trying to get away -- he was not a threat to them!" Crump continued. "Was it the best decision? No. But young people don't always make the best decisions. As his mother said, he was scared."
Standing near Crump was someone whose family represented the historical sweep of the moment: Deborah Watts, a Minneapolis resident who co-founded the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation. Till was the 14-year-old boy who was lynched and killed in 1955 in Mississippi, a brutal race-based killing considered one of the pivotal moments of the civil rights movement.
Watts is Till's cousin.
"The past is not the past," she said, "until justice is served."

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 4/14/2021: In this story Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott was misidentified as the mayor of a neighboring city. Demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officers in Brooklyn Center for the second night in a row Monday following the fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Black man by a police officer.
Protesters had been on hand throughout the day outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department, but the scene escalated after the start of a 7 p.m. curfew across four Twin Cities metro counties instituted by Gov. Tim Walz.
About 300 people attended a separate, peaceful vigil for Daunte Wright earlier in the evening at the site of the traffic stop that ended with his shooting.
"Right now, this community, this city, this state, our nation, our country, our world is broken," said the Rev. Jeanette Rupert, who also works as an ICU nurse and said she came to speak at the vigil before her night shift. "We have had the knees on our neck for so long."
Coming amid the high-profile criminal trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in George Floyd's death, Wright's fatal shooting in the suburb directly north of Minneapolis also ignited a clash late Sunday between demonstrators and law enforcement officers.
By shortly before 8 p.m. Monday, police began to warn demonstrators, who still numbered in the hundreds, that they were in violation of curfew. Officers began to move toward the fence in formation and issued orders to disperse.
Authorities fired multiple rounds of tear gas, along with rubber bullets and flash grenades. Protesters dispersed from areas hit by tear gas were regrouping and retaliating by throwing water bottles and launching fireworks. Later, lines of police in riot gear pushed groups of protesters away from the station. At a strip mall near the police station, looters broke into several businesses, including a Dollar Tree store where flames were later spotted.
Earlier in the day, Police Chief Tim Gannon said that the officer appeared to have fired her gun accidentally when intending to fire a Taser.
"I just need everyone to know that he was my life. He was my son," Wright's mother, Katie Wright, said at a vigil at the site of the fatal traffic stop. "And I can never get that back. Because of a mistake? Because of an accident?"
At the vigil near the corner of 63rd Avenue and Orchard Avenue N., activists brought in the large wooden fist that for much of the past year sat at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was killed last May. A metal replica now stands where the original once did.
Several pastors prayed for the Wright family, and trumpet player Butchy Austin, who lives near George Floyd Square, ended the vigil with "Amazing Grace." In addition to Wright's mother, his brother and grandfather addressed the crowd.
"I would never think in a million years that this would happen to my grandson," Bobby Wright said. "He didn't deserve it."
The service broke up around the time the curfew started, with organizers urging participants to head home.
Earlier in the day, police erected a fence and concrete barricades around the department's perimeter, and it was ringed by uniformed soldiers of the Minnesota National Guard and Minnesota State Patrol officers, who were ramping up their presence at potential hot spots throughout the metro at Walz's direction. The governor instituted a 7 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew for Hennepin, Ramsey, Anoka and Dakota counties.
Walz and other local leaders urged peaceful protests while vowing consequences for those who damage property.
"You cannot honor the memory of George Floyd, you cannot honor the memory of Daunte Wright by wreaking havoc in the communities they called home," St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said at an afternoon briefing. Business owners across the metro scrambled to close early.
Emergency responders and the media were exempt from the curfew, as were those traveling directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness.
Those traveling to and from religious services were also exempt from the curfew, an exception clarified after the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement condemning officials for preventing prayer gatherings on the first night of Ramadan.
The curfew did little to prevent the chaotic scene around the police station, as authorities fired numerous rounds of tear gas canisters. At least one canister was seen landing and going off on the garden-level porch of an apartment across the street. At one point, Brooklyn Park Mayor Mike Elliott was spotted in the crowd asking protesters for calm.
"We are going to get to the bottom of this. We are going to make sure there is justice," Elliott said.
At 11 p.m., Elliott tweeted that "Our city is calm now."
Tayler Larsen, a 21-year-old who said she lives just down the street from the Police Department, was demonstrating outside the building Monday night with a sign that read, "Will my brother be next?" Another protester's sign read "Murder, Murder, Murder."
"It's just really disheartening. It's hard on all of us, it's hard on this community," Larsen said. "We're still trying to get through George Floyd."

Full text: Prosecutors trying former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in George Floyd's death called their last witnesses Monday, including one of Floyd's younger brothers, who broke down in tears as he testified about their childhood in Texas.
While prosecutors have not yet officially rested their case, they are not expected to call any more witnesses following 11 days of testimony. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill told jurors Chauvin's defense is expected to begin calling its witnesses Tuesday.
The defense could finish its case by Thursday, Cahill said, adding that the court would likely take Friday off and resume next Monday with closing arguments from both sides. Jurors will be sequestered for deliberations.
Philonise Floyd, 39, testified in the early afternoon about his oldest brother, who served as the family's leader and a beacon of influence in their housing complex in Houston.
"George, he would always be up on our mom," Philonise Floyd said. "He was a big mama's boy. â€¦ Every mother loves all of her kids but it's so unique how they were. He would lay up on her like in the fetus position like he was in the womb."
A bystander's video of Floyd's May 25 arrest captured Floyd pleading for breath and calling out "Mama" a few times as Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes while he lay handcuffed, stomach-down in the street.
Former officers J. Alexander Kueng knelt on his buttocks and Thomas Lane held onto his legs as Tou Thao kept angry bystanders at bay.
Chauvin is on trial on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Kueng, Lane and Thao are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.
Philonise Floyd broke into tears when a photo of their mother holding Floyd as a baby was shown to the jury.
"He loved her so dearly," he said, adding that his brother taught the family how to love and respect their mother. "â€¦ I miss both of them."
Philonise Floyd was emotional as he told the court that his wedding anniversary is May 24, a day before his brother died and six days before their mother died three years ago.
"It's like a bittersweet month, because I'm supposed to be happy when that month comes," he said.
Floyd, who had moved from Texas to Minnesota years before, spoke to their mother on the phone while she was in hospice care but didn't see her before she died on May 30, 2018, Philonise Floyd said. Floyd repeatedly called out "Mama" to her at her funeral and wouldn't leave the casket, he testified. Her funeral was the last time the brothers saw each other in person, although they kept in touch afterward.
In their Texas housing complex, Philonise Floyd said, his brother "was one of those people in the community, when they had church outside, people would attend church just because he was there. Nobody would go out there until they seen him. He was a person everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better."
Philonise Floyd frequently spent time with his brother "playing video games all the time" as children despite an approximately seven-year age gap.
"George, also, he used to make the best banana mayonnaise sandwiches â€¦ because George, he couldn't cook. He couldn't boil water," Philonise Floyd testified, adding that his brother made sure everyone at home had something to eat despite an absence of cooking skills.
Marks on a wall in the family home tracked Floyd's growth. "He wanted to be taller all the time because he loved sports," Philonise Floyd said. "He wanted to be the best."
In an interview last week with the Star Tribune, Philonise Floyd reflected on the approaching anniversary of his brother's death.
"I know God was there â€¦" he said. He recounted how several strangers converged at the scene of his brother's arrest in south Minneapolis and became integral to the prosecution's case, among them: Donald Williams Jr., a trained martial arts fighter who testified about the impact of Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck; Darnella Frazier, who recorded the incident and shared it online with the world; Judeah Reynolds, then 9, who wore a shirt emblazoned with "Love" across the front; and off-duty Minneapolis firefighter Genevieve Hanson, who tried to intervene but was rebuffed by the officers.
"That'll be seared in all of their minds forever," Philonise Floyd said of the officers' response to Hanson's offer of help.
The high number of civilian witnesses to Floyd's death is unusual for killings involving police in Minnesota, which are rarely prosecuted. Floyd's death is the fourth time officers have been charged in the state with killing a civilian on the job.
Testimony began Monday with cardiologist Dr. Jonathan Rich, a medical expert from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in the Chicago area. The prosecution called him to counter defense contentions that Floyd died from health problems and illicit drug use.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office ruled Floyd's cause of death "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." The office also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system.
"I believe that Mr. George Floyd's death was absolutely preventable," Rich testified.
Rich said he believes Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by low oxygen levels that were "induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxia that he was subjected to."
Further, the doctor said, "I can state with a high degree of medical certainty that George Floyd did not die from a cardiac event and he did not die from an overdose."
The doctor agreed that Floyd had a significant presence of heart disease but tried to fend off defense attorney Eric Nelson's questions about the dangers of narrowed arteries by noting that the heart builds new paths for blood to circulate under such conditions.
Academic use-of-force expert and former police officer Seth W. Stoughton, of the University of South Carolina Law School was the prosecution's last witness.
Stoughton walked through several video clips of Floyd's arrest and said he never should have been placed stomach-down on the pavement.
Floyd told officers "thank you" for being removed from the squad car and put on his knees, he testified, and was never a flight risk or a threat to the officers' safety.
"No reasonable officer would have believed that [the restraint used on Floyd] was appropriate, acceptable or reasonable force," he testified.
Nelson attempted to raise doubts about Stoughton's analysis by noting that he had the luxury of hindsight and reviewed arrest videos in slow motion. Under cross-examination, Stoughton agreed that officers are allowed to use force based on the "totality of the circumstances."
"â€¦ The suspect does not get to dictate, 'Do I get to sit on the ground,' or, 'Do I get to sit in the squad car?' " Nelson asked, referring to Floyd's refusal to get into the back seat of a squad car before he was forced in, fell out the other side and ended up on the street.
"Yes," Stoughton eventually answered.

Full text: It was a decision made in the best interests of their respective franchises, fans, players and staff. Collectively, they arrived at the same conclusion: Monday was not the day to play games.
The Twins, Wolves and Wild were in contact with each other Monday morning, the day after the unnecessary death of Daunte Wright. They exchanged notes and shared feelings about the best way to proceed while a community grieved the loss of one of its own.
They also were in contact with local and state officials, as well as league offices. The Twins were aware that Minneapolis was considering installing a curfew but weren't sure if it was going to happen. As the Twins prepared to play Boston at soggy Target Field, the decision was made to postpone the afternoon game. And there is a chance the Twins and Red Sox won't play on Tuesday either.
Playing games Monday would have been a blunder. A community still aching from the killing of George Floyd last May just had its wound reopened.
"Our community has been through a lot," Twins President Dave St. Peter said. "We have a trial taking place just blocks away from Target Field. Emotions across our community, emotions across our organization are raw. Based on the events of the last 24 hours and as information has started to come to light, playing a baseball game today felt a little less important."
The Wolves, who hosted prospective buyers Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore in town Monday, and the Wild, looking to avoid a sweep by St. Louis, soon arrived at the same conclusion: that there are more important things going on in this town today than games.
The hundreds of National Guard members positioning themselves around Minneapolis on Monday and the implementation of a 7 p.m. curfew attested to that.
Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by a veteran police officer Sunday afternoon during a traffic stop. Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon said Monday the car Wright was driving had expired tabs, and there was a warrant out on him for a gross misdemeanor. Wright got back into the vehicle as officers were trying to take him into custody and was shot by the police officer, who can be heard on the body camera footage yelling, "Taser! Taser!"
Gannon deemed it an "accidental discharge." Others view it as another Black man unjustly killed by police.
As news of this killing spread Sunday, and Sunday night turned into Monday morning, protests turned into violence.
Not here. Not again.
That disheartened feeling returned as I monitored the rock-throwing and looting breaking out in Brooklyn Center and in parts of Minneapolis as Sunday night went on. I watched while Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher aired a Facebook Live drive-along as he and other officers attempted to disperse people who were looting a shopping mall in Brooklyn Center. Police alerts from different parts of Minneapolis landed on social media. Bedtime: 4 a.m. Later Monday, I drove down Lake Street around lunchtime and saw a shop and a gas station that were attacked the night before. The shop was being boarded up, the gas station roped up.
Not here. Not again.
And then there was a stunning confluence of developments in about an hour span on Monday. Brooklyn Center releasing bodycam footage of the encounter with Wright, footage from the Floyd encounter being shown during the Derek Chauvin trial, and the Twins postponing their game against the Red Sox.
"All of us, all of us, especially us in Minnesota right now, are tired in a lot of ways of having these types of conversations," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. "There's a huge disappointment and sadness when you have to wake up to these things."
The Twins took a knee on Opening Day last year for racial justice and donated $25 million to support that cause. This year, a "Justice For George Floyd" banner runs along the bottom of the fence in left-center field, below the bullpens. But as the Chauvin trial continues, this community is stunned by another officer-involved shooting of a Black person.
No, Monday wasn't the day to play games. It was about taking time to figure out a better way.

Full text: George Floyd died in police custody after a corner store clerk reported he had used a fake $20 bill, a nonviolent offense so low-level that police don't usually take people to jail for it.
Now, as the trial over his death continues to unfold, criminal justice reform experts and diversity specialists are hoping the case will prompt retailers -- from small businesses to major chains -- to reassess how they treat Black and other minority customers and how they can handle loss prevention cases more equitably.
Retailers, they point out, are on the front lines of racial justice in their own stores.
"While interactions with the police can be fairly infrequent, everyone shops," said Cassi Pittman Claytor, a sociology professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who has studied racial profiling in retail settings. "When [Black people] are asked about the contexts where they are treated unfairly due to their race â€¦ shopping in a store ranks above all other settings, including interactions with the police."
Since Floyd's death last May, many retailers have made public promises committing to racial equity. Several companies, including Twin Cities-based Target
and Best Buy, have shared their plans to diversify hiring and made financial contributions to Black-owned businesses and organizations focused on fighting inequality.
But some criminal justice reform advocates say retailers need to do more to create and enforce policies to address how racial bias negatively impacts customers.
"I don't think that they really have dealt with and have been honest about dealing with it," said Jesse Ross, a local diversity and inclusion consultant who has worked with a range of retailers. "It's 'Oh we're going to put out money,' and 'Oh, we're going to give a couple bonuses' and all of these things, but we are not addressing the very grassroots-level issues that could probably prevent so many other things like a George Floyd from happening."
Ross, who is Black, said he has been racially profiled in stores, and he doesn't think many retailers have transparent complaint processes where they evaluate and respond to reports of customer mistreatment.
"Certainly in loss prevention, there are certain behaviors that look sketchy that you are supposed to look out for or pay attention to, but then there's also that profiling that we know happens," Ross said.
In response to community outcry following Floyd's death, the owner of the Cup Foods store said they would no longer contact police in cases of nonviolent crime, as they did for Floyd's suspected counterfeit bill.
Raymond Moss, who runs the St. Paul-based Carl Moss Institute that helps young people who have been incarcerated re-enter society, believes more stores need to forgo calling the police for small crimes and change the loss prevention culture among their security officers and staff. Moss worked as a loss prevention officer for large department stores for more than five years when he was younger and now runs his own security company in the Detroit area, in addition to teaching criminal justice college courses online.
Some big-box stores promote making apprehensions, Moss said: "Like you got a board up there, everybody has their name on there and they might set a goal that you need to get four apprehensions for the month. It's nothing in there to say 'be a deterrent, let's deter folks from stealing.' "
While security officers are told not to profile people, Moss, who is Black, said he has seen co-workers follow groups of Black shoppers around the store floor. Moss would try to play his two-way radio loud when he got close to somebody he suspected was stealing to scare them into ditching the item. He said he has seen how a minor crime like shoplifting can lead to a life of serious crime.
"Retail is almost like a gateway to other small-type petty crimes," he said.
When police do become involved, people should be steered to diversion programs with groups that are familiar with working with youth of color, Moss said. Retailers should also phase out using off-duty police officers for store security, he said.
Racial stereotypes that link Black people to criminality lead to excessive surveillance of Black people in stores, despite the fact that shoplifting is a common crime in the general population, Pittman Claytor said. Approximately 1 in 11 Americans have shoplifted, according to the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention.
Yet many people of color say they have experienced racial profiling in stores. Nearly a quarter of Black respondents to a Gallup poll conducted last summer said they felt they were treated unfairly because of their race while shopping during the preceding 30 days.
Pittman Claytor was one of several researchers tapped by makeup retailer Sephora to collaborate on a study released in January on the state of racial bias in retail. The report showed that limited racial diversity in marketing, merchandise and store staffing results in exclusionary treatment of people of color. Also, many shoppers of color reported using coping mechanisms such as dressing in more expensive clothes to minimize or avoid anticipated bias.
The Sephora study suggests several ways retailers can address racially biased and exclusionary treatment, including employee trainings on unconscious bias and neutral signals for what type of help customers want, such as different colored shopping baskets to indicate whether a customer would like assistance.
Though bias training is popular, research has shown it can have limited effectiveness if it is not part of a more comprehensive strategy, Pittman Claytor said, comparing it to attending an exercise class once a year and thinking it will result in better health.
Sephora has created its own action plan with, among other things, plans to reduce the presence of third-party security, establish a diversity and inclusion experience dashboard to provide feedback to stores on a monthly basis, and larger, sweeping changes.
Though several other large retailers declined to comment on any possible changes to how they handle loss prevention and bias, many are discussing it as a group, according to the National Retail Federation.
"I think maybe years ago when companies started implementing diversity programs, it was because maybe there was a reaction to incidents, [but] now the frame of mind is that we have to be proactive to implement programs," said Leon Buck, the federation's vice president for banking and financial services.
Buck chairs a group of about 90 major retail brands that meets virtually once a month to talk about diversity and inclusion including recruiting and retaining diverse employees as well as retail racism and implicit bias.
But many smaller retailers must figure out policies on their own.
Diya Shuaibi, manager of Premium Stop on White Bear Avenue on the East Side of St. Paul, said he tries to avoid unnecessary confrontations with customers and keeps rules and regulations in plain view. If somebody gives him money he thinks is fake, Shuaibi tells the customer he or she could leave the money and the store, or he will call police. Most of the time, the threat of police deters a conflict and the person leaves, but Shuaibi said he isn't afraid to call police when he feels unsafe.
"We are living on the streets," he said. "I'm trying to protect myself as much as I can. There's no option except the police. â€¦ We are on our own."
Hussein Khatib, co-owner of Adam's Food and Fuel, also on St. Paul's East Side, said he doesn't typically call police when he has problems at his gas station, choosing instead to try to de-escalate situations. When he catches a young person stealing, Khatib tries to talk to them and possibly their parents.
"You have to gain community trust. â€¦ You have to be involved within your community," Khatib said. "You have to give respect to earn respect."

Will Derek Chauvin testify?: Some say he must explain his state of mind; others say he'll only hurt his case.

Full text: As former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's defense presents its case this week against charges that he murdered George Floyd, a question looms over his trial: Will Chauvin testify in his own defense?
Under the U.S. Constitution, defendants have a right to refrain from testifying without penalty, but some local attorneys said there are compelling reasons for Chauvin to get on the witness stand.
"You've got to remember that this is a case that really centers on Chauvin's state of mind, and the best person to tell us about that would be Chauvin, so you might really be forced to put him on in this case," said veteran defense attorney Joe Friedberg.
The issue is likely to arise soon as prosecutors cap off two weeks of testimony in their case early in the week. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, is expected to begin calling witnesses for a few days of testimony before jurors begin deliberations. Nelson has not said whether his client will testify.
Chauvin faces charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other former officers who were at the scene of Floyd's May 25 arrest -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.
Other attorneys and legal scholars said there's little Chauvin can say to overcome a bystander's graphic video showing him kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as he pleaded for his life and repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. Pleas for mercy from several horrified bystanders, including children and an off-duty Minneapolis firefighter, were also captured in the video.
"Chauvin doesn't come across as a character that you want to root for because of the video," said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. "[Prosecutors will] take him through every single second of that video and have him testify. In cross-examination he'll just get beat up. It'll be horrible for him. The risk is so immense for him to testify."
In a recent interview, Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, and sister-in-law, Keeta Floyd, said they want to hear from Chauvin.
" â€¦ He won't be able to handle what's thrown at him, because how can you explain that you had your knee on a man's neck for nine minutes? How can you explain that? There's no way to explain. You can't," Philonise Floyd said. "So it will be a good thing [if he testifies], but I know that's not going to happen."
Prosecutors have argued that Chauvin used excessive force and an unsanctioned maneuver when he knelt on Floyd. Testimony from several Minneapolis police leaders, including Chief Medaria Arradondo and Lt. Richard Zimmerman, the department's head of homicide, supported the state's claims.
Nelson has argued that Floyd likely died of a drug overdose complicated by pre-existing health issues, including heart disease. Nelson told jurors Floyd was resisting arrest so forcibly that it rocked a parked police squad back and forth, and that Chauvin followed his training amid a threatening crowd.
Defense attorney Mike Padden said Chauvin needs to testify to explain the reasoning behind his actions and to apologize, which could help negate the "depraved mind" element needed to convict him on third-degree murder.
"I don't think he has any choice but to testify," said Padden, who believes a conviction is more likely on third-degree murder than second-degree murder. "It'll be a mistake if he doesn't. The jury needs to hear from him, that's the bottom line."
Friedberg said Chauvin's testimony could also further the defense's argument that he placed his knee on Floyd's shoulder. Nelson has introduced the concept of "camera perspective bias" and played clips of police bodycam videos that showed Chauvin's knee on Floyd's shoulder. The state has countered that with images of the knee on the neck.
"When the defendant takes the stand and denies the things that make up the crime, that's got to make the jury pause â€¦," Friedberg said. "If the jury gets into an argument about where the knee is, that's a good thing for the defense."
All three officers who have been previously tried in Minnesota for killing a civilian on the job -- Jeronimo Yanez, Mohamed Noor and Brian Krook -- testified at their trials. But unlike in Chauvin's case, all three officers said they acted because of a perceived threat to their life or the lives of others. Two of the civilians in the previous cases also possessed guns.
While Nelson has previously said in court filings that Floyd posed a potential threat, the issue has played a minimal role so far at trial.
The amount of time Chauvin knelt on Floyd is also a key difference. Through their attorneys or in direct testimony, Yanez and Noor said they were forced to make a "split-second" decision to use deadly force, a phrase and defense that resonates with jurors, who often give police the benefit of the doubt, attorneys said.
Yanez and Krook were acquitted. Noor was convicted.
Chauvin can't help his case by testifying, said defense attorneys A.L. Brown and Andrew Gordon. Testifying would also open the door for prosecutors to probe his background and past policing depending on his answers.
"He's not incredibly sympathetic, so he doesn't offer much by way of story line," Brown said. "It's even worse for Chauvin because he's got the chief of police saying: This guy's not with us. We didn't teach him to do that."
Gordon predicted that Chauvin would not testify given how infrequently he appeared as a character in Nelson's opening statement two weeks ago. Nelson first mentioned Chauvin about halfway through his 24-minute opening statement, and kept references to him brief and specific to his actions at the scene. There was no deeper dive into Chauvin's 19-year career with Minneapolis police or his role as a trainer for new officers. There was no mention of details about Chauvin's background and life.
"Most defense attorneys will tell you that you have to spend some time in your opening statement humanizing your client," Gordon said. "You need them to be a person for the jurors. â€¦ Ultimately, though, they likely made a strategic move to not dwell on it, since they have a baked-in advantage: Chauvin is a cop, and the uniform and badge does a lot of the humanizing for them."
While the topic of testifying was surely discussed between Chauvin and Nelson long before trial began five weeks ago with jury selection, the final call often occurs at the end of the defense's case, attorneys said. Defendants can testify at any point once their attorneys begin calling witnesses; they typically take the stand at the end of their case.
Attorneys consider a number of factors in determining whether a defendant should testify: what they add to the evidence, how well they handle difficult questions and how believable they are.
"So much of this is a gut check for us," said defense attorney Michael Brandt. "We will have someone come in and do a whole mock examination and mock cross-examination so the client, should they choose to testify, will be prepared."
Nelson has represented clients in high-profile cases who testified at trial: A tearful Amy Senser testified in 2012 about the night she fatally struck Anousone Phanthavong with her car and left the scene. Senser, the wife of former Minnesota Viking Joe Senser, was convicted of criminal vehicular homicide.
In 2015, then 20-year-old Levi Acre-Kendall testified in a Wisconsin courtroom about the night he fatally stabbed Peter Kelly in self-defense when Kelly dragged him out of a car following verbal jabs between their groups of friends. Acre-Kendall was acquitted of all counts.
"I wish I could take it all back," a soft-spoken Acre-Kendall testified as he broke down in tears. "I'm so sorry." Acre-Kendall remained calm in the face of aggressive cross-examination from the prosecutor.
Nelson credited Acre-Kendall's testimony with turning the case in the defense's favor. "His testimony, in general, was honest," Nelson said at the time. "It was sincere. It was heartfelt."
All else aside, a defendant's likability plays a major role in putting them on the stand, said Brandt and Friedberg.
"Remember now," Friedberg said, "[Chauvin would be] taking the stand as the most hated man in America."

Key testimony from Week Two
The second week of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin saw 16 witnesses, including testimony from the Minneapolis police chief, police trainers, a physician at the emergency room when Floyd was brought in and Hennepin County's chief medical examiner.
" Clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcu ed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy, part of our training, and is certainly not part of our ethics or values."
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo
"You want to use the least amount of force necessary to meet your objective to control."
Lt. Johnny Mercil, use-of-force trainer with MPD
"Somebody could be in respiratory distress and still be able to verbalize it."
Nicole Mackenzie, medical support coordinator for MPD
"I don't know what kind of improvised position this is."
Katie Blackwell, Minneapolis police inspector
"When it is safe and feasible, we shall de-escalate."
Ker Yang, MPD crisis trainer
" You can see slight fl ickering and then it disappears, so one second he's alive and one second he's no longer. ... That's the moment the life goes out of his body."
Dr. Martin Tobin, the prosecution's medical expert
"The law enforcement subdual restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions."
Dr. Andrew Baker, Hennepin County's chief medical examiner
"He's using his strength to get himself into a position where he can breathe."
Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a veteran medical examiner
"I felt [a heart attack] was less likely based on the information available to us."

Full text: Hennepin County's chief medical examiner testified in Derek Chauvin's murder trial Friday that George Floyd's underlying heart disease contributed to his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, and that being held down on the street outside Cup Foods was "just more than Mr. Floyd could take."
Dr. Andrew Baker's testimony came after three other medical experts had already testified in Chauvin's Hennepin County District Court trial on second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter charges. Cause of death is a pivotal point for prosecutors and the defense.
Baker's findings, based on his autopsy the day after Floyd died, determined he died from "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." He did not cite a lack of oxygen, or asphyxia, a cause found by three prior prosecution experts, including Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a medical examiner who worked on Baker's staff from 2013 to 2017.
"In this case, I believe the primary mechanism of death is asphyxia, or low oxygen," said Thomas, a medical examiner of 37 years who retired from Hennepin County.
Questioned further by prosecutor Jerry Blackwell, she said, "There's no evidence to suggest he would have died that night except for the interactions with law enforcement."
The prosecution is trying to show that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen caused by police holding him prone and handcuffed on the pavement. Defense lawyer Eric Nelson is trying to sow reasonable doubt, raising the prospect that Floyd died by heart attack brought on by illicit drug use and health problems.
Baker, who has been the county's chief medical examiner since 2004, said the 46-year-old Floyd had "very severe" hypertensive heart disease, meaning his heart weighed more than it should, requiring more oxygen.
"Now in the context of an altercation with other people that involves things like physical restraint, it involves things like being held to the ground, it involves things like the pain that you would incur from having your cheek up against the asphalt and that abrasion on your shoulder, those events are gonna cause stress hormones to pour out of your body, specifically things like adrenaline, and what that adrenaline is going to do is it's going to ask your heart to beat faster," Baker testified. "It's going to ask your body for more oxygen so that you can get through that altercation, and in my opinion, the law enforcement subdual restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions."
While earlier medical testimony doubted that Floyd's physical condition or his drug use played a role in the death, Baker said under questioning by defense attorney Nelson that "in my opinion, yes," they were factors.
Asked by Nelson whether Floyd died of asphyxiation, Baker said: "That's something we don't really see, pressure to the back of the neck resulting in strangulation."
Nelson also asked again about the amount of fentanyl found in Floyd's body during the autopsy.
The lawyer had Baker disclose what he told prosecutors earlier about whether Floyd overdosed, and Baker replied, "I don't recall specifically what I told the county attorney, but it almost certainly went something like this: Had Mr. Floyd been home alone in his locked residence with no evidence of trauma, and the only autopsy finding was that fentanyl level, then yes, I would certify his death as due to fentanyl toxicity."
Baker began his testimony by saying he was aware of little more than Floyd had died in police custody at the hospital, but he avoided videos of Floyd's arrest and death until after the autopsy. "I don't want to go into autopsies with a preconceived notion about what already happened. It might cause me to skip something," he said.
He then was shown photos he took from the autopsy.
The doctor said one image showed bruises and scrapes to Floyd's left eyebrow area. He said Floyd suffered those while "pinned against the asphalt."
Prosecutor Blackwell asked, "In the prone position?" Baker responded, "Yes."
Blackwell earlier questioned Thomas, Baker's former assistant.
She said that although Floyd's heart stopped, he didn't die from a heart attack. She also said Floyd died from subdual restraint and neck compression.
Thomas said she agreed with Baker's determination on the cause of death. However, Thomas' declaration runs counter to Baker's assessment in a meeting with the FBI that he could not say whether Floyd would have lived "but for" the officers' use of force, according to documents obtained in the case.
"Baker did not believe that the prone position was any more dangerous than other positions based on an article or journal he had read," said a summary of the meeting.
He also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and illicit drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system, Baker's autopsy results noted.
Thomas, however, testified that the physical stress of being prone must be taken into account.
"Mr. Floyd was already in a position where he was experiencing difficulty breathing and getting enough oxygen in this body," she said. "On top of that, now there's the physiological stress that's putting increased demand on his heart, lungs and muscles. â€¦ He's using his strength to get himself into a position where he can breathe."
In cross-examination by Nelson, he said to Thomas, "Let's assume you found Mr. Floyd dead in his residence, no police involvement, no drugs, the only thing you found were these facts about his heart. What would you conclude is the cause of death?"
She responded, "In those very narrow circumstances, I would probably conclude that the cause of death was his heart disease."
Thomas also revisited ground covered by previous medical experts concerning injuries on Floyd's body, saying they indicated his struggle to open his chest to breathe: scrapes on his knuckles, face and shoulders. The judge then had photos of the injuries distributed to the jurors, and Thomas explained what they depicted and why the images "are consistent that he is pushing himself so he can get in a position to breathe."
In the end, Baker stood firmly behind his initial ruling. "My opinion remains unchanged," Baker said as his testimony concluded. "That was my top line then, [and] it would remain my top line now."
Prosecution testimony continues Monday.

Full text: The Minneapolis Civil Rights Commission formed a task force to "create and disseminate messaging" surrounding the trials of the ex-officers charged in the death of George Floyd -- but the City Attorney's Office has advised them not to release their statement.
The instruction has frustrated some of the volunteer commissioners, who sought to publicly encourage peaceful protests, condemn white supremacy and police brutality and exhort elected leaders and police to emphasize the importance of de-escalating tense situations instead of resorting to force.
"Speaking for myself, the last thing I would want to do is to interfere with this trial that's going on," said Commissioner Ken Rance.
He added: "We have an obligation as a Civil Rights Commission to stand up for the civil rights of all residents."
Commissioners discussed statements at public meetings. Possibilities included submitting an opinion piece to the Star Tribune, posting on social media or publishing it on their website.
The question of when and how to discuss the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin has challenged city leaders, who want to acknowledge the pain that arose from Floyd's death and avoid accusations of interfering with the proceedings.
Nearly a month ago, during the first week of jury selection, Minneapolis City Council members and Mayor Jacob Frey agreed that the city would pay $27 million to settle the lawsuit filed by Floyd's family. Some officials later joined the family in a news conference.
The elected leaders' remarks prompted a sharp rebuke from Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who said he wished they would stop publicly discussing the criminal trial. Cahill dismissed two previously selected jurors who said news of the settlement changed their view of the case.
The Civil Rights Commission, created in 1975, consists of 21 members whose primary responsibility is promoting civil rights and enforcing local ordinances on the topic.
The city's ordinances outline nine powers and duties for the commission, including advising "the mayor, the City Council and departments or agencies of government with respect to matters relating to the commission's purposes" and "conduct public meetings and forums, and gather and disseminate information to governmental agencies and to the public."
When she advised against making public statements, Susan Trammell, an attorney for the city, cited Cahill's remarks and also concluded that the task force lacked the authority to issue press statements like the one it drafted.
City spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie said the City Attorney's Office concluded that local ordinances limit the commission's authority to advising the city's leaders and government agencies and its "powers do not include issuing press statements."
Commissioner Mark Stignani said he saw Trammell's statement as a "direct challenge to our independence and ability to speak to the public." Others said they worried the commission's work was being delayed, or they were troubled that a statement condemning white supremacy was being blocked.
The commissioners created the task force during their February meeting after Rance asked if they intended to address the trials.
The commissioners voted 18-0 to form a group to draft statements for the commission. They called it the Accountability for the Killing of George Floyd Task Force.
Since then, task force members drafted a statement that sought to encourage peaceful protest and condemn police brutality and white supremacy -- while refraining from weighing in directly on Chauvin's guilt or innocence.
"Where's the fault in that?" Rance said in an interview. "Why would there be opposition to that?"

Full text: Halfway through Pastor Curtis Farrar's Sunday service in the parking lot of his church at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, he quit talking to the congregation and spoke directly to the men who stand at the intersection's northeast corner day after day.
"Young man across the street, I told the Lord I will preach until the day I die because I want to see as many young men, like some of us, right in here," he said, his voice reverberating over loudspeakers across the intersection now known as George Floyd Square. "It doesn't matter how tough you may be, what you do, what you may be carrying. We used to pack, too."
Some members still carry guns, even in church, Farrar quipped to laughs. "You out there, we'll wait for you. Come on! Come on from across the street. You heard me."
Thirty-nine years ago, when Farrar started Worldwide Outreach for Christ opposite what is now the Cup Foods convenience store, the area was strictly Bloods territory, he said. He started reaching out to gang members using his own story: In the 1970s, Farrar made $3,000 a day selling cocaine. He gave his own brother the drugs that killed him, and was beaten within an inch of his life by police mistaking him for somebody else. Nursing a cracked skull, he stayed up 19 hours mainlining cocaine until he thought he was going to die and turned to religion out of sheer desperation.
Church members used to stand on the corner with signs offering passersby prayers. They hosted food giveaways and school supply drives. Neighborhood crime declined over the decades. Young suburbanites moved into the historically Black community, but the gangs never fully disappeared.
"I used to walk up and down this street to buy drugs," said Tracy Gordon, who lived in the neighborhood 17 years and credits the church for her sobriety the past 15. "Drugs on the corner, drugs in the alley, drive-by shootings, this corner was a struggle. Before I was an addict on this corner, now I come back and give my testimony."
When George Floyd died here under the knee of a police officer last summer, the city installed concrete barricades to protect crowds from traffic. Protesters reinforced them with rows of bike racks and angled iron barriers known as Czech hedgehogs, blockading the street for 10 months in hopes of winning 24 demands they penned in a "justice resolution."
Church members say they appreciate the Floyd memorial, but not the occupation.
"I don't understand how that's honoring someone that was murdered right there, by blocking everything off," said Kim Hollman, who drives down the alleys to avoid the activist gatekeepers.
"I don't know the people at the gates. I don't even know where they're from. They pick up our dumpster, take it and block the alley. What are y'all doing?" asked Clyde Willrich. "They supposedly do security around here. They don't mess with the drug dealers and gang members though, but they want to mess with the church. Come on now."
Gunshots pop off at night, Willrich said. People sit in the church parking lot smoking weed. Random cars get stowed there. Tow companies refuse to enter the square, so church members with trucks move the cars themselves.
A few weeks ago, the Sunday after Imez Wright was slain in front of Cup Foods, a man drove up and told them they couldn't have a service because the square was closed, and they'd been "warned."
"I'm not trying to hear all of that," Willrich said. "We've been here too long for people that have no idea where they get their authority from to be telling us what to do."
Farrar watches the trial of Derek Chauvin alone on a laptop in his modest basement office. Footage from the church's security cameras plays constantly on the wall.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, Farrar worries about the future of 38th and Chicago now that the gang is growing again. Like the Black business owners of the square, Farrar said no one asked his congregation's consent before turning 38th and Chicago into a "gated community."
Richard Lee, a Chicago transplant who used to be part of the Gangster Disciples, sought religious intervention from Worldwide Outreach for Christ after drinking and crashing his car one night in a nearly fatal accident. He encourages the younger men on the east side of 38th and Chicago to step away from the corner and come to church. They rarely have the patience to hear him out, he said. He just hopes they'll remember the offer when they hit rock bottom.
"What I can see in those young men -- because I was once upon a time doing the same thing -- is they're hurt," Lee said. "You got a lot of pressure on you from your friends in the streets."
When the weather is good, the church has services outside. Rain or shine, it has hosted cookouts and a healing circle every Saturday of the trial.
Not all of the church's parishioners have troubled pasts. But the pastor has a way of bringing in people with trauma, said Hakim Cook-Bey, a former Vice Lords member who grew up in Chicago and fled to Minneapolis before finding a measure of inner peace from the church.
"If it wasn't for Pastor Curtis, I wouldn't be where I'm at, changed. I'm never going back to prison. I can't change my past, but God has changed my future," he said.
Cook-Bey isn't watching the trial. He's seen many Black men killed by police with nothing done until it's politically necessary, he said. He's more concerned about the neighborhood, and the barricades that give "sanctuary" to the gang.
"This area has been under gang violence for way before George Floyd," he said. "But the church has held its ground. We're going to keep speaking against injustice."

Floyd died 'in a vise,' doctor says: Knee pin starved him of oxygen, expert testifies.

Full text: Even after George Floyd took his final breath and went motionless under Derek Chauvin's knee, the since-fired Minneapolis police officer kept the pressure on for another three minutes and 27 seconds, a Chicago-based lung and critical care expert testified Thursday.
Dr. Martin Tobin, a Chicago physician who has written textbooks and specialized in respiratory and critical care medicine for decades, showed through graphics and video how Floyd pressed the fingers of his cuffed right hand to the ground and his knuckles against a police squad-car tire as he fought in vain to open up his side to pull air into his right lung.
"Mr. Floyd died from a low level of oxygen," Tobin said. "This caused damage to his brain that we see, and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop."
Floyd's cause of death remains at the heart of the case. Prosecutors used two out-of-state experts Thursday to bolster their argument that Floyd died because he couldn't breathe while handcuffed on his stomach, pinned under the body weight of Chauvin, who was aided by former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane.
In his cross-examinations, defense attorney Eric Nelson again worked to show that Floyd could have died from a heart attack or overdose caused by illicit drug use and underlying health problems, including arterial blockages. When prosecutor Jerry Blackwell asked Tobin if Floyd's pre-existing
health conditions had anything to do with his death, the doctor replied, "none whatsoever."
Prosecutors are expected to call Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker on Friday. He performed the autopsy on Floyd, ruling the cause of death to be "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." He also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were also found in Floyd's system.
Chauvin is on trial for second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other fired officers -- Kueng, Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled for trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting him. Thao held off the bystanders while the others restrained Floyd.
Tobin showed jurors how Chauvin and Kueng manipulated Floyd's handcuffs high on his back while pinning him. "It's like the left side is in a vise, it's being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated â€¦ totally interferes with central features of how we breathe," he said.
Tobin said Floyd lifted his right shoulder to create chest space to draw breath. "Basically, on the left side of his chest â€¦ it's as if a surgeon almost went in and removed the lung â€¦ and left him totally reliant on his right side," the doctor said.
In one photo, Tobin pointed out how the knuckles on Floyd's right hand braced the ground. "To most people, this doesn't look terribly significant, but to a physiologist this is extraordinarily significant, because this shows he has used up all his resources and showed he is trying to breathe with his fingers and knuckles."
With his left lung useless, the doctor said Floyd was trying to pull air into his right side. Another photo showed Floyd's knuckles on the tire as he tried to open his chest. "This is his only way to get air into the right lung," Tobin said.
The knee on Floyd's neck also restricted his airway to a space narrower than a small straw, Tobin said.
Tobin turned his attention to the amount of weight being pressed onto Floyd's neck. He noted that Chauvin kept his upper body erect, his knee on Floyd's neck and his toe lifted, increasing the weight pressed on Floyd's neck from about 86 pounds to more than 91.
Tobin described the moment he believes Floyd suffered brain damage as evidenced by how Floyd extended his leg in a kick about 5 minutes into the restraint. The video showed Floyd's leg rising and Lane's hand pushing it back down.
Tobin, whose speech carried the lilt of his native Ireland, often spoke directly to the jury and demonstrated on himself how to feel the anatomy of the neck. Many jurors joined him, feeling their own necks.
But his testimony involved some of the most painful video viewing of the trial now in its second week of testimony. Tobin said Floyd lapsed into unconsciousness shortly before 8:25 p.m. on May 25 when his oxygen levels plummeted. Floyd stopped breathing 23 seconds later.
As a slowed-down bystander video was shown of Floyd's face, Tobin described Floyd's death.
"You can see slight flickering and then it disappears, so one second he's alive and one second he's no longer," Tobin said. "That's the moment the life goes out of his body."
After Floyd's breathing ceased, the doctor said that Chauvin's "knee remained on the neck for another 3 minutes and 27 seconds."
Tobin noted that one video showed Kueng checking Floyd for a pulse and saying he didn't find one. From that moment, the doctor said he determined that Chauvin's knee remained on Floyd for another 2 minutes and 44 seconds.
Tobin, who is based at Hines VA hospital in Chicago and Loyola University, added, "The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing; small breaths â€¦ that weren't able to carry the air through his lungs down to the essential areas of the lungs that get oxygen into the blood and get rid of the carbon dioxide."
Under cross examination, Nelson's questioning prompted Tobin to acknowledge that he based some of his scientific conclusions on a number of assumptions, given that no one was at the scene to take various measurements, including Chauvin's net weight with his gear and Floyd's breathing patterns.
Tobin countered that his calculations "are based on direct evidence, they are based on research [and] very few assumptions."
Nelson asked Tobin about the 70 to 90% blockage found in Floyd's coronary arteries and whether that may have been a contributing factor in his death.
Tobin said if it was a contributor, Floyd would have complained of chest pain and had a rapid respiratory rate, but he did not. Nelson also pointed out that Floyd had no bruising on the neck, despite Chauvin's actions.
Blackwell also seized on Nelson getting Tobin to agree that fentanyl can be deadly. Tobin told Blackwell that a fentanyl user who dies first lapses into a coma. Floyd did not.
Unlike many experts called to testify, Tobin said he is not being paid. He said he has testified in dozens of malpractice cases, but this is his first time as a witness in a criminal proceeding. He said the prosecution approached him about testifying, and he agreed because, "I thought I might have some knowledge to explain how Mr. Floyd died."
Another later witness supported much of what Tobin said. Dr. Bill Smock, the police surgeon of the Louisville Police Department, said he was being paid $300 an hour and had spent about 10 hours reviewing videos from Floyd's arrest and other case records.
Smock also concluded that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen and not a fentanyl overdose. Smock said that people who overdose on fentanyl become sleepy, snore, have constricted pupils and their breathing rate falls. With Floyd, Smock said "that is not a fentanyl overdose. That is someone begging to breathe."
Smock said Floyd also showed no signs at the scene of a diagnosis called excited delirium, in which someone afflicted grows extremely hot, moves about rapidly and exhibits superhuman strength.
During the afternoon, jurors heard from a forensic toxicologist at NMS Labs, which tested Flood's blood for illicit drug use and found fentanyl and methamphetamine.
David Isenschmid said that while fentanyl was found in Floyd's blood, so was norfentanyl, which is metabolized fentanyl. Overdose victims who die rarely have norfentanyl in their blood, he said.
He testified that Floyd's ratio of fentanyl to norfentanyl was 1.96 nanograms per milliliter. This is compared with the average ratio of 9.05 ng/ml in postmortem cases and 3.2 ng/ml in driving under the influence cases of people who survive. Floyd's level of methamphetamine was even lower compared to a sample of driving under the influence meth cases.
"Does this show Mr. Floyd was below the average and even below the median in DUI cases?" prosecutor Erin Eldridge asked. "Yes," he said.

"At the beginning you can see he's conscious, you can see slight fl ickering and then it disappears, so one second he's alive and one second he's no longer. ... That's the moment the life goes out of his body."
Dr. Martin Tobin, the prosecution's medical expert, said the pressure on George Floyd's neck and airway kept him from drawing enough breath to stay alive. "Floyd died from a low level of oxygen," Tobin said. "This caused damage to his brain that we see, and it also caused a [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop."

Nonprofit's attorneys help demystify Chauvin trial

Full text: The Legal Rights Center, a nonprofit criminal defense law firm in Minneapolis, usually defends those whom Minneapolis police accuse of committing crimes.
But as Derek Chauvin stands trial for the death of George Floyd, a panel of the firm's attorneys are now finding themselves scrutinizing the defense of a police officer.
The proceedings are the first opportunity many people have had to watch a murder trial from gavel to gavel, with all its graphic evidence, legal jargon and esoteric codes of conduct.
The Legal Rights Center has been demystifying the proceedings through weekly virtual discussions, making lawyers available on Zoom and Instagram.
In addition to explaining court procedures during a weekly "ask-an-attorney" Q&A the center hosts, they note possible key points in the trial.
How Chauvin comes across to jurors could be crucial, for instance, particularly if his attorney Eric Nelson puts him on the stand, said Andrew Gordon, the center's deputy director of community legal services.
Nelson has been asking witnesses about the number of bystanders and the level of their agitation toward Chauvin as he restrained Floyd, Gordon pointed out, as a possible defense.
"You're getting questions about distraction, and about the crowd, because if Chauvin took the stand and testified himself, that's what you will be hearing him say," Gordon said. "From a purely defense attorney perspective, it's an interesting kind of tactical consideration, where you can see Eric Nelson and his defense team trying to figure out, 'Is this argument working?' "
Legal Rights Center attorney Josh Esmay, a former Ramsey County public defender, hosted an Instagram Live Q&A following opening statements.
To a question from the audience about the significance of the order of witnesses, he explained the most effective testimonies come when jurors' attention is strongest: the beginning and the end of trial.
"The last witness that you'll see the state call before they close â€¦ will also be somebody who they have the kind of high confidence will be able to really capture the attention of the jury and give an impactful performance," Esmay said.
In addition to discussing strategy, attorneys offer personal observations and opinions on the trial:
Activist and attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong pointed out that Chauvin did not seem affected by any of the witness testimonies, nor the barrage of videos replaying Floyd's arrest from different angles.
"We still don't know who Derek Chauvin actually is. I'm not sure if we'll know by the end of this trial," she said, remarking on Chauvin's perceived impassivity throughout the proceedings. "Typically we see the demonization of Black children and Black families and Black neighborhoods. Derek Chauvin certainly holds up a mirror to white America, to cause you to ask the question of, 'What kind of people are being produced in some of these environments?' "
Mary Moriarty, the former chief public defender in Hennepin County, questioned whether Nelson had fully prepared his client to present to jurors, who would be watching him all the time. Sometimes defense attorneys will engage their clients in conversation to show the jury evidence of their humanity, but there hasn't been any of that, she said.
The Legal Rights Center is also hosting healing circles for members of the public to emotionally process the trial, and devising a legal response to potential arrests of protesters in coming weeks.
"We want to make sure that folks on the ground who are out exercising their constitutional rights are protected to the degree possible," said Legal Rights Center director Sarah Davis. "Obviously you can't control for law enforcement behavior, but â€¦ we can make sure people know what their rights are, and that they have access to a legal support line."

Pill in squad had meth, fentanyl and Floyd's DNA: Separately, a witness said Derek Chauvin deliberately inflicted pain.

Full text: George Floyd's DNA, fentanyl and methamphetamine showed up in the forensic analysis of a pill recovered from the second search of the Minneapolis police squad Floyd briefly entered May 25 before dying on the street outside Cup Foods, investigators testified Wednesday.
Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's defense hinges largely on the assertion that Floyd died not from asphyxiation under the officer's knee but from an overdose of illicit drugs, underlying health problems or a combination of both.
The testimony Wednesday afternoon pivoted toward the presence of drugs as three forensic scientists testified for the prosecution about the technical process of gathering and testing evidence from Floyd's Mercedes SUV and Minneapolis police squad 320. The latter is the vehicle former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane were attempting to place Floyd in when Chauvin and his partner Tou Thao arrived at the scene at S. Chicago Avenue and E. 38th Street. Also on the stand was state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) special agent James Reyerson, who talked about investigating the scene and reviewed video. The day's testimony started as it had ended late Tuesday, with prosecutor Steve Schleicher's questioning of the state's paid use-of-force witness, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jody Stiger.
Chauvin is on trial for second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other fired officers are to go on trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting him. The trial is at the midpoint of the second week of testimony.
For the first time, the Hennepin County District Court jury heard about the two BCA searches of the two main vehicles at the scene. The first search of the vehicles occurred May 27, two days after Floyd's death. Floyd's Mercedes was searched again in December and the police vehicle again in January.
In her first searches of both, BCA forensic scientist McKenzie Anderson said she was not told to look for drug evidence and none was recovered.
Photographs of the police squad on May 27 showed what appeared to be a white pill on the floor of the rear passenger seat. But Anderson said she did not collect the item because "at the time, I didn't have any information that I was looking for a pill. â€¦ I wasn't sure what it was, or if it came off of somebody's shoe, so at the time I didn't give it any forensic significance based on the information that I had [and was] focusing on the blood that was on the back seat."
She searched Floyd's SUV a second time on the request of the attorney general's office. The defense requested the second search of the police vehicle.
After the second search of the squad in January, DNA from one of the pills in saliva was tested against a known sample of Floyd's DNA and it proved a match, Anderson said. The blood samples from the back of the police squad also proved to match Floyd's DNA profile, Anderson said.
The second BCA search of Floyd's SUV in December led to the recovery of two small white pills from the center console and from the floor on the driver's side a box for Suboxone, "a prescription medication used for adults with an opioid addiction," Anderson said. Authorities seized an unopened packet of the drug, as well.
Prosecutor Matthew Frank led Anderson through a series of questions and photographs aimed at showing how the vehicles had been processed and the evidence protected between the two searches. Both vehicles were sealed with tape that was signed and dated, and then stored in a secure, locked facility, she said.
After Anderson, Breahna Giles, a chemical forensic scientist for the BCA, testified that the pills found inside Floyd's SUV contained methamphetamine and fentanyl, an addictive opioid. A partial pill from the squad and other traces of it tested positive for methamphetamine. Another substance was detected, but there was not enough of it to conclusively identify it, she said.
A glass pipe from the SUV also tested positive for THC, the active substance in marijuana, Giles said.
Susan Neith, a forensic chemist at NMS labs in Pennsylvania, provided more specificity on the composition of the pills.
She tested the two pills found in the SUV and the partial pill found in the squad. All three pills contained a fentanyl concentration of less than 1%, which she said is common. The pills contained a methamphetamine concentration of 1.9% to 2.9%, which she said was well below the 90% to 100% methamphetamine usually found, she said.
Floyd's possible drug consumption also arose during defense attorney Eric Nelson's cross-examination of Reyerson.
Nelson played a clip from Kueng's body camera and asked Reyerson if it sounded like Floyd said, " 'I ate too many drugs' " as he was pinned to the ground.
Reyerson said yes, but minutes later, Frank played a longer clip and Reyerson changed his interpretation, saying he believed Floyd was saying, "I ain't do no drugs."
Through Reyerson, the prosecution sought to show that Chauvin kept his weight on Floyd long after he had stopped speaking or moving. He testified that Chauvin's knee went on Floyd's neck at 8:19 p.m.
Reyerson said Floyd fell silent at 8:24 p.m. and stopped moving a minute later. Chauvin's weight was still on Floyd more than 2Â½ minutes later, when paramedics arrived, Reyerson confirmed.
The special agent also detailed the beginnings of his investigation at City Hall where he took a full-body photograph of Chauvin, which was shown to the jury. Reyerson testified that Chauvin weighed 140 pounds with an additional 30-40 pounds coming from his equipment belt and vest.
In his cross-examination of Reyerson, Nelson also sought to dispel the notion that the stream of liquid on the street visible in bystander video was urine expelled by Floyd as he lay dying. Reyerson acknowledged it could have been condensation from the nearby squad car that continued to run.
In his second day on the stand, Stiger claimed that Chauvin was intentionally inflicting pain on Floyd as a means to control him. Chauvin appeared to use "pain compliance" by squeezing fingers or bringing knuckles together.
Stiger testified that the risks of positional asphyxia are well-established and that even without Chauvin's body weight, Floyd would have been in danger.
As other witnesses have testified, Stiger said the officers had a duty to care for Floyd whose health and breathing were deteriorating.
In his cross-examination, Nelson pressed the "totality of the circumstances" standard for analyzing force. He pushed the argument that Chauvin was working in a chaotic, quickly changing environment while struggling with a powerful, unpredictable suspect who wasn't following commands.
Nelson noted that when Chauvin arrived at the scene, he knew the other officers were struggling with a suspect who was possibly high on drugs and up to 6Â½ feet tall.
The defense attorney worked to point out the contradictory words and actions of Floyd, who had a foamy substance coming from his mouth but denied taking drugs.
And Floyd kept saying "I can't breathe" but at the same time "he was actively resisting being put in the back of the squad car," Nelson said.
He also brought up the agitated crowd, including the words and actions of witness Donald Williams, the most vocal curbside witness, who was captured on video pacing and swearing at the officers.
As for Chauvin continuing to keep Floyd pinned to the pavement and cuffed, Nelson said an officer needs time to determine what to do next.
Stiger responded that "even when they are resisting, you want to put them in a side recovery position or sit them up" as soon as possible in order to avoid creating a threat to a suspect's life.

Full text: Minneapolis voters will decide this fall on whether to change the balance of power in City Hall, granting the mayor more authority over daily operations and restricting the council's role.
The Minneapolis Charter Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to place the question before voters in November, when the ballot will include the races for mayor and all 13 City Council members. The ballot also could have a separate proposal to replace the Police Department.
"I think it's probably the most important charter amendment that's come before the city in 100 years," said Barry Clegg, chairman of the commission. "If somebody has 14 bosses, things don't get done, conflicts don't get resolved and that's what we learned when we talked to our department heads. Hopefully, this will make a difference."
The decision comes eight months after the commission temporarily blocked a City Council proposal that would have replaced the Police Department in the wake of George Floyd's death and given council members more sway over officers. Later this spring, it will review another similar proposal.
Minneapolis leaders have debated for at least a century how to best govern the city. Many current elected officials acknowledge city government isn't functioning as efficiently as it could, but some doubt the commission's proposal will actually lead to improvements.
The Charter Commission is made up of volunteers chosen by a judge to oversee the city's charter, essentially its constitution. "Ultimately, we should seek to have a system where people have a voice in their government," said City Council President Lisa Bender, who is not running for re-election. "I am very skeptical that the Charter Commission's proposal will achieve that."
She, like some others on the council, has argued that the city's ward system is crucial for ensuring that people who live in areas with lower voter turnout have representation in City Hall.
Eight people running for city offices this year, including mayoral candidate Sheila Nezhad, wrote an open letter raising similar concerns.
Other elected officials appeared to welcome the change.
While he stopped shy of a full endorsement, Mayor Jacob Frey told commissioners in a public meeting earlier this year that he thought the city would benefit from clarifying the roles of the mayor and council.
"There is no reason that any business or government would voluntarily and independently set themselves up in a way that we presently are," he said at the time.
The Charter Commission's work to change the city's power structure gained new traction last year after it reviewed -- and ultimately blocked -- a City Council proposal that would have replaced the Police Department and given council members more sway over officers.
The city's department heads told commissioners in private interviews that they struggled to respond effectively to crises like the coronavirus pandemic and the rioting that followed George Floyd's death because it was difficult to manage conflicts between the city's 14 elected officials.
When the elected leaders disagreed, it often was hard to determine whose opinion prevailed, the department heads said.
Under the new proposal, the council would focus primarily on legislative duties like writing ordinances and vetting city budgets. It would retain sway over the clerk's office and auditor to support its legislative and oversight functions.
The mayor would serve as the "chief executive" for most of the largest departments, including police, fire and public works, among others. Council members would not be permitted to "usurp, invade, or interfere with the mayor's direction or supervision." The commission jettisoned a controversial, earlier provision that would have made it a crime to violate that clause.
The proposal also changes the terms of many city department heads to align them with the mayor's and it raises the number of votes required to remove an elected official from office to a two-thirds majority.
"I would say that under the current system, we have a mayor who has the responsibility but no authority, and a council that has the authority but no responsibility," Clegg said. "We're trying to resolve that quandary."
The commissioners plan to spend the next month wrapping up work drafting the ordinance that must accompany their proposal.
It then will head to the City Council and to Frey. The elected officials can determine what wording appears on the ballot but they can't change the underlying proposal itself.
As the commissioners are wrapping up work on this proposal, a smaller subset of them will be reviewing a separate plan, written by three City Council members, to replace the city's Police Department. In its place, the city would have a public safety department that includes police officers, though the city would no longer be required to keep a minimum number of them.
The Charter Commission will provide a recommendation on the plan, which requires approval from voters, but the mayor and council will make the final decision about whether it appears on the ballot.
Commissioner Andrea Rubenstein, who is leading the commission's efforts to review the proposal, said they could provide a recommendation as early as next month.

Trainers fault Chauvin tactics: He should have let up with Floyd on ground, experts say.

Full text: A Los Angeles-based use-of-force expert and Minneapolis Police Department trainers testified Tuesday that former officer Derek Chauvin went too far with his restraint of George Floyd.
Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Jody Stiger testified that he had reviewed the case and found Chauvin's force to be "excessive" in arresting Floyd on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at Cup Foods at 38th and Chicago on May 25.
"Initially, when Mr. Floyd was being placed in the back seat of the vehicle, the officers were justified in trying to have him comply and sit in the back seat of the vehicle," Stiger said. "However, once he was placed in the prone position on the ground, he slowly ceased his resistance and the officers -- or ex-officers I should say -- should have slowed down or stopped their force."
The defendant's lawyer, Eric Nelson, pressed the claim that a hostile crowd distracted Chauvin and prevented a proper diagnosis or
aid. The defense attorney also used cross-examination to argue that in some instances, Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's shoulders, not on his neck, and that maneuver complies with department training.
Stiger's testimony was truncated when Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill abruptly adjourned an hour earlier than usual Tuesday. Questioning by the prosecution is to resume Wednesday.
Three more Minneapolis police officers also took the stand Wednesday, bringing the total to eight current or former officers who have testified on the prosecution's behalf.
Lt. Johnny Mercil, who was in charge of the MPD's use-of-force training but is on medical leave, was shown a photo from the viral bystander video of Floyd pleading for his life under Chauvin's knee and asked if the tactic was trained.
"No, sir," Mercil said.
Prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked, "If the subject was under control and handcuffed, would this be authorized?" Mercil responded, "I would say no."
Nelson had yet to cross-examine Stiger, but through his questioning of the other prosecution witnesses Tuesday, he seeded the notions that Floyd died from a drug overdose, not asphyxiation from Chauvin's restraint and that the hostile bystanders distracted the officer, preventing him from realizing Floyd's distress and saving him.
Nelson also offered a series of photographs from Officer Thomas Lane's body camera. Lane and his partner J. Alexander Kueng were the first on the scene last year. They were also fired and are scheduled for trial in August.
Mercil agreed the images showed Chauvin's knee and shin on Floyd's shoulder area. After viewing those photos, Nelson asked Mercil, "Does this appear to be a neck restraint?" Mercil said, "No."
In one image of Floyd on the ground, paramedic Derek Smith's gloved fingers can be seen touching Floyd's carotid artery, checking for a pulse. Nelson asked Mercil if the paramedic would have been able to touch the artery if Chauvin's knee were on it. Mercil said, "No, sir."
Nelson also raised general questions with Mercil about whether suspects under arrest "at times are making excuses," claiming to suffer from a medical emergency by declaring " 'I can't breathe' " to avoid going to jail. The lieutenant said yes.
As part of his initial direct questioning of Mercil, Schleicher had the lieutenant describe the department's use-of-force policies. Mercil said minimal force needed should be used. "If you can use a lower level of force to meet your objectives, it's safer and better for everybody," he said.
Schleicher asked if it was appropriate to hold someone in a "prone position" after the person had stopped resisting arrest or lost their pulse. Mercil said no.
Mercil explained to the jury when two types of neck restraints are allowed. One is used to render a suspect unconscious when he's offering "active aggression," Mercil said. Another is used to counter "active resistance" and keeps the subject conscious, Mercil said.
The prosecution also called on Stiger, who has been with the Los Angeles department since 1993 and said he had conducted more than 2,500 use-of-force reviews. Stiger disclosed that he was paid a $10,000 "flat fee" and a $2,950 "trial fee" by the state to look at the incident. Stiger said he determined Chauvin's force on Floyd to be "excessive."
Typically, in the case of someone suspected of passing a counterfeit bill, Stiger said force would not be used.
Schleicher replayed video of the officers working to control Floyd in the back seat of a squad as he claimed to be claustrophobic. He highlighted that at one point on the video, Floyd resisted by trying to kick away an officer. The prosecutor asked Stiger if he saw any other acts by Floyd that would constitute "aggressive behavior." Stiger said no.
Nicole Mackenzie, the department's medical support coordinator and first aid educator, testified to two prosecution points: that police can begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before paramedics arrive and that just because someone can talk, it doesn't mean they are breathing properly.
But when Nelson pressed, she acknowledged that chaotic scenes can hinder a first responder's ability to provide aid.
"If you're trying to be heads-down on a patient that you need to render aid to, it's very difficult to focus on that patient while there's other things around you," she said.
Nelson also asked whether agonal breathing -- or involuntary gasps sometimes made by people under cardiac arrest -- could be confused with regular breathing. She said that yes, it can.
When Schleicher questioned her directly a second time, he asked whether agitated onlookers excuse an officer from rendering aid.
"Only if they were physically getting themselves involved," Mackenzie said.
At the scene of Floyd's arrest, bystanders grew loud in their pleadings and sometimes used profanity, but they never physically threatened Chauvin or the other officers, according to witnesses and video.
Also testifying was Sgt. Ker Yang, who helps train officers who encounter people in crisis. Although Yang was never directly asked about Chauvin's actions, he said he trains officers to "bring them back down."
"When it is safe and feasible, we shall de-escalate," Yang said.
Before the jury arrived Tuesday, lawyers argued over whether Morries L. Hall could be compelled to testify about any aspect of his relationship with Floyd.
Hall, who was in the car with Floyd and whom one witness said sold him illegal drugs, has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Hall's lawyer Adrienne Cousins said his testimony would put him at risk for a third-degree murder charge in Floyd's death.
"I cannot envision any topics Mr. Hall would be called to testify on that would be relevant to the case that would not incriminate him," Cousins said.
Cahill left open the possibility he could testify about Floyd's behavior. The judge directed Nelson to submit possible written questions for Hall by Thursday for further discussion.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd. Three other fired officers, Kueng, Lane and Tou Thao, are scheduled to be tried in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.

Floyd family braces for difficult testimony

Full text: More than two dozen of George Floyd's family members have converged in Minneapolis to watch the murder trial of the former police officer charged in his death and they're bracing themselves for the difficult testimony and images expected to come later this week when his cause of death and autopsy are examined.
"We pray a lot and we talk about different things that we might see in court," said his brother, Philonise Floyd. "So we know that autopsies are getting ready to show, so we're prepping each other."
Philonise Floyd, his wife Keeta Floyd and the family's attorney, Benjamin Crump, sat down for an interview Tuesday evening amid the second week of testimony in Derek Chauvin's trial. They discussed the emotional toll of rewatching Floyd die pinned under Chauvin's knee in a bystander's video that has been played several times in court. They expressed confidence in the prosecution's case, and they rejected any interest in the state negotiating a plea deal with Chauvin.
"The family wants him to be held accountable in the court of law to the full extent," Crump said, adding that he is not aware of any plea negotiations between the prosecution and Chauvin. "This case of Derek Chauvin regarding the killing of George Floyd is exactly like Philonise said -- America's on trial. Is it just rhetoric, or, do we really live by what we project to the world -- liberty and justice and equality â€¦ for all?"
Chauvin is on trial for second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other former police officers who were at the scene of Floyd's May 25 arrest -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.
Philonise and Keeta Floyd and other family members have taken turns sitting in the one seat reserved in the courtroom for Floyd's relatives. Social-distancing protocols have limited the number of people who can attend. Relatives also watch the trial on a live feed broadcast to another room in the courthouse.
They said the family is committed to showing up every day regardless of the trauma they must bear.
"Every time you go into the courtroom you see your brother passing away over and over again," Philonise Floyd said. "It's like djÂ  vu. You see the same thing. It's a lot of pain, a lot of agony. I'm sitting there and I just -- you know, I can't save him. You constantly see him scream â€¦ I teared up lots of times."
Asked about the dynamics of the case, Keeta Floyd was quick to fire off the full names of witnesses from memory and the impact of their testimony.
"Keeta sounds like a lawyer," Crump joked, prompting everyone to break into smiles and laughter. But the lightness was fleeting among the conversations about seeing Chauvin in person and meeting some of the witnesses.
Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. Kueng knelt on his back and Lane knelt and held onto his legs. Thao held off bystanders who pleaded with the officers to relent and check for a pulse.
"He just seems like he has no remorse," Keeta Floyd said about seeing Chauvin in the courtroom. "He's just there."
"It's terrible sitting in there watching him knowing he's out on bond," Philonise Floyd said. "â€¦ I think he should be incarcerated right now."
They said several witnesses came by to see the family briefly after being on the stand.
Judeah Reynolds, who was 9 when she witnessed the incident, interacted with Floyd's daughter, and witness Donald Williams II stopped by briefly to see the family, Crump said.
Jena Scurry, the 911 dispatcher who was so troubled by what she saw of the arrest being broadcast in real time on a city security camera that she reported it to the officers' supervisor that night, walked by, Crump added.
"She had tears in her eyes," he said. "She just acknowledged that she did all she could."
"I'm just happy that they had a voice, that they came out and they spoke, because they didn't have to do it," Philonise Floyd said of the testimony.
Philonise said he was moved by the testimony of 61-year-old Charles McMillian, a witness who tried to intervene and who was so overcome by sobs on the witness stand that court was briefly recessed. "Every time he dropped one tear, I dropped two to three," Philonise Floyd said. "It was just terrible just watching him."
Floyd's family and Crump said they believe the prosecution has put on a strong case and they were not concerned about competing theories on the cause of death or the prosecution bringing in an outside pathologist to supplement the findings of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner.
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd died of a drug overdose and pre-existing health issues, including heart disease. The prosecution has said its outside expert will testify that Floyd died of asphyxia despite the county medical examiner's ruling that he died of cardiac arrest. Both ruled the death a homicide, a death that occurs at the hands of another person.
The family and Crump said strong testimony from key police leaders, including chief Medaria Arradondo, the bystander video and the length of time Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck are too strong to overlook.
"The nation is watching, and they want Chauvin to be convicted," Philonise Floyd said. "I'm hopin' and I have faith that we will get justice. This is a monumental case. A case of this magnitude, everybody around the world is waitin' and they want to know what's going on."

Full text: Sometime around noon on the day after George Floyd died while pleading for breath under a police officer's knee, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo summoned his top staff to a meeting in his office.
He told them that he was leaning toward firing the officer, Derek Chauvin, and three of his colleagues who were involved in Floyd's arrest, but that he wanted a second opinion before any decision, according to interviews and documents describing the nature of the meeting obtained by the Star Tribune.
After wrestling with the "weighty" and "emotional" choice, they all agreed that the officers had to go, a decision that Arradondo announced to the world later that afternoon in a news conference outside of City Hall.
In terminating the officers less than 24 hours after Floyd's death, Arradondo moved more quickly and decisively than his predecessors, who in some cases waited weeks or months to discipline officers for alleged misconduct -- and even then only after intense public pressure.
"They all unequivocally agreed that, that was the right decision to do," Arradondo said in a recorded interview with agents from the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the FBI. "I don't want to surround myself with 'yes people' and I did tell them this is, and it was a weighty, weighty decision. And it was an emotional decision."
Before the meeting, Arradondo had sought the advice of community leaders like Spike Moss, a local civil rights pioneer.
Moss said in an interview that the chief had always shown a willingness to consult with various groups before making major decisions.
"We were working on the changes that had been necessary way before George Floyd died," he said.
Taking the witness stand Monday in the murder trial of Chauvin, Arradondo testified that one of his deputy chiefs called him at home last May 25 to tell him about the encounter with Floyd -- who hadn't yet been pronounced dead -- prompting Arradondo to contact Mayor Jacob Frey before heading to City Hall, where he watched footage from a city-owned camera. He said in the interview with BCA and FBI agents several weeks after Floyd's death that the gravity of what happened didn't sink in until after he watched the now infamous Facebook video of Floyd saying that he couldn't breathe after three officers got on top of him. It was then that Arradondo made the decision to contact the FBI to investigate the case, he told the agents.
He told the agents that he spent the next several hours reaching out to Black faith leaders and community activists to inform them of what happened, recognizing that "by sunrise this was going to ignite a lot of emotion," according to documents describing the interview.
Bishop Richard Howell, of Shiloh Temple International Ministries, said that he and other leaders met with Arradondo around 10 a.m. on May 26, the day after Floyd died, when the chief told them he was torn about what to do. Arradondo described the footage to those who hadn't seen it, Howell said, and "shared his concerns about the video, about what actually happened."
An FBI official in attendance raised the possibility of a civil rights investigation, Howell recalled, to which someone in the room questioned whether Floyd's death was "a matter of civil rights or human rights."
He said at one point the mayor joined the meeting and the conversation briefly turned to the best course of action after people in the community saw the video. Some speakers asked about the city's readiness for the possibility of protests.
"Now at the time, the word 'murder,' 'killing,' that wasn't really tossed around, but also it was a matter of concern because we knew the city would not receive this well," Howell said. "An activist who was in the room told us that there was going to be a 'war.' "
Others in the room included prominent activists such as Nekima Levy Armstrong, Al Flowers and former Minneapolis NAACP President Leslie Redmond.
Another attendee, Steven Belton, president and CEO of the Urban League Twin Cities, said in an interview that at some point the meeting turned into a question-and-answer session, as he and others pressed Arradondo on whether he intended to fire the officers for their conduct.
He said the chief listened patiently and tried to answer their questions. Belton said Arradondo told them that he would talk his options over with Frey, who as mayor is in charge of the Police Department but doesn't have the authority to fire individual officers.
Among the many considerations facing Arradondo was weighing the potential fallout from firing the officers so quickly after the incident, Belton said.
"I think it was extraordinarily courageous for him to do that, but I also don't think that it was based on community pressure -- it was based on personal conviction," he said of Arradondo's decision, while also crediting Frey for backing his chief.
Around midday, Arradondo huddled in his office with members of his senior command staff: then-Assistant Chief Mike Kjos, and Deputy Chiefs Kathy Waite, Henry Halvorson and Erick Fors; Art Knight, Arradondo's former chief of staff, was out of town, and joined the meeting by phone.
In his later interview with the BCA and the FBI, Arradondo recalled that he hadn't yet made his final decision, but asked the officials gathered about what they thought about firing Chauvin and the other three officers, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, the documents said.
He said that by then it had dawned on him that Floyd's death was "going to be a significant incident for the city," according to the documents.
"We â€¦ had to do the right thing based on the information we had, but we also knew that this was going to really change the image of the department."
Arradondo said that after reaching his decision, he called the mayor to tell him. By 2 p.m. Frey tweeted news of the officers' firings, writing: "This is the right call."
Around the same time, Arradondo and Frey made it public at a news conference, where a clearly shaken Frey was more unequivocal, saying, "Being Black in America should not be a death sentence."
"We not only knew that we were, we had to do the right thing based on the information we had," Arradondo said, according to the documents. "That, of all the great things and all of the good things that this department has done, this one singular horrific incident was going to [be significant] and by the way, this is days before the riots."

Full text: Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo's unequivocal and historic testimony condemning now-former officer Derek Chauvin's actions that led to George Floyd's death is seen by some veteran lawyers as a fresh crack in the longstanding "blue wall" code of silence by police.
"What could be the possible interest in the police trying to defend that?" civil rights attorney Al Goins said. "Their best defense as a department is to try to say this is wrong, this is not who we are, and that's not who we want to be in the future."
Arradondo spent most of Monday on the witness stand, recounting in detail how he learned of Floyd's death, and how Chauvin's conduct was out of step with department policies at nearly every turn.
In calm, clear testimony regarding the force being used on the handcuffed Floyd, the chief called Chauvin's conduct a violation of policy and training and said it "is certainly not part of our ethics or values."
It is incredibly rare for a police chief to take the stand against one of his own former officers, so Arradondo's remarks immediately ricocheted around social media and were rebroadcast on TV news outlets across the country in one of the most extraordinary moments of the trial. But his comments also took on broader implications for a department whose culture has long discouraged officers from criticizing a colleague's conduct -- at least publicly.
Chauvin faces murder and manslaughter charges, while the two officers who held Floyd's back and legs, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, and a third officer who stood guard, Tou Thao, have each been charged with aiding and abetting murder.
Some watching the trial saw Arradondo's testimony, coupled with that of other police witnesses -- homicide Lt. Richard Zimmerman, Sgt. Jon Edwards and David Pleoger, a retired MPD sergeant -- as striking a blow to the "blue wall of silence" that usually protects police wrongdoing.
Goins said the video of Floyd's death made it harder for police officials to defend the actions to the public.
He said he frequently faced resistance when representing victims of police brutality, and not only from fellow officers, but also sheriff's deputies, prosecutors and other criminal justice representatives who tried to cover up bad police behavior.
"In those cases where there were close calls, I think they had no incentive to try to say, 'Nope, we're gonna root this out.' Their incentives operated the other way, to try to close ranks," Goins said.
Arradondo has previously called Floyd's death a "murder."
Some critics on social media said that Arradondo's testimony was self-serving and that by painting his former officer as an outlier, or "bad apple," he was deflecting attention from the aggressive tactics that the department trains its officers on. Others pointed out that Arradondo disciplined an officer who spoke as an anonymous source for a GQ magazine article criticizing the department's "toxic culture."
Last week, Zimmerman, the longest-tenured officer in the department, testified that he saw Chauvin's actions kneeling on Floyd's neck as "totally unnecessary." The longtime homicide chief was among the group of officers who issued a public letter condemning Floyd's killing and pledging to "work with you and for you to regain your trust."
"Like us, Derek Chauvin took an oath to hold the sanctity of life most precious," the letter read. "Derek Chauvin failed as a human and stripped George Floyd of his dignity and life. This is not who we are."
In many ways, the Chauvin case stood in stark contrast to the last major police brutality case in Minneapolis, of now-former officer Mohamed Noor.
In that trial, prosecutors openly complained of officers changing their accounts of what happened on the night Noor shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond while responding to her 911 call. Dozens of officers also refused to come in for voluntary statements, on the advice of their union, prompting prosecutors to take the unusual step of issuing subpoenas to compel their cooperation. Attorneys on both sides of the Chauvin case said in court earlier this year that they faced no such resistance from officers.
The Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which prosecuted Noor, also repeatedly accused the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) of falling short in its investigation of the shooting, including failing to test key evidence and interview certain witnesses.
Relations between the county attorney's office and the union that represents the city's rank-and-file officers soured after the 2018 trial of Efrem Hamilton, a downtown officer who was charged and later acquitted of firing at a car full of teenagers whom he mistook for suspects in a shooting. No one was injured in the incident. But allegations of dishonesty surfaced during that trial, when an assistant county attorney openly questioned whether a veteran homicide detective gave differing accounts of what happened, prompting a defense objection that the prosecutor was being "argumentative" with her own witness.
In 2019, St. Paul officer Brian Ficcadenti described the existence of an unwritten "code of silence" among officers while testifying in the trial of St. Paul officer Brett Palkowitsch, who was charged with violating the civil rights of Frank Baker, kicking him as he was being bitten by a police dog. Ficcadenti told prosecutors that he was reluctant to criticize Palkowitsch because it might invite retaliation from fellow officers for informing on another officer.
At the time of Chauvin's trial, the presiding judge agreed to bar prosecutors from mentioning the existence of "a blue wall of silence," regarding officers' interactions with their union during the investigation -- attorneys for the four since-fired officers on trial for Floyd's death have made a similar request.
The officers' testimony in Chauvin's trial is in line with administrative attempts to shift the culture of policing, both in Minneapolis and elsewhere. Since Floyd's death, several states have passed laws requiring officers to intervene, and not just report, when they encounter another officer using excessive force, including Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nevada and New Jersey. In California, lawmakers last year considered legislation that would criminalize the "blue wall of silence," punishing officers for failing to intervene when witnessing colleagues using potentially excessive force.

Police chief: Chauvin 'should have stopped': Arradondo says force was excessive

Full text: Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testified Monday that fired officer Derek Chauvin used excessive force and defied his own training and the department's mission of compassion when he knelt on George Floyd's neck as Floyd pleaded for his life.
Arradondo's testimony came amid a consistent voice of disapproval from key department leaders that began last week with similar statements from the head of the homicide unit. Testimony wrapped Monday with the department's former head of training, who echoed Arradondo's sentiments.
"Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting -- and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that -- that should have stopped," Arradondo said after recounting department policy on when to use force vs. de-escalation tactics.
"There's an initial reasonableness of trying to just get him under control in the first few seconds," the chief said, "but once there was no longer any resistance, and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to
continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way shape or form is anything that is by policy, part of our training and is certainly not part of our ethics or values."
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, raised several key defenses in his cross-examination of Arradondo, who agreed that officers can use force sometimes to de-escalate a situation, neck restraint techniques were permitted by the department at the time, and handcuffed suspects can inflict harm.
Nelson pointedly asked the chief when he last arrested a suspect.
"It's been many years, sir," Arradondo said.
Under cross-examination, the chief also agreed that department policy affords an officer flexibility between using force and choosing to de-escalate an encounter with someone resisting arrest.
Chauvin is on trial on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's May 25 death.
Prosecutors on Monday also began introducing cause of death evidence through their questioning of the Hennepin County Medical Center doctor who treated Floyd and declared him dead. Dr. Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld, who testified first thing Monday, said that upon arrival Floyd did not have a heartbeat "sufficient to sustain life" and that his cardiac arrest was due to a lack of oxygen.
"Is there another term for that?" asked prosecutor Jerry Blackwell.
"Asphyxia," said Langenfeld, who was a senior medical resident at the time.
Langenfeld testified that Floyd didn't have a pulse but showed some electrical activity.
The cause of death is poised to become a potentially complex and confusing issue for jurors to decipher. Prosecutors plan to prove Floyd died of asphyxiation despite the Hennepin County medical examiner's ruling that he died of "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."
Nelson has argued that Floyd likely died of a drug overdose and pre-existing health issues, including heart disease.
Arradondo testified next, recounting how a deputy chief called him about 9 p.m. last spring to report an arrest that resulted in a civilian being transported to the hospital. The chief said he was told the person was still alive.
Arradondo contacted the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates critical incidents involving police, and Mayor Jacob Frey. He then departed for his office downtown.
The chief said he reviewed city surveillance video of the incident but nothing "jumped out at me," because the video had no audio and because the four officers' backs were turned to the camera located across the street. Floyd was largely obscured by the officers.
It was close to midnight when Arradondo received a call from a community member. "Chief," Arradondo testified he was told, "have you seen the video of your officer choking and killing that man at 38th and Chicago?"
"And so once I heard that statement I just knew it wasn't the same â€¦ video that I saw," Arradondo said.
Minutes later he watched the video recorded by bystander Darnella Frazier, then 17, who is credited by many for prompting the four officers' prosecution by sharing an independent, close-up perspective of the arrest.
Prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked Arradondo if Chauvin's conduct adhered to the department's policy on de-escalation.
"I absolutely do not agree with that, that action is not de-escalation," he said. "When we talk about the framework of our sanctity of life and we talk about the principles and values we have, that action goes contrary to what we're talking about."
The chief's assessment during several hours on the witness stand complemented testimony last week from veteran police Lt. Richard Zimmerman, the head of homicide who called Chauvin's actions "uncalled for."
Nelson underscored the dangers of police work and highlighted Arradondo's remove from street-level policing in his cross-examination. He instructed Arradondo to read part of the department's use-of-force policy and asked if it defined active resistance, in part, as suspects pulling away, hiding their arms or making statements to avoid arrest.
Yes, the chief said.
Nelson has argued that Floyd was resisting arrest and posed a possible safety risk to his client and the other officers at the scene -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. The other three are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23. All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.
"Sometimes an officer has to command the presence; they have to take control of the situation?" Nelson asked, noting that department policy allows the use of a weapon in some circumstances as part of de-escalation.
"Yes," the chief said.
The two went back and forth a few rounds on the same issue when Nelson asked a hypothetical: If an officer decided to use a hobble restraint that binds the ankles to the waist but then backed away from it, would that be moving "backwards down the continuum of use-of-force?"
Yes, the chief eventually said.
The officers at Floyd's arrest had considered using the hobble restraint, which requires calling a supervisor to the scene due to the risk of positional asphyxia, and opted not to.
Nelson also introduced the concept of "camera perspective bias" by playing a clip of Frazier's video that appeared to show Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck and then playing a clip of Kueng's body-worn camera from the same time frame that appeared to show Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's shoulder. He also showed them together in a split screen.
Arradondo testified that the Kueng video showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's shoulder.
On redirect, Schleicher did not challenge the cameras' different perspectives, but asked the chief if Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck up until the several-seconds-long video clips in question, which came at the end of the arrest when paramedics arrived.
Yes, Arradondo said. Schleicher showed him an image taken from Frazier's video that depicted Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. Arradondo said it was not a trained technique at Minneapolis police.
In an attempt to discredit Nelson's argument that angry bystanders posed a safety risk to the officers, Schleicher showed Arradondo the picture again and asked, "Would one way to de-escalate the crowd who's experiencing something shocking [is] to stop doing the thing that's shocking them?"
"Absolutely," the chief said.
"I have nothing further," Schleicher said.
Prosecutors later showed the same picture to Minneapolis police inspector Katie Blackwell, who ran the department's training division until recently.
"I don't know what kind of improvised position that is," she said, "So, it's not what we train."
Court resumes at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday with attorneys and Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill discussing a motion filed by potential witness Morries Hall. Hall was in the car with Floyd outside of Cup Foods when police approached to investigate a reported fake bill.
Hall filed a motion last week invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and asked the court to quash a subpoena requiring him to testify if he is called. Cahill on Monday signed an order allowing Hall to wear civilian clothes instead of jail scrubs for the court appearance. Hall is in custody on an unrelated matter.

Filming police violence has its own trauma

Full text: Darnella Frazier's viral video of George Floyd's final moments showed the world what she happened to see and document on a Minneapolis street last May.
Last week, the world got a glimpse of the trauma that still haunts her because of it.
"There have been nights I stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life," Frazier testified tearfully during former police officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial. "But it's like not what I should have done, it's what he should have done," she said, referring to Chauvin.
Like Frazier, who simply happened to be taking her 9-year-old cousin to the store that evening, other people who have stumbled upon and documented instances of police violence describe recording as the only thing they could do in situations where they felt helpless. Often, they end up encumbered
with guilt, sleepless nights and other mental health concerns.
The experiences witnesses described in court last week are consistent with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, said University of Minnesota psychology Prof. Patricia Frazier. Though many people associate PTSD with combat, it can include witnessing many forms of death and threats.
"That qualifies as a trauma for PTSD. It makes sense that if someone was right there when it happened and filming it, that they would be experiencing trauma symptoms," she said.
Guilt and regret over not doing more to stop Floyd's death could be consistent with "moral injury," when someone feels guilty for not stopping an event that violated their moral code, the professor said.
The first week of testimony in the trial revealed that more people filmed Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis police officers than previously were made public.
High school senior Alyssa Funari, a minor at the time, was also recording that day.
"I felt like there wasn't really anything I could do," she said in emotional testimony. "As a bystander I was powerless there, and I was failing to do anything."
Afterward, Funari said she felt numb, pushing the experience aside because she did not know what to feel.
Ever since George Holliday captured on his new camcorder the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police, video has become integral in raising awareness of police violence across the country.
In 2016, Diamond Reynolds broadcast her boyfriend Philando Castile dying in the front seat of his car after he was shot by a St. Anthony police officer. Reynolds said it is always necessary to pull out your phone to get footage of incidents that could turn deadly.
"I didn't want to be accused of doing anything that caused Phil to get killed. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if that happened," Reynolds said.
It's been difficult for Dae'anna, Reynolds' daughter, who was in the car that night, Reynolds said, adding that the fourth-grader continues to go to therapy.
"She loves leading protests. ... We want her to be a healer to other people who've gone through similar things that she has," Reynolds said.
When police approached Eric Garner and Ramsey Orta in New York City in 2014, Orta knew what to do. He'd been recording his interactions with police for about a year, uploading the videos to YouTube for accountability and his personal safety. But he didn't realize until months later how he had been affected by what he witnessed: his friend dying after an officer put him in a chokehold during an arrest.
"Mentally I wasn't stable, physically I wasn't right, I was losing a lot of weight, I wasn't sleeping," Orta said.
Without the support he got for filming the video, Orta said he is unsure if he would have recovered.
"I was always criticizing myself for not doing enough," Orta said, echoing the guilt witnesses expressed in Minneapolis.
Showing the world what happened to Garner continues to affect Orta daily, he said.
"As many times as I try to forget about this or keep my mind off it, either the TV, the radio or somebody around me or something that I look at just brings it up and brings it right back. I never get away from it," Orta said.
"I can't breathe" -- the words both Garner and Floyd uttered as they lay dying, still disturb Orta.
"I'll be talking to somebody and they'll say, 'I can't breathe.' In an instant, that triggers," he said.
But filming these interactions with police can bring awareness to police brutality, which Orta discusses in the 2017 documentary "Copwatch."
The invention of video makes it more difficult to ignore or invalidate cases of injustice, said Danielle Kilgo, a professor at the U's Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication.
"The portability and the affordability, the adoption of mobile technology really gave people a defense line, especially communities of color, to sort of prove what hadn't been believed by so many people before," she said.
The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma typically provides resources for journalists and photographers who experience trauma, but the center's programs are easily applicable to anybody who has witnessed violence, Kilgo said.
"They want to bear witness to a tragedy, and they know they can't intervene. It's been traumatic for journalists, and it's equally traumatic for citizen journalists who are picking up that role," she said.
Reynolds said she and others pull out their phones because they want to have evidence and they want their stories to be heard, knowing that narratives surrounding police interactions can be manipulated.
"The nastiest and gruesomest thing is taking out a phone and recording somebody as they are being hurt. You want to try to help them," Reynolds said. "But if pulling out your phone is the only way you can try to help, then save yourself by pulling out your phone. Take deep breaths. Don't think about it. Press that button and let it flow."

Full text: WASECA - When Doug Gerdts was growing up on a Waseca County farm, he heard stories about Great-uncle Don. Don Eustice had been the sheriff until he was shot and killed in 1976 while conducting a welfare check.
Gerdts never met his great-uncle, but Eustice was a legend in the boy's mind. In family lore, the sheriff played by his own rules. He would take in a troubled youth instead of putting him in jail. He once brought his sons to a grocery store robbery and had the 8-year-old dust for fingerprints.
In the two decades Gerdts has worked as a sheriff's deputy in Waseca County, things have changed in law enforcement. And tension from incidents like George Floyd's death, which happened an hour's drive north, have reverberated even in this rural expanse of farms, lakes and prairie.
One thing about the job, however, stays the same: Law enforcement officers here are people, neighbors, not some anonymous badge.
"Our county is 20,000 people, and I probably recognize 10,000 faces," Gerdts said on a recent evening as he drove down Hwy. 13. "I grab a cup of coffee at Kwik Trip and I'm stopped by four people who just want to talk."
The 10 months since Floyd's death have been chaotic for law enforcement in the Twin Cities. There have been protests and riots and an unprecedented number of officers leaving the Minneapolis force amid cratering morale. Even with an increase in crime, activists have called to reform police or defund police or abolish police altogether.
In rural areas of greater Minnesota, it's a different story. Instead of calls for police reform, there's been a groundswell of support. Instead of frequent protests, rural sheriffs tell of frequent boxes of thank-you doughnuts. Instead of being caricatured as villains, small-town police are hailed as heroes.
The differences around police-community relationships are easy to explain, Gerdts said: In the Twin Cities, anonymity breeds mistrust. In small towns, recognition breeds mutual respect.
"I work where I grew up," Gerdts said. "I don't want to have my mom hearing something in church about her son being a jerk."
* * *
The protests and rioting after Floyd's death were particularly resonant in Waseca County, which had just experienced its own traumatic moment involving police officers. In January 2020, Waseca police officer Arik Matson was shot in the head responding to a call. The assailant was sentenced to 35 years in prison, but Matson, a married father of two young girls, continues his long recovery.
Matson's shooting brought an outpouring of community support. All over the region, homeowners displayed blue lights. "Matson Strong" T-shirt sales benefited the family. A parade welcomed Matson back after nearly 10 months in the hospital and a rehabilitation center. A fundraiser scheduled for May 22 continues the community's embrace of the family.
After last year's protests and riots in the Twin Cities, public support for law enforcement in places like Waseca seemed only to rise.
"Our kids go to school with their kids, we live here, we go to the same churches," said Waseca County Sheriff Brad Milbrath. "I'd like to think if we had something that a deputy or officer did bad, people would come forward and talk with us about it. I couldn't go a day without someone coming up to me and saying, 'What the hell did this guy do that for?' "
When a friend died by suicide, it was Milbrath who knocked on the man's parents' door. When Milbrath encountered a man he'd once arrested for stealing a car, it wasn't a tense moment; the man laughed and challenged Milbrath to a footrace.
Perhaps this cordial relationship can be expected in places with small populations.
But there are other reasons.
A recent poll by Echelon Insights indicated the two most important concerns for Republican voters nationwide are illegal immigration and lack of support for law enforcement. Waseca County, part of a Republican stronghold in southern Minnesota, voted 64% for President Donald Trump in 2020.
The Waseca area also has a history of high-profile, gut-wrenching crimes: the 1999 murder of 12-year-old Cally Jo Larson, the 2007 murders of a 13-year-old son and his father, the foiled 2014 bombing plot at Waseca High School. Perhaps, local residents wonder, these crimes have underscored the importance of law enforcement here.
One other factor may be race. Like much of rural Minnesota, this county is homogeneous; Waseca County is 95% white. Historical, institutionalized, big-city issues between police and minorities simply don't register here.
"It's two different worlds, with just the sheer number of people in Minneapolis," said Joe Hoehn, a lifelong resident who owns The Mill, an event venue in Waseca. "I have friends living in the Cities and they don't know the people living on their own block. ... Systemic racism, it doesn't apply here. Because we know each other."
That's not to say Floyd's death didn't stir up emotions. Waseca saw several protests. But organizers directed protests at societal issues Floyd's death brought up, not at local police. The sheriff's biggest concern wasn't the protesters themselves but instead the occasional local who drove by and antagonized them.
* * *
Waseca's thriving downtown strip is filled with local businesses, with the down-home Pheasant Cafe across from the upscale Trio Wine Cafe. Police pass out treats on Halloween and host a summer event at the water park. When Police Chief Penny Vought crosses the street, her real estate agent stops her with an update on the house Vought is trying to buy.
"We wave to every cop, just like a head nod to a neighbor," said Bernie Gaytko, CEO and president of First National Bank of Waseca. "There's so many examples of cops and first responders being first on the scene, domestic issues, car accidents. People wanted to judge and rule and convict the day that George Floyd thing happened. My first reaction was let's just wait, hear all the facts of the case and not jump to any conclusions."
Ten miles down Hwy. 14 in Janesville, Jim Fury streamed the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on a recent afternoon at Fury's Barber Shop, which his father founded just after World War II. He's a chatty guy. Floyd's death and the aftermath have been a frequent topic of conversation. Some older clients have said Floyd was a criminal and had it coming. Fury pushes back.
"I'll say, 'Wait a minute -- he didn't deserve to die,' " Fury said.
But the vast majority of his clients "ache for the guy," Fury said of Floyd. People in rural Minnesota, however, don't understand the fallout after his death, Fury said: How did rioting help? Why did Chauvin's actions become an indictment of all police? And why so much focus on Floyd's death while several shootings of children in the Twin Cities have been blips on the radar?
"Everyone I've talked to realized George Floyd did not have to die," he said. "However, everyone does not understand why he was put in the status of a hero. ... I feel bad for cops, but I then feel bad for people who are victimized and not treated right. Derek Chauvin, I wish he'd just say, 'I'm sorry for what happened.' That would go a long ways."
For Gerdts, the deputy, the national debate about policing has been a difficult pill to swallow. The nightly news can feel like daily attacks on his profession. Law enforcement seems headed toward big institutional changes. It makes him anxious. It feels unfair.
"I've done nothing wrong," he said. "I go out and I do my best as a caretaker for the community."
He feels bad for Twin Cities police. He believes the lack of support from the Minneapolis City Council has torpedoed morale. But he's also looked inward, knowing his experience in rural Minnesota isn't universal.
"I know there are people who feel they are treated different by law enforcement," he said. "I can't say I understand, because I don't. I can't put myself in their shoes. But I know there are people who feel that way, and I respect that. And I do my best to reverse that -- to be the nice cop. If almost every contact you've had with law enforcement is negative, at least the one with me is positive."

Faye Price takes a bow: The Pillsbury House Theatre leader, instrumental in the passage of the Legacy Amendment, is stepping down after 21 years.

Full text: After the Twin Cities erupted in flames last June following the death of George Floyd, Pillsbury House Theatre, just two blocks from where Floyd's limp body was loaded into an ambulance, stepped into the breach. The company, housed in a community center in south Minneapolis, became a source of supplies for the reeling neighborhood. It joined other ad hoc responders in providing food for residents and portable toilets for visitors.
That response showed how Pillsbury House Theatre has become a community lifeblood, even as it produces compelling art. Now its self-effacing but effective leader, Faye Price, is stepping down at the end of June after 21 years at the helm.
"Faye has led with grace, smarts and talent -- exhibiting the power of theater as a tool for social healing and artistic expression," said Mixed Blood Theatre founder Jack Reuler, who has known Price since they first worked together in the 1970s.
While Price's title -- coproducing artistic director -- makes it sound like she was only in charge of theater, that is not entirely true. Her job, working closely with coproducing managing director NoÂ«l Raymond, entailed overseeing all the activities and programs housed in the building at 36th Street and S. Chicago Avenue, including a child care center, educational programs and, once, even a clinic.
Like Penumbra Theatre, which also is housed in a community center, Pillsbury House has married engagement with hard-hitting art long before it became fashionable.
"Faye is a theater professional through and through on all sides of the art," said Penumbra founder Lou Bellamy, one of Price's teachers. "She's skilled in dramaturgy and history as well as being talented and beautiful."
Hyde Park to Macalester
A native of the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Price first came to the Twin Cities to study at Macalester College, which awarded her its Catharine Lealtad Service to Society Award in 2006. She earned her graduate degree at the University of Minnesota, where she studied dramaturgy and criticism and was an August Wilson Fellow.
Price worked as a dramaturge at the Guthrie Theater on over a dozen shows, including "Crowns," "Summer and Smoke" and "Philadelphia, Here I Come," directed by Joe Dowling. She also has acted at the Guthrie, Penumbra, Mixed Blood and other theaters.
After she leaves office, co-leader Raymond will remain at Pillsbury House while Pillsbury Neighborhood Services, which oversees the center, tinkers with the leadership model.
"I'm excited to say I have no idea what I'll do next," Price said. "I'm going to take some time off and get back to really being an artist, doing whatever piques my interest. It's a giddy privilege to have this break."
Highlights of Price's career include productions of Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," Eisa Davis' "Bulrusher" and Tarell Alvin McCraney's Brother/Sister trilogy, done in collaboration with the Guthrie Theater and Mount Curve Productions and directed by Tony nominee Marion McClinton.
"When I decided that I wanted to produce the Brother/Sister Plays, and the Guthrie required a producing partner, Pillsbury House was the natural choice," said Frances Wilkinson, principal owner of Mount Curve. "Faye had a deep relationship with Marion. And I knew that they would be able to honor Tarell's lyrical voice and bring that kind of poetry to the stage."
Broad impact
As an actor, dramaturge, director and producer, Price often is known for her brilliance, lucidity and work ethic. And she has had an impact beyond Minneapolis. As the longtime board chair of Minnesota Citizens for the Arts (MCA), Price was key to state passage of the Legacy Amendment, which funds Minnesota's environment and arts.
"She recently won the Larry Award from MCA for being an unsung hero of the arts," said retired MCA executive director Sheila Smith. "Faye played a pivotal role with MCA as we conceived of and pushed forward the Legacy Amendment. She was someone I would call with a problem I couldn't figure out, and after a conversation with her, I always had better ideas than I did before."
Reuler, who has known Price since she was 17, described her as a "brilliant," "decisive leader" with impeccable taste. She also has been clear about how to manage personnel, and that involves hiring talented people and getting out of their way.
Price took over the shared leadership of Pillsbury House from theater founder Ralph Remington, who now is the arts leader for the city of San Francisco.
"The fact that Faye had NoÂ«l there basically was great because NoÂ«l had the institutional memory, so she knew the messaging and tone of the theater, and she and Faye built on that legacy," Remington said. "They developed new plays, had relationships with playwrights and pioneered other things."
One of the playwrights that Price encouraged was Christina Ham, now supervising producer for the Emmy-winning HBO series "Westworld."
"She's stable, grounded, visionary and practical," Ham said. "She was one of the first artists I met when I moved to the Twin Cities in '05 as she was working on my play, and we got along swimmingly."
Price later directed the world premiere of Ham's "Nina Simone: Four Women" in the Twin Cities before staging it at the Kennedy Center, and tapped Ham to become a Mellon-funded playwright-in-residence at Pillsbury House.
"We were able to bring some theater and other work to the stage that Twin Cities audiences were not seeing and were not able to get elsewhere," Price said. "We also showed how an arts institution embedded in community can hold those relationships in non-transactional ways. I really think that where we sit in the landscape, physically and psychically, is really healthy and a model for perhaps what other institutions want to be, especially in the wake of George Floyd."
Raymond became teary-eyed as she spoke about her departing colleague.
"There's a big piece of grief and loss that will go with her," Raymond said. "I'm super happy for Faye because it's a lot of work to drag an institution around for 21 years, on top of being an artist. Her imprint is all over this place. I miss her already and very much want to be in support of whatever comes next."

Chauvin didn't say he put knee on neck: Retired supervisor says lack of resistance made restraint unwarranted.

Full text: Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin did not initially tell his supervisor that he knelt on George Floyd's neck, and when he did, the ex-officer failed to report that the restraint lasted more than nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for his life, according to testimony in Hennepin County District Court on Thursday.
Recently retired supervisory Sgt. David Pleoger spoke to Chauvin on a cellphone May 25 after receiving a call from a 911 dispatcher about a possible use of force by officers seen on city surveillance cameras.
A body-worn camera captured Pleoger's initial cellphone conversation with Chauvin, who downplayed what had happened, saying, "Not really, but had to hold the guy down, he was going crazy â€¦ wouldn't go in the back of the squad."
Under questioning from prosecutor Steve Schleicher, Pleoger said Chauvin didn't say anything about putting his knee on Floyd's neck. Schleicher then pressed Pleoger on whether Chauvin's force was appropriate.
"When Mr. Floyd was no longer offering up any resistance to the officers, they could have ended their restraint," Pleoger said.
Schleicher asked if that was when Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground, Pleoger replied, "Yes."
Asked whether Chauvin initially mentioned any use of force, Pleoger said, "I don't believe so."
Pleoger was the fifth and final witness on the fourth day of testimony in Chauvin's trial on charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. He followed testimony from Floyd's former girlfriend, Courteney Ross, who tenderly recalled their initial meeting and mutual struggle with opioid addiction over a three-year stretch.
Also taking the stand were the two paramedics and a fire captain who tried to resuscitate Floyd. Derek Smith, a paramedic, checked Floyd's carotid pulse and pupils as he lay motionless under Chauvin's knee.
"I looked to my partner. I told him, 'I think he's dead and I want to move this out of here and begin care in the back [of the ambulance],' " said Smith, noting the agitated crowd of bystanders. "In a living person there should be a pulse there. I did not feel one. I suspected this patient to be dead."
Smith testified that despite never sensing a pulse, they continued trying to save Floyd. "He's a human being," Smith said. "I was trying to give him a second chance at life."
Pleoger's testimony offered the first account of Chauvin's words and behavior in the immediate aftermath of Floyd's death.
He testified that Chauvin told him that Floyd "became combative â€¦ after struggling with him. He suffered a medical emergency and an ambulance was called."
As Pleoger arrived at the scene outside Cup Foods where Floyd was restrained on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill, body camera footage captured him instructing Chauvin and officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng to speak with witnesses.
Chauvin responded, "We can try, they're all pretty hostile."
Pleoger then headed to HCMC in downtown Minneapolis to check on Floyd and instructed Chauvin and Thao to do the same. At HCMC, Pleoger said he asked Chauvin directly about the force he used.
"He said he knelt on Floyd or knelt on his neck," Pleoger testified.
Schleicher asked, "Is that the first time you became aware that force had been applied to George Floyd's neck?"
Pleoger responded, "Yes."
Schleicher asked if Chauvin told him how long he had applied the pressure. Pleoger said no.
Pleoger said he soon learned Floyd had died, so he notified internal affairs, ordered Chauvin and Thao separated and directed them to City Hall police headquarters to be interviewed. He did the same for Kueng and Lane, who were still in south Minneapolis.
In his cross-examination, defense attorney Eric Nelson continued to build on his ongoing theme about the difficulties of police decisions when faced with confrontational bystanders and safety hazards posed by passing cars and buses.
He asked Pleoger, "Would you agree with the general premise that the use of force is not necessarily attractive [and] sometimes officers have to do very violent things? It's a dangerous job."
"Yes," Pleoger replied.
Nelson asked whether it was more important for officers to deal with an encroaching crowd threat or a medical emergency. Pleoger said he would try to deal with both simultaneously.
Nelson got Pleoger to agree that giving medical aid on the spot might not be wise if there was an especially agitated crowd nearby or if a suspect were in a busy street "with buses and cars going by."
In general, the defense attorney said, officers need to assess "the totality of the circumstances and not just one single factor." The sergeant agreed with Nelson.
In the first three days of the trial, prosecutors played numerous videos from bystanders and the officers' own body cameras that showed the force used on Floyd continued for minutes after he fell silent. Thursday's testimony included much shorter video and images that showed the arrival of Hennepin EMS paramedics on the scene and in the ambulance.
Paramedic Smith and his partner Seth Bravinder testified about their efforts to revive Floyd en route to HCMC. Smith said he wanted to move Floyd quickly off the street.
Minneapolis Fire Capt. Jeremy Norton testified about meeting up with the ambulance at E. 36th Street and S. Park Avenue, where he saw Floyd being treated by the paramedics and Lane.
"He was an unresponsive body on a cot," Norton said of Floyd.
Norton said that upon his initial arrival at Cup Foods, he encountered an "agitated to distraught" off-duty firefighter, Genevieve Hansen, and other bystanders. Hansen testified Tuesday that she tried to intervene but was rebuffed by the officers. After Floyd was brought to the hospital, Norton told his supervisors at the fire department what happened.
"I was worried that a man had been killed in police custody â€¦ and then I also wanted to notify my supervisor that there was an off-duty firefighter that was a witness at the scene," Norton said.
The day's testimony started with 45-year-old Ross recalling her relationship with the strong, physically active man she called "Floyd."
Ross began sobbing as she described how she met Floyd in August 2017 while he was working security at the Salvation Army Harbor Light shelter in downtown Minneapolis. Ross said she was at the shelter to meet her son's father.
"I started fussin' in the corner of the lobby" because the father wasn't coming, she said. That's when the two met, she said, dabbing tears.
"You OK, sis?" she recalled him saying in his "great, deep Southern voice, raspy." They met again soon and had their first kiss in that lobby, she said.
She talked about their mutual oxycodone addiction that started with prescriptions for chronic pain and led to purchasing street drugs. She said they were off and on the drugs and by May she believed Floyd was using them again.
Ross also revealed that Floyd was hospitalized in March 2020 for several days because of a heroin overdose.
The defense is trying to raise the possibility that Floyd died of a drug overdose from pills obtained by Morries Hall, who was with Floyd at Cup Foods the day he died.
Ross said she and Floyd got pills in May that reminded her of "the same feeling" she had from similar pills she took in March, a stimulant that kept her up all night and left her jittery.
"And by similar experience, do you recall telling the FBI that when you had them that you felt like you were going to die?" Nelson asked. Ross said she didn't recall saying that.
Hall has filed paperwork with the court stating that he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify.
Lane, Kueng and Thao are expected to go on trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin.

"Both Floyd and I, our story is a classic story of how we both get addicted to opioids. ... We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times."

"I was worried that a man had been killed in police custody â€¦ and then I also wanted to notify my supervisor that there was an off-duty firefighter that was a witness at the scene."

Full text: Bridgett Floyd loaded boxes with green, red and yellow produce as sunlight beamed through the windows at the Salvation Army.
She cracked jokes. She chatted with volunteers. She evoked the memory of her older brother George Floyd on Thursday, several miles south of the courtroom where the man charged in his killing stood trial as the world watched.
"This has already taken my mind off of what is going on [in the courtroom,] and I needed that a little bit," Bridgett Floyd said. "I needed that a little bit. It's been a trying, trying week. And we will get through it. We will get through it."
After traveling from her home in Fayetteville, N.C., to seek justice for her brother, Floyd took the morning off from watching the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin. Instead, she spent it giving away food at the Salvation Army food shelf on E. Lake Street. It was the type of service George Floyd knew well: He worked as a security guard for a downtown homeless shelter run by the Salvation Army and often stopped by to visit friends and volunteer for the needy even after his job ended.
"They're going to discredit George Floyd" during the trial, said Jacari Harris, who accompanied Bridgett Floyd to the Salvation Army. "But we want the world to remember and know that George Floyd was active in the community. He volunteered. He showed up. He would give the shirt off his back."
Bridgett Floyd launched the George Floyd Memorial Foundation last September to carry on her brother's legacy and promote social justice. The organization made its first $5,000 donation to the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Center last year and hired Harris as executive director. Bridgett Floyd, who is president, and Harris hope to participate in several more community events during the trial, trying to carry out the deeds they believe George Floyd would still be doing if he were alive.
"It's been an emotional roller coaster," Bridgett Floyd said. "I'm here to stand tall for my brother. To let everyone know that he was not the guy that officers made him to be. ... He had a family. He had a little girl that he left behind. And he left people behind that really cared about him. The community was his heart."
She recalled seeing Floyd when he visited her family in Fayetteville -- where he was born in 1973 -- about six months before he died. "He enjoyed every minute of it," she said.
Bridgett Floyd described the trial as overwhelming. What really got to her, she said, was when bystander Charles McMillian broke down crying on the witness stand while testifying about how he tried to help Floyd at the scene and admonished Chauvin for kneeling on him. She thought his reaction showed how "there's still love out here. People know the truth and we will get justice."
She added: "He felt how we feel. He broke down how we had been breaking down every single day this has been going on since my brother left on May 25 of last year. It's been a trying time, and I felt his pain."
Harris, who is also visiting from North Carolina, has been accompanying family members to the trial. He said they pray each day beforehand: for justice, peace, unity, love. But watching graphic videos of Floyd's death in recent days has hurt.
"Some of us had to just walk out of the room, the overflow room," Harris said. "It was just that painful to watch over and over and over. We didn't want to be reminded of that so that's why we're here today, to be reminded of the work that George Floyd did."
Hauling some produce back into the kitchen, Salvation Army volunteer John Morrisette said he also finds it difficult to keep watching videos of Floyd's final hour.
"That was hard," he said. "That was hard. But you have to expose yourself to some of that once in a while in life."
As a line of residents in need formed outside, Bridgett Floyd wheeled a cart slowly around a U-shaped display of produce, filling cardboard boxes with pineapples, bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, limes, lemons, mangoes, cabbage, carrots and green chiles.
Harris helped her bring them to a table before they went around again.
Bridgett Floyd soon moved to the door, where others were handing out free boxes of produce. Demand has been up since the pandemic began and riots struck the neighborhood after Floyd's death. A middle-aged woman with a young girl walked up.
"We'll take it to your car," Floyd offered, lugging the box with Harris as they walked around the corner through a cold wind.
"Have an awesome day!" she told the woman. Floyd leaned down to say goodbye to the little girl: "See you later, baby!"
She walked back and struck up a conversation with Salvation Army Major Robert Viquez, saying, "Today was a very good day."
"Thank you for doing this," Viquez said.
She told him she'd love to do more for the Salvation Army in Minnesota: "I will definitely come back."

Slaying reignites debate at 38th St.: Victim helped patrol the still-closed intersection, where crime has surged.

Full text: Imez Wright, the man killed last month while working security around the now infamous south Minneapolis corner store where he roamed the aisles as a child, was gunned down while serving as a positive fixture at George Floyd Square, his family said, mentoring Black youth and training to be a mental health practitioner.
Wright's suspected killer, Shantaello Christianson, has since been arrested and charged with murder. But that fact has done little to ease the grief of his friends and relatives, who said that at 30 Wright had just begun to experience life. He was working with at-risk youths to help steer them from gangs and drugs, they said, and was a father to an infant son and a daughter.
His death reignited a citywide debate about reopening the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue -- the site of George Floyd's fatal encounter with police last year, which set off nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality, and underscores rising crime surrounding a space many now consider sacred.
Ernest McCurty questioned why someone would want to kill his nephew, who everyone knew as "Mez."
"My nephew will be missed by many," McCurty wrote in a Twitter message. "I want to get something nice for him placed on 38th, with no disrespect to George Floyd family at all -- we are grieving for George as well as Mez."
On March 6, Wright was outside Cup Foods, 3759 S. Chicago Av., about 5:45 p.m. when surveillance video showed a
man jumping out of a cream-colored Chevy Suburban and starting to argue with Wright. Police said that Christianson, whose wife is related to the other man, then opened fire. Wright was hit several times in the chest and the hand. He died later at HCMC. Christianson and his wife were arrested four days later in Brooklyn Center.
Wright grew up in the area and had been going to Cup Foods since he was kid. At some point, he joined the Rolling 30s Bloods gang, which despite its reputation for violence has long been a part of the fabric of the neighborhood.
Prosecutors say that recent years had brought infighting among factions within the gang, which they suggested was the cause of the argument that preceded Wright's death.
Court records show that Wright had several brushes with the law, including a conviction for domestic abuse and another for the sale of narcotics in 2012.
But friends and relatives say that he seemed to be turning a corner and was putting his gifts to use by helping others like him who were trying to escape their circumstances.
A former supervisor of Wright's told the Star Tribune that Wright was passionate about changing his life. Quinton Bonds got to know Wright at Change Inc., a local outreach organization, where Wright was part of a team of staffers who mentored Black youth in St. Paul. He was also training to be a mental health practitioner.
"It is a huge loss for our organization, our team," Bonds said in a previous interview with the newspaper. "Our team is like family. We lost a family member."
At the time of his death, Wright was working for the Agape movement, a community protection program for George Floyd Square. Agape's staff includes ex-gang members from the neighborhood. The group is on contract with the city to keep watch over the area, including businesses like Cup Foods.
On social media, news of his death was met with an outpouring of condolences and tributes, with one commenter on Facebook recalling how Wright was always "lighting up the room with the smile." Another wrote that Wright's "vibe is unmatched" and that he had helped her through "one of the hardest times" of her life.
A post on Instagram showed several people gathering at a makeshift memorial outside Cup Foods, where they had spelled out the words, "IMEZ PLAY" with candles at the spot where he was shot.
McCurty, the uncle, wrote that Wright was a "great mentor" to young people, in whom he instilled the importance of going to school and being respectful to their elders.
He said many people looked up to Wright.
"Imez was known in his neighborhood," McCurty wrote. He said it means a lot to Wright's family and friends that the "whole community had love for Imez."
The shooting renewed concerns about the future of the intersection, which has been closed off to traffic by city-erected concrete barricades. City officials for months have signaled their desire to reopen the area, but recently said they would not do so until after the conclusion of the murder trial of since-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who is facing murder charges in Floyd's death. Now that timetable could be moved up.
Several weeks after Wright's death, officials announced that they had enlisted help from federal law enforcement to help fight crime and monitor 38th and Chicago, citing the recent surge in gun violence at the once-peaceful memorial. The move has been met with deep mistrust from some in the area, which became a spot for mourning and reflection after Floyd died.
Some accuse officials of using the violence that has long been a problem in the area as justification for increased enforcement.
Federal law enforcement agencies including the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives pledged their support and resources at a news conference announcing the initiative.

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: MAN WITH FLOYD PLEADS 5TH

Full text: A man who was with George Floyd the day he died in Minneapolis police custody filed a notice with the court Wednesday saying he will invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination if he is asked to testify in court.
The Hennepin County Public Defender's Office filed the notice on behalf of Morries Hall, who was sitting in the front passenger seat of a vehicle with Floyd, who was in the driver's seat, when police approached Floyd for allegedly using a fake $20 bill at Cup Foods in south Minneapolis.
"Counsel for Mr. Hall respectfully moves this court to quash the subpoena â€¦ and release Mr. Hall from any obligations therein," said the notice filed by Assistant Public Defender Adrienne Cousins.
The notice did not provide additional details.
Prosecutors and defense attorney Eric Nelson listed Hall as a potential witness in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.
Police body camera videos show Hall sitting in the car with Floyd as another occupant, Shawanda Hill, sat in the back seat.
Nelson told jurors in his opening statements Monday that investigators found pill fragments made to look like Percocet in the car. They allegedly tested positive for a mixture of methamphetamine and fentanyl, which was found in Floyd's system.
Nelson also said Hall and Hill would testify that Floyd consumed two pills in the car before police arrived, fell asleep and could not be awakened by Hall or Hill.
"The evidence will show that when confronted by police, Mr. Floyd put drugs in his mouth in an effort to conceal them from police," Nelson said.

New Floyd footage spurs anguish: Video shows Cup Foods purchase that set events in motion. Witness recalls his Chauvin confrontation.

Full text: The man who witnessed the entirety of George Floyd's fatal arrest by Minneapolis police sobbed in court Wednesday and struggled to speak after seeing video of himself urging Floyd to get off the ground and go along with the officers.
With 61-year-old Charles McMillian on the witness stand, prosecutor Erin Eldridge played surveillance and police body camera video of officers handcuffing Floyd and pushing him into the squad on May 25, 2020. When she paused the video, McMillian dropped his head, gasped and said, "Oh, my God."
He fought to continue, saying he felt "helpless" seeing it again.
McMillian's anguished recollection came amid a day of illuminating testimony and video footage revealed publicly for the first time in which Floyd was seen inside Cup Foods buying cigarettes and Chauvin was heard defending his actions after the ambulance carrying Floyd left the scene. Prosecutors played back-to-back video from the body cameras of all four officers at the scene with Floyd's moans of pain, calls for help and cries of "I can't breathe" reverberating through the afternoon courtroom session.
Chauvin is on trial for second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. Former Minneapolis police officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are scheduled for trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin.
After a short break to steady himself, McMillian returned to the stand and recounted how he had confronted Chauvin immediately after Floyd's limp body was loaded into an ambulance. He said he told Chauvin he once got along fine with police, but now looked at him as a "maggot."
McMillian is seen and heard in many of the videos from the scene. Explaining how he came to be there, McMillian said he was driving by Cup Foods when he saw the beginnings of Floyd's police encounter and pulled over because he was being "nosy."
He is heard repeatedly urging Floyd to comply. "I'm watching Mr. Floyd, I'm trying to get him to understand that when you make a mistake, once they get you in handcuffs there's no such thing as being claustrophobic, you have to go. â€¦ I've had interactions with officers myself and I realize once you get in the cuffs you can't win," McMillian explained on the stand.
Floyd heard him, too, and responded directly.
When Floyd was under Chauvin's knee, McMillian said, "Get up and get in the car."
Floyd responded, "I will. I can't move."
McMillian said he recognized Chauvin at the scene, having encountered him five days earlier and spoken to him.
So outside Cup Foods, after McMillian saw the officers load Floyd's motionless, silent body into the ambulance, McMillian approached Chauvin again in an exchange captured on police body camera, although McMillian is difficult to hear.
"I think I said to him, 'Five days ago I told you at the end of the day go home to your family safe, and that the next person go home to their family safe, but today I gotta look at you as a maggot,' " McMillian said under questioning by Eldridge.
Chauvin, who has not spoken publicly in his own defense, did so briefly to McMillian that day in the exchange captured on video, saying, "We've gotta control this guy because he's a sizable guy, looks like he's probably on something."
Eldridge asked McMillian, "Why did you feel the need to talk to Mr. Chauvin?" McMillian replied: "Because what I watched was wrong."
Defense attorney Eric Nelson didn't question McMillian.
Some of the testimony in the trial will be more technical, but the first three days have been filled with scene video and traumatized eyewitnesses. Floyd's pained "I can't breathe" and calls for his "mama" have echoed through the days.
Floyd's youngest brother occupied the lone family seat in the courtroom for the afternoon session and did not watch the video when the officers were trying to get Floyd into the squad car. Rodney Floyd stared down, his eyes wide during that video moment.
When video was shown of George Floyd yelling "Mama" repeatedly and "I can't breathe," again Rodney Floyd averted his eyes while looking down and shaking his head. He had much the same reaction when video of the arrest was played later from each of the officers' body-worn cameras.
At midmorning, Judge Peter Cahill called an unexpected break when a female juror stood, waved, gestured toward the door and quickly left. Upon return, she sat in the witness stand for on-the-record questioning by the judge.
The white woman in her 50s, a health care administrator, told Cahill she was feeling "shaky but better." She said she's had trouble sleeping. "I've been awake since 2 a.m.," she said.
But she said, "I think I'll be OK going forward. â€¦ I feel like there's a tension that's gone a little bit."
Her need for a break came as jurors heard from 19-year-old Christopher Martin, who worked at Cup Foods and informed his manager of the suspected counterfeit bill Floyd used to buy cigarettes. Martin described Floyd as friendly, but that he appeared to be high on drugs.
During his testimony, prosecutors played video footage publicly for the first time from inside the store. Floyd was seen in his black tank top and navy blue pants, ambling around, picking up a banana, dropping it, and appearing to dance and wander. Also seen were Morries Hall and Shawanda Hill, who were with him in the SUV when he was first detained by police.
Martin said he considered not informing his manager of the fake bill, but store policy is that he would have to cover the loss. Under his manager's directive, Martin went outside twice to try to get Floyd to return but Floyd wouldn't. A co-worker called 911.
Minutes later, Martin went outside when he became aware of commotion on the street and saw Floyd pinned under Chauvin's knee. On video footage, Martin could be seen among the anxious bystanders calling on the police to save Floyd's life. Later, he was pacing with his head in his hands.
He had worked at Cup Foods for four months, but quit soon after Floyd's death. "I didn't feel safe," he said.
Nelson's time questioning Martin dealt a fair amount with Floyd appearing to be under the influence of drugs. Martin confirmed that he told investigators earlier that Floyd's speech was delayed as he "was trying to form the words."
Also testifying Wednesday was Christopher Belfrey, 45, who was parked to pick up food with his fiance when he saw Lane approach Floyd in the SUV with his gun drawn.
Belfrey began to record with his phone, but then moved his car across the street because "I didn't want to be trapped between the whole commotion going on."
He resumed recording as the officers sat Floyd on the pavement, but he soon stopped and left, saying he thought it was over when Floyd got in the squad car.

"It startled me when I seen the o cer raise his gun. I started recording."
Christopher Belfrey, 45, was picking up food with his fiance and parked behind the SUV with Floyd and his friends inside. He began filming when he saw officer Thomas Lane point a gun at Floyd and pull him out of the vehicle. He then moved his car across the street to avoid "commotion" and resumed filming as the officers sat Floyd on the pavement and questioned him.

FLOYD SQUARE SHOPS MAY GET CITY RELIEF: $50,000 FORGIVABLE LOANS COULD GO TO BUSINESSES ON CLOSED-OFF STREETS

Full text: Minneapolis businesses struggling to survive inside the area known as George Floyd Square could soon get monetary help from the city.
The Business, Inspections, Housing and Zoning Committee has unanimously approved $50,000 interest-free, forgivable loans for small businesses and nonprofits behind the barricades surrounding the makeshift memorial where George Floyd struggled under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.
Borrowers would not have to repay the loans if their business or organization stays open for one year.
The loan program would repurpose half of the city's budgeted small-business loan pool, or about $1 million.
The proposal is headed to next week's City Council meeting for a final vote.
"The businesses and organizations located in the immediate area of 38th and Chicago have experienced an exceptional economic burden, as the location of Mr. George Floyd's death and the subsequent closing of the intersection to regular vehicle traffic," said Erik Hansen, the city's director of economic policy and development. "Existing city programs are inadequate to address the losses."
The barricaded area, stretching from 37th to 39th streets and Elliot and Columbus avenues, is under occupation by protesters who have given the city 24 demands for relinquishing the street.
Black business owners inside the zone have organized to complain that they don't agree with the barricades, which they claim encumber delivery drivers and provide a cover for crime.
When 30-year-old Imez Wright was killed at 38th and Chicago on March 6, businesses and residents reported hearing gunshots for days afterward. Protesters occupying the square ordered it closed for mourning throughout the start of jury selection in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin.
Just Turkey owner Sam Willis Jr. and other business owners in the square have been meeting with city officials to come up with some form of economic assistance to offset the impact of street closures.
"We talked about it [Tuesday], and I thought it was a great idea," Willis said of the forgivable loans.
Police respond to 911 calls from the square and recently pursued shooting suspects into the intersection. Yet protesters do not welcome police and complain they desecrate Floyd's memorial with their presence.
The Powderhorn Park and Corcoran neighborhood organizations released a joint statement last month saying they "do not believe that the rise in violent crimes in our community is a result of the 38th and Chicago intersection being closed." They thanked protesters for taking care of the Floyd memorial, which has drawn visitors from around the world.
City Council Member Alondra Cano said the forgivable loans for 38th and Chicago were prompted by the gun violence that occurred this month.
"There's no interest, there's no down payment, there's no red tape," she said. "I think everybody acknowledges â€¦ it's not going to be sustainable to ask people to pay money back."
The city's Community Planning and Economic Development Department would service the loan program. Staff are developing an application process. If approved, money would be available for borrowers in about six weeks.
