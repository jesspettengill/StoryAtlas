Full text: When Miguel Sano cracked a second-inning double down the left-field line in the home opener against the Cardinals on Tuesday, it might have provided a bit of relief for the Twins about the status of their only player known to have come down with COVID-19.
Sano missed nearly two weeks of training camp, and though he reported no symptoms of coronavirus while he was out, and had looked healthy once he returned, he also had only a week to regain his timing at the plate, all while adjusting to a new position in the field. So it was difficult to tell whether his 0-for-8 start in Chicago -- he's now 1-for-14 (.071) with six strikeouts after Wednesday -- was anything more than two quiet days.
"It's getting there. He's hit some balls very hard," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said of his new first baseman. "He's going to need some at-bats before, I'm sure, he looks at all of us and says, 'Now I'm all the way back. Now I'm 100 percent, timing-wise, and feeling good at the plate.' But that being said, he had good at-bats."
One thing Baldelli said he's definitely not worried about is Sano's physical condition. "He's in good shape. One amazing thing about Miguel, even though the COVID issues and everything, his body does hold up as well as anyone we have," the manager said. "He's a big guy [who] has dealt with some injuries. But as far as the way he holds up day to day to the baseball schedule, watching him out there when it's 95 degrees outside, he holds up as well as anyone."
Awesome Aussies
Lewis Thorpe has recovered from the bruised left knee he suffered Sunday in Chicago, and said he is ready to pitch again. Thorpe was hit by a Jose Abreu ground ball that "got me in the right spot, and it just locked up," Thorpe said, and was bruised afterward. "It hit me in a weird spot, to where I really couldn't push off on it, so that was concerning." He left the game but said the limp was gone by Tuesday, and he was available again to pitch.
Thorpe said he is enjoying having fellow Australian Aaron Whitefield as a teammate. "It's awesome. We have a bit of banter going back and forth, and I'm making him feel comfortable here," Thorpe said of the rookie outfielder. "All of Australia back home is really proud of us," he said, as evidenced by the deluge of text messages he and Whitefield receive daily.
Support for Floyd
Baldelli said the Twins' midgame interruption Tuesday at the symbolic hour of 8:46 p.m. to memorialize George Floyd "was a great moment," one he believes fulfills the Twins' obligation to lead.
"Being in Minneapolis … I do feel like we should be ambassadors in some way for baseball," Baldelli said. "This is something we wanted to make sure we did right. We made it a point to make a meaningful acknowledgment and to share our feelings and our thoughts, and we've encouraged every one of our guys to express themselves."
A sign on the right field wall reads "Justice for George Floyd," one of the many ways the Twins have noted his death.
"We discussed many initiatives, many different ways to show our support for George Floyd's family, for the community. For the most part, we said, 'We should do them all,' and take this opportunity to make this a very meaningful one for our group and for the Twins," Baldelli said. "There's only so many times where you have a platform to bring something to somebody's attention, to bring it to the fans, to bring it to the community. This is one of those times."
Fans to get face time
The Twins originally didn't plan to sell "seats" to fans behind home plate, choosing instead to fill the spaces with large cardboard-cutout heads of several dozen of their greatest players. But they've changed that policy, now that TV viewers have seen the big faces during broadcasts.
Beginning with the next homestand on Aug. 14, the 30-inch faces will be interspersed with those of fans, who can pay $80 (or $40 for season-ticket holders) to be included, and afterward keep the giant likeness as a souvenir. More information is available at twinsbaseball.com/fanface.
Etc.
• Jake Odorizzi, on the injured list because of a sore back, was scheduled to throw a bullpen Wednesday or Thursday, but Baldelli and pitching coach Wes Johnson have not yet decided whether the righthander will make his 2020 debut during this homestand.

Thao seeks dismissal of felony criminal charges: The former Mpls. officer is among 4 charged in the death of George Floyd.

Full text: Another of the three former Minneapolis police officers who were charged last month for failing to stop former officer Derek Chauvin from fatally restraining George Floyd by kneeling on his neck has filed a motion to dismiss two felony charges against him.
Attorneys for Tou Thao, who was seen on a bystander's cellphone video keeping people at bay while Floyd was being held down, asked Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill to toss the two aiding-and-abetting charges "on the grounds that they are not supported by probable cause."
The lawyers, Robert Paule and Natalie Paule of Minneapolis, argue in their three-page motion that county prosecutors had failed to show that Thao knew that Chauvin and the other officers were going to commit a crime. They also argue that prosecutors failed to show that Thao's presence or actions at the scene were done "to further commission of that crime."
The Paules wrote that they will submit evidence, including video from Thao's body camera, police training materials, and video from the bodycam of former officer Thomas Lane, 37, who also has been charged. Like Thao, Lane is seeking dismissal of the aiding-and-abetting charges. Thao lacked the required mental state required to support the charges against him, his lawyers wrote.
Floyd was killed in police custody May 25, provoking protests in Minneapolis and in many other cities across the U.S. and the world.
Thao, 37, was charged with one count of aiding and abetting unintentional second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years, and one count of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years.
Former officers Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, 26 face two similar charges. Chauvin, 44, faces second- and third-degree murder charges and second-degree manslaughter. Thao's attorneys are asking for a hearing on their dismissal motion on Sept. 11. Cahill gave prosecutors until Aug. 17 to respond.

ACLU sues over wounding of protesters in Minneapolis: The lawsuit says officers often fired without warning, inflicted severe bruising and damage from tear gas.

Full text: Leading law enforcement figures in Minnesota were sued Tuesday on allegations that officers violated protesters' civil rights when they wounded them during the late-spring unrest in Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd while in police custody.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis names as defendants Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, state Department of Public Safety (DPS) Commissioner John Harrington, State Patrol Col. Matthew Langer and Minneapolis Police Federation President Bob Kroll.
The suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a Twin Cities law firm lists four Minneapolis plaintiffs -- Nekima Levy Armstrong and husband Marques Armstrong, Terry Hempfling and Rachel Clark -- but is requesting class-action status, which could lead to many more joining.
Messages were left for all the defendants late Tuesday morning seeking their response to the suit. None has addressed the specific allegations, but the DPS said in a statement that it "defends and supports citizens' constitutional right to First Amendment expression when exercised in a lawful and nonviolent manner."
This is at least the third federal lawsuit against law enforcement in connection with the protests. In early June, the ACLU sued seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent officer misconduct directed at the news media. The suit said officers threatened, assaulted and, in several cases, arrested members of the media, even after they identified themselves as journalists.
In mid-June, freelance journalist Linda Tirado alleged in her suit that officers blinded her in one eye with a nonlethal projectile fired at her despite her declaring in words and documentation that she was a member of the news media.
According to Tuesday's suit, Minneapolis police and the patrol used unnecessary and excessive force to suppress the free speech rights of protesters with tear gas, pepper spray, foam bullets and other devices.
The officers often fired without warning and inflicted injuries to the four named plaintiffs that remain two months later, the suit says, listing severe bruising and vocal difficulties from the tear gas as among the afflictions.
"No one should face tear gassing, foam bullets or pepper spray while exercising their right to peacefully protest," Teresa Nelson, legal director for the ACLU in Minnesota, said in a statement released in concert with the suit's filing. "That law enforcement here followed their typical pattern of using indiscriminate force rather than respecting the First Amendment, especially following the brutal murder of George Floyd by four of their own, is disgraceful and an affront to our Constitution."
Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and activist, added in her own statement: "As one of the protesters who was teargassed, I still feel the lingering effects of such a strong chemical agent. We are participating in the lawsuit to protect our First Amendment freedoms of speech and the right to peaceably assemble in protest."
The suit details what the Armstrongs say they endured while at the Third Precinct police station at E. Lake Street and S. Minnehaha Avenue on May 27 during their second day of protesting:
Early that evening, officers on the precinct roof sprayed tear gas into the crowd without warning that reached the Armstrongs while they were peacefully demonstrating.
Nekima Levy Armstrong felt tingling and burning in her throat and chest, while both struggled to breathe. Since that encounter, her voice has yet to return to normal, and she has had "lingering lung issues."
Hempfling was in the same area on the same day, the suit says, and was struck on the back of her right arm by "a rubber bullet and/or less-lethal munition fired by the MPD," according to the suit.
On May 29, a few hours after a statewide curfew went into effect, Hempfling and Clark were confronted by officers near the Fifth Precinct station at E. 31st Street and S. Nicollet Avenue. Within a minute or two of a dispersal order being issued, the Minneapolis police fired tear gas and nonlethal munitions at the women.
Hempfling was hit four times: twice on her back and once each on her breast and thigh. The bruising has remained for two months. Clark was hit on one arm, a hip and an ankle. Her bruises also have yet to heal.
The lawsuit seeks a declaration that this police conduct violated the First, Fourth and 14th amendments to the Constitution, an injunction against similar actions by law enforcement in the future and unspecified compensation for damages and attorneys' fees.

A HOME OPENER LIKE NO OTHER: NO FANS, PLENTY OF WORRY AS BASEBALL BACK AT TARGET FIELD

Full text: If players draw energy from their cheering fans, if home-field advantage is derived, as some statistical studies suggest, from the pressure a loud, noisy crowd imposes on umpires, then COVID-19 and the elimination of ticket-holders has rendered Target Field impotent. Welcome to neutral-site baseball, right?
Quite the opposite, Rocco Baldelli figures.
"There's actually more ability to relax and breathe" at home now, the Twins manager said after experiencing five days in Chicago to open the brief 2020 season. "You're not on the go, you're not in different environments, you're not moving around constantly on buses and things like that. It eliminates a little stress for guys."
Considering his players were so stressed, they managed to score only an American League-high 27 runs on White Sox turf, it's easy to wonder whether they will even notice the surroundings Tuesday, the 60th home opener in Minnesota Twins history.
But this will be a home opener unlike any other, and not just because the paid attendance against the Cardinals is guaranteed to be 0.
For one thing, the Twins surely understand now how tenuous this season is, given Monday's news that more than a dozen Miami Marlins players and staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus during a weekend road trip to Philadelphia. No Twins regular has been infected since the active roster arrived for camp at the beginning of July, but there's no guarantee, and perhaps little chance, that their tests will remain 100% negative throughout the season.
Then again, there were plenty of moments over the past four months in which it appeared unlikely games would ever take place in Target Field in 2020.
"You talk to some people and they're hopeful and they make you feel good, and then you turn on the news and it's like, 'Oh man, I just hope we put on a uniform again at some point,' " bench coach Mike Bell said.
"Obviously, a lot of it wasn't even about the game. It was about what families were going through with COVID. A lot of people struggling emotionally, mentally with different things."
Not only are the Twins mindful of the pandemic that has reduced the 2020 season to a nine-week hiccup -- a group "first pitch" will be performed virtually by nine medical professionals who have treated COVID-19 victims for months -- but they are also sensitive to the worldwide movement that was triggered by the horrific killing of George Floyd just 50 blocks away.
"Responsibility. That's the word I've been thinking about," Twins President of Baseball Operations Derek Falvey said of his franchise's obligation to memorialize Floyd. "You'll see some focus on that. You'll see some things that are reflective of that. For all of us who live here in the Twin Cities, we want to focus on what we've experienced in our local communities. Our players feel it, our staff does."
Fans will see it, too, in a graphic that will be displayed on the outfield wall throughout the season, and also when the game is halted at 8:46 p.m. -- Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes, 46 seconds -- for a moment of silence in his memory.
There will be plenty of other Opening Day traditions observed, too, even an Air Force flyover above an empty ballpark.
"I think the environment is going to be a lot of fun and maybe a little different from some of the games we have played so far on the road," Baldelli said. "Just a little more going on, and some real life in the ballpark."
Ultimately, the game will become the focus. Homer Bailey will make his Twins and Target Field debut, Josh Donaldson will make it his new home, and though there won't be any cheering to welcome them, beyond the generic prerecorded kind piped in over the public address system, the game -- played at a ballpark where the Twins have won 56% of the time over the past three seasons -- will settle into something approximating normal.
"That's what I noticed in Chicago -- it's really strange, how quiet it is, but you get used to it and after a couple of innings, you're like, 'OK, this is just what it's going to be. This is all we can do, really,' " Falvey said.
"It will be nice to be in our home park, in familiar surroundings. I expect that will help. Not exactly normal, but nothing feels normal this year."
TWINS HOME OPENER HIGHLIGHTS
Opponent: St. Louis Cardinals
Game time: 7:10 p.m.
TV, radio: FSN, 830-AM
Spectators: None, as MLB games are being played with no fans because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Pregame elements: All will be prerecorded using proper safety protocols, the team announced.
Ceremonial first pitch: Nine frontline health care workers will join to throw the first pitch together: Berhane Gebre-Egziabher (an environmental services staff member at Hennepin County Medical Center), Catherine Gonzalez-Klang (an interpreter at HCMC), Richard Gray (a doctor at HCMC), Sophia Kim (a doctor at North Memorial Health Hospital), Dee Matara (a registered nurse at Methodist Hospital), Andrew Olson (a hospitalist at M Health Fairview Bethesda Hospital), Laurie Taylor (a lab technician at Lakeview Hospital), Vanessa Tschetter (an ICU nurse at M Health Fairview Ridges Hospital) and Kaila Vang (a progressive care nurse at Regions Hospital).
Anthems: "The Star-Spangled Banner" will be performed by Gospel artist Jovonta Patton. "Lift Every Voice and Sing" will be performed by Grammy Award winners Sounds of Blackness.
Moment of silence: For Twins minor leaguer Ryan Costello, who died in November in New Zealand of natural causes at age 23; victims of COVID-19; and George Floyd, who was killed on Memorial Day.
George Floyd Memorial: The team will unveil a memorial graphic on the outfield wall and will have an in-game moment of silence at 8:46 p.m. The time signifies the 8 minutes, 46 seconds Floyd had his neck compressed by a police officer before dying.

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 7/29/2020: This article about the divorce filings of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and his wife, Kellie Chauvin, should have said the case is in Washington County District Court. A coalition of local and national media partners is asking a judge to unseal court documents in the divorce proceedings of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd.
A motion filed by the coalition Monday in Hennepin County District Court said the U.S. Constitution gives the media and public access to every stage of judicial proceedings, including divorces, and that the court sidestepped protocol in presumably sealing the divorce documents.
"This is a case of utmost public concern," said the motion filed by attorney Leita Walker. "That is a reason for more transparency, not less. Indeed, it would be nothing short of absurd to grant the parties to this case more privacy than the average divorce proceeding," she wrote.
The coalition includes the Star Tribune, the Associated Press, CBS News, WCCO-TV, KSTP-TV and other Hubbard Broadcasting Inc. properties, KARE 11, the New York Times Co. and the Minnesota Coalition on Government Information.
Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce in late May, days after her husband was charged with killing Floyd on May 25 by kneeling on his neck for several minutes during an arrest.
Kellie and Derek Chauvin filed a joint motion Wednesday asking a judge to seal their divorce case, making the existence of any proceedings or court documents invisible to the public.
Their filing argued that "rage and violence" have been directed at both of them, that several credit cards were opened in Derek Chauvin's name and that both of their financial accounts were hacked, leading to attempts to secure cash advances for tens of thousands of dollars.
"Allowing public access of this [divorce] file will allow further harassment of [Kellie Chauvin] and not allow privacy in this matter," said the Chauvins' filing.
They also argued that publicizing hearings in the case would make Kellie and Derek Chauvin's whereabouts known and "negatively affect the parties from a safety standpoint."
The move came the same day they were both charged in Washington County with felony tax crimes dating back to 2014. They allegedly failed to report more than $460,000 in income.
Sometime Friday, their divorce case became unavailable in the state's public court system, presumably because a judge had granted the Chauvins' request.
The media coalition argued that the Chauvins cited "only cursory proposed findings" to justify sealing the case and that the court failed to provide the public and media an opportunity to be heard on the matter before the case disappeared from the public section of the electronic docketing system.
Case law and precedent have imposed a high threshold for sealing divorce cases, the coalition noted.
"That the divorce proceedings may be an attempt to shield the couple's assets from criminal forfeiture or from recovery by the Floyd family in their civil lawsuit serves only to increase the public interest in those proceedings," the coalition argued. "Likewise, the probability that this case will involve information relevant to the felony tax fraud charges filed against the couple makes transparency in the proceedings all the more important."
The motion noted that the Star Tribune previously successfully moved the court to unseal the divorce files of the late musician Prince Rogers Nelson and Manuela Testolini, and the files of Attorney General Keith and Kim Ellison.
State case law has found that divorce filings should be public and that sealing them is an "extraordinary deviation," the motion said. Other measures can be taken to protect Kellie Chauvin, such as security at court hearings, the coalition argued.

Full text: The Rev. Edrin Williams, pastor of one of the most racially diverse churches in the Twin Cities, quickly launched an emergency food distribution center when rioting after the death of George Floyd destroyed neighborhood stores. Now he's taken on another role as well: dispensing food for thought to white faith leaders grappling with how to combat racism.
"I get calls nearly every day from around the country and even one from Switzerland," said Williams, of Sanctuary Covenant Church in north Minneapolis. "They ask, 'What should we be doing?' "
The national spotlight on racial inequities has injected new energy and placed new demands on African American religious leaders, long at the forefront of civil rights movements. Many are orchestrating their largest-ever food relief projects, fielding outreach from allies, working to quell community tensions and exploring new strategies to combat racial injustice.
A group of Twin Cities Black pastors has been discussing a proposal with Gov. Tim Walz to create a Minnesota "social compact" that would forge new investments and public policies to begin erasing racial inequities. Wayman African Methodist Episcopal Church in Minneapolis is preparing to launch a project to transform one Minneapolis public school into a culturally appropriate model for Black achievement.
Minnesota's evangelical community has created what it hopes will be a $1 million fund to support African American churches. Many Black pastors are in demand for speaking and consultation. And, for the first time, their food programs are attracting armies of white volunteers.
"There's something special happening at this moment," said Williams. "People are seeing the [racial] barriers who haven't seen them before. There's a captive audience."
Bishop Richard Howell of nearby Shiloh Temple International Ministries marveled that while participating recently in a panel before largely white religious leaders, the first question directed to him was, "What is systemic racism?"
"There's an openness to hearing us -- finally -- in a manner we haven't seen before,'' said Howell. "I've been preaching 40 years, and I've never seen our friends listen to the facts, and the painful facts, of African American history. We have an opportunity to share what we know with those who don't."
Whether it's just a flash of racial consciousness, or something deeper, is the big question, he said.
Surge of white volunteers
On a recent Friday, Williams stood in front of about 90 volunteers in his church parking lot. Wearing shorts, a T-shirt and face mask, he bowed his head and said a prayer moments before hundreds of neighbors streamed in to pick up groceries and other goods.
With the Cub Foods across the street still boarded up, they stopped at tents with signs announcing what was inside -- apples, carrots, diapers. It's a massive undertaking created in just two months, assisted on the ground mainly by white volunteers from cities and suburbs.
How to tap that surge of support -- from individuals, religious groups, businesses and philanthropy -- and harness it to tackle institutional racism is a topic of great discussion. While grateful for the support, many Black faith leaders worry that volunteers leave with no greater understanding of the racial inequities that shaped the community they're serving.
That understanding, along with deeper personal relationships in the Black community, are needed to become strong allies for change.
"If George Floyd hadn't taken place, we wouldn't have these relations," said the Rev. Runney Patterson of New Hope Baptist Church in St. Paul. "We've had some in the past, but they fizzled out. I tell [white] pastors, 'Don't come here just to feel good.'… My hope is we can build real relationships and be intentional about it."
Building bridges
Bridging such divides has long been a mission of the Rev. Richard Coleman of Wayman AME Church. He oversees a monthly Bridge of Reconciliation luncheon for pastors and community leaders -- of different races -- focused on supporting north Minneapolis.
During this month's Zoom meeting, Coleman announced that his church and the Minneapolis nonprofit Hope United CDC planned to organize a network of community partners to help transform one Minneapolis school into a model for academic achievement by offering training for cultural competencies, curriculum, mentors and other services.
The project would mark Wayman's 101st anniversary.
"With the moment, the killing of George Floyd, we wanted to pick something big and significant that can really make a difference," Coleman said. "There's a lot of energy right now. To deal with the problems in the Black community requires a systemic approach, and I believe we are in that space now."
The Rev. Alfred Babington-Johnson, CEO of the Stairstep Foundation in Minneapolis, also hopes to seize the moment. He and other clergy involved in His Works United, an ecumenical collaboration of African American religious leaders, have been talking with Walz and staff about a sweeping proposal to address racial disparities in housing, health, wealth and education.
It is designed to have Black-led organizations develop the capacity to address their community's issues, he said.
Sitting at his desk, Babington-Johnson pulled up a PowerPoint slide listing about a dozen Black-led organizations behind the plan, including the Minnesota Black Chamber of Commerce and the Phyllis Wheatley Center in Minneapolis. Community supporters include the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce, Greater Metropolitan YMCA and Minneapolis St. Paul Regional Economic Development Partnership.
"We're having some very hopeful conversations with government, with corporate leadership," said Babington-Johnson. "What we have is the opportunity to be of service, because the whole society is riveted" by the inhumanity surrounding Floyd's death.
Other Black clergy are forging different paths. The Rev. Stacey Smith, senior pastor at St. James AME Church in St. Paul, typically isn't orchestrating protest marches. But she felt compelled to organize a clergy march last month, during which hundreds of faith leaders prayed silently while walking the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul where violence had erupted.
The idea took shape on a Sunday night, when she began e-mailing invitations. By Tuesday morning she found herself walking past Floyd's memorial -- in the largest march of faith leaders in memory.
"It was an outpouring unlike anything I've seen," she said.
Smith's church already is running a food program. Now she'd like to offer counseling and support for people suffering from trauma, whether from the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty or racism. She had considered the idea earlier but is convinced now is the time.
African American churches are getting support from other corners. Transform Minnesota, the umbrella group for Minnesota's evangelical Christians, was planning to raise money to support African American churches suffering financially because of COVID-19. That idea kicked into high gear after Floyd's death. It launched the One Fund with a goal of raising $1 million before the anniversary of Floyd's death on May 25, said Carl Nelson, CEO of Transform Minnesota.
"It's one way to tangibly respond to the disparities we're now talking about," Nelson said.
As faith leaders look ahead, they remain hopeful, but guarded, about the prospects for societal change.
They recall that police killings of other Blacks nationally and locally, including Jamar Clark in 2015 in the Twin Cities, have ignited public attention and mobilized communities. But the outcry subsided.
"These things have been cyclical," said Babington-Johnson. "The difference this time is that folks are becoming aware of the inhumanity [confronting Blacks] in different and deeper ways -- and the need for society to change."

Full text: In the wake of George Floyd's killing and nationwide protests that followed, 32 Minnesota ad agencies have promised to disclose their racial employment data and hire more people of color in the hopes of having a staff that more closely reflects society's diversity.
In the last few weeks, Fallon, Carmichael Lynch, Colle McVoy, Padilla, Periscope, Solve and other advertising and marketing mavericks joined the #CommitToChange effort led by 600 & Rising, the newly formed nonprofit that is shining a spotlight on the persistent lack of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Indians in advertising.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of ad managers who are Black shrank from 0.8% in 2010 to 0.7% last year. The percentage of Asians rose from 2% to 7%, while Hispanics, at 9%, and Native Americans, at 1%, stayed the same.
Desperate for change, two Black advertising executives from Minnesota and New York founded 600 & Rising and published an open letter to the industry last month. They asked ad agencies to publicly release their race employment data and improvement plans.
The letter, which now has 3,000 signatures, has helped convince many ad agencies to pledge to release race numbers and improve hiring and training. Similar racial equity efforts are brewing
in law firms and media outlets.
For ad firms, "We're at 90 agencies nationwide right now and 32 in Minneapolis. That is a pleasant surprise," said Nathan Young, president and co-founder of 600 & Rising and Group Strategic director at Periscope in Minneapolis.
Until now, agencies were unwilling to disclose race data, he said. That's changing since George Floyd's killing by police and public outcries to end systemic racism.
"Now, some [agencies] said 'We want to make sure that at least 50% of the people we hire are people of color or that 50% of the applicants are.' Others are investing in internships programs. We left it up to the agencies to make their own commitments," said Young, one of 179 employees to walk out of Periscope earlier this month, when the Wisconsin parent company, Quad, ordered workers to remove any references to the phrase Black Lives Matter on social media posts.
The walkout prompted an apology from the firm's CEO, the release of employment data (showing 16 employees of color, including four Blacks out of 179 total workers) and a promise to conduct diversity training and hire more people of color.
#CommitToChange advocates at advertising and marketing firms that represent brands like 3M, Target, Land O'Lakes, Walgreens, Subaru, and the Minnesota Twins, said having an inclusive creative team can make ads richer with input that represents larger segments of the population.
"What gets measured gets action. It's an act of courage and transparency to share with the world where we are today," said Mike Caguin, chief creative officer at Colle McVoy and board chairman of the BrandLab, an internship program designed to introduce students of color to the ad industry. "When George Floyd was killed, everyone here was deeply affected by that. Much like the rest of the world, we took a look in the mirror … [Joining #CommitToChange] is about how we can contribute to making our community and industry better than we are today."
For a decade, Colle McVoy worked with the BrandLab nonprofit to hire high school and college students of color as interns and introduce them to advertising careers. But there is more to do, Caguin said.
A week ago, Colle McVoy posted on Twitter that 90% of its 240-member Minneapolis staff was white. The company website now states a promise. "We will recruit more BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, people of color] employees at all levels across the agency. We will mentor, champion and advance BIPOC employees into senior roles . … We will conduct more anti-racism training for managers and the agency."
Carmichael Lynch CEO Marcus Fischer said his Minneapolis firm will soon post its racial makeup on Instagram. People of color comprise 12% of all its workers. "But if we look around the office? It is not where we want to be. It is not reflective of the population," Fischer said. Black employees represent 1.7% of all workers. Whites comprise 87.7%.
After a decade of financing BrandLab internships, mentoring and working with ADColor and the American Advertising Federation's Mosaic Center for Multiculturalism, more initiatives are in the works to boost recruiting and retention.
"Like every agency, we have always been committed but our efforts are woefully short," Fischer said. "What Nathan [Young] and #CommitToChange have done is a great thing, because it is forcing a level of transparency and accountability."
Dorion Taylor, who worked at three Twin Cities ad agencies before becoming a director at Carmichael Lynch, said there has been some progress. But the industry is "still horrifically behind. You went from being able to count the people of color from one hand to two hands in advertising. That's a low, low percentage," said Taylor who left the agency in November to become a marketing manager at Pohlad Cos.
He wants more diverse leadership in advertising and marketing and meaningful career development.
"Not seeing others like me in any higher roles? It didn't give me a lot of hope that there really was opportunity for me for advancement," Taylor said. "A lot of agencies can probably tout they hired a person of color, but they have not done a good job of developing [leaders]. That is a huge problem."
And nationally, said Christopher Boulton, an associate communications professor at University of Tampa who wrote his doctoral dissertation on race in advertising.
"Despite four decades of seeking to 'expand the pipeline' of Black employees through small, targeted scholarships and internships, advertising maintains a Black/white labor gap that is 38% larger than the labor market in general," he said.
Change will require firms to make their race numbers public. "To me, that single demand will make the most impact. So [product makers] can see if their ad agency is being hypocritical," Boulton said. "The hope is that the exposure will shame advertisers into firing bad actors."
Young agreed. "It's the public pressure that has been compelling these agencies to act. We've had decades and decades to fix this problem."
Soon 600 & Rising plans to ask product makers to follow the lead of diversity trendsetters like General Mills and Verizon. "They already have diversity requirements," for their creative teams, sometimes requiring that 20% of the team be comprised of people of color, Young said.
Fischer at Carmichael Lynch said his goal is more than numbers. Retention is just as important as hiring.
"The industry as whole has high turnover," he said. "So making sure that our culture is welcoming and inviting to everyone is important, so they want to be part of [the company] and feel they can bring their full selves."

In the ashes of the Third: The police station's destruction is celebrated, decried, pondered

Full text: Charred, boarded up, spray painted and fenced off, the abandoned Third Precinct station sits at E. Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue in Minneapolis -- Stars and Stripes still flying -- as a nation comes to grips with what the fall of the police station means.
Home to the four Minneapolis officers involved in killing George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, the complex was a focus of the explosive protests. When it went up in flames on May 28, there was shock and disbelief.
"It was like watching your house burn down," said retired Minneapolis police officer Val Goligowski, who worked in the station for more than two decades.
The destruction of a police station is unprecedented in modern U.S. police history. The last time one was destroyed appears to have been in the New York Draft Riots of 1863, when a deadly race riot erupted targeting African Americans, said University of Nebraska policing historian Samuel Walker.
In interviews, people described what the fall of the Third meant to them: a deep betrayal of trust, a loss of control, a symbol of change and a breaking point.
"We're done backing down. We're [done] rolling over. We're done dying," said protester Queen Jacobs.
In a 1985 Star Tribune article about the opening of the new Third Precinct building, it was hailed as state-of-the-art station, designed to be more inviting. It had skylights and an atrium and resembled a middle school. It was supposed to be a new day in policing.
"We want to break down the stereotyped police station atmosphere that people are afraid to come into," then-Deputy Police Chief Bob Lutz said at the time. Then-Precinct Capt. Al Pufahl called the new station "a symbol of law enforcement" that "says something to people who will be working in and around it."
Today, the future of the building itself is uncertain. But what its fall meant is distinct to many.
Queen Jacobs, 26, protester
Jacobs, a north Minneapolis swim instructor, said the killing of George Floyd moved her to protest for the first time in her life. She protested for about eight days straight, she said, getting tear gassed, Maced and flashbanged.
It was about midnight, Jacobs said, when she finally got to the Third Precinct on May 28. It was already ablaze, and she stood in shock with the crowd watching the flames leap. Jacobs, who is Black, described the experience as "liberating."
"I think we all felt a sense of strength and community, and of a piece of what our ancestors went through, and when they were able to be liberated," she said. "We showed them, by physically removing them from what should be their safe place. We can't go outside and be safe, so why should they be able to hide in that building with all their weapons?
"If they don't want to hear us asking and begging to be treated like humans ... if they can't treat us like humans ... then I am not going to be quiet, and I'm not going to be peaceful, and they're going to hear me one way or another."
Joey Sandberg, 55, retired MPD sergeant
Sandberg, a native of south Minneapolis, spent 31 years in the Third Precinct before retiring in 2018. He picked the precinct and chose to stay, he said, "to work in the community I grew up in." He watched the station burn on television at his house.
"That was my home for 31 years. I did the very, very best I could do in police work to serve my people," he said. "To see that go up in flames like that was very hard for me to take."
Sandberg said he remains troubled by Mayor Jacob Frey's order for officers to evacuate the precinct as protesters continued the onslaught.
"I couldn't sleep that night. I was just fuming," he said. "I could not believe that the politicians would just do this. That's not just a building to us, it's a symbol of pride for us."
The officers remaining at the Third that night felt completely abandoned, he said. "A lot of them feel like they were left for dead."
"I gave my heart and soul to that precinct," he said. "To see those people cheering and throwing rocks ... it almost seemed like all the work I did for 31 years was for nothing."
James Works, 47, resident near Third Precinct station
There is no love lost between Works and the Third Precinct. Works, who is Black, is a food delivery driver who works along Lake Street. Over the years officers have repeatedly pulled him over, he said, without good reason and harassed him.
In 2017, he went to the police station to take the matter to a supervisor but was tossed out and cited for trespassing. A lawyer got the ticket dropped, Works said, and obtained bodycam footage from inside the station. It shows one officer referring to Works using an expletive.
Still, Works said the station house should not have been destroyed. He's a veteran, he said, and feels strongly about law and order. He watched it burn from his apartment.
"Even though I have issues with the police, I feel like they shouldn't have given up the police station," Works said. "They should have stood their ground. Once you take down a police station, anything goes."
"We still need to uphold the law," said Works, who said his father is a deputy sheriff in Georgia. He called the station house a symbol -- not of authority, "but of what we stand for, like law-abiding citizens."
Burning down a precinct station doesn't change the department's culture, he said.
"They're going to be right back there with the same officers doing the same stuff," he said, and we "got nowhere."
Juno Choi, 41, business owner
Choi and the other co-owners of Arbeiter Brewing say they have no idea how their startup was spared from damage. The brewery, which sits in a brick building a few doors down from the Third Precinct station, hadn't even opened yet when the protests began.
The first two days, they stood guard. On the third, they boarded up and went home, not knowing what would be left the next day. Choi said he felt torn between protecting the business and joining in the protests.
"We don't exactly know why our building did not burn down," said Choi. "I think it had a lot to do with luck."
The deserted station represents more than a Minneapolis precinct, he said. "It has become sort of symbolic of police brutality and systemic racism across the country. It was really a protest about what's been going on all across the nation for a long, long time."
It's also a constant reminder now, said Choi, of why his group wanted to start their brewery: to create a gathering space for people to talk, exchange ideas and build their community. With a bit more luck, that will start happening next month, after Arbeiter Brewing's grand opening.
Jacob Frey, 39, mayor of Minneapolis
To many, Frey's decision to evacuate the Third Precinct station is the moment he lost control of the city. Gov. Tim Walz the next day called the city's handling of the riots an "abject failure." But Frey says he'd had several conversations with Walz earlier and that the governor had never disagreed with the Third Precinct strategy in those conversations.
"There will be things I look back on and wish I would have done differently, but the decision regarding the Third Precinct is absolutely not one of them," he said. "If I had ordered the chief to hold the precinct at all costs, hand-to-hand combat would have been inevitable. There was a possibility of serious injury or even death."
Frey said he and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo were united on a strategy with three goals: to preserve life, to protect property in other neighborhoods and to de-escalate the situation. "The route we took accomplished all three," Frey said.
"There were no good options on the table," he said. "Imagine what would have happened to our city if either an officer or a member of the public was killed. The crisis we would have experienced would have dwarfed even what we saw."
Jennifer Starr Dodd, 36, emergency relief worker
Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, about two blocks from the Third Precinct station, still operates the emergency relief program it started during the protests when the neighborhood lost its grocery stores. A recent Wednesday finds site manager Starr Dodd coordinating volunteers under a shade tree as families line up.
In the charred police station, Starr Dodd sees the pain and injustice people of color have experienced. She also sees hope.
"People aren't going to be quiet anymore," she said. "People are moving forward. They're going to fight and protest until there is justice for all. It represents the hope to end police brutality, a clean slate."
"I think of it as the Pentecost," she said, referring to the Christian holiday following Easter when the Holy Spirit visited the followers of Jesus and flames appeared. "It's like a holy anger. The spirit came and it was a great fire, and everybody changed in that moment of Pentecost. I see the burning of the Third Precinct as the same. It changed everyone, whether they like it or not."
Melanie Majors, 53, executive director, Longfellow Community Council
At first, Majors said, the destruction shocked her. It wasn't the buildings, she said. What she saw was destroyed jobs and investments, loss of access, loss of visitors to the neighborhood and a destroyed sense of safety.
"Later," Majors said, "I thought this place [the Third Precinct station] right there made this community a target, and what does that mean for the future?
"You've got four officers now who have been charged, and no one knows what those outcomes are going to be," she said.
"If there are outcomes that are really offensive to the community, and the Third Precinct is still in greater Longfellow, then that makes the area a target again. We just got past this crisis period. If we will be a target again in the future, what message would that send to those who A) want to rebuild and B) who have invested in the rebuilding?"
Majors said outrage over police treatment of Black people isn't new for her. She said her father, who was Black, was brutalized by Minneapolis police through the 1970s. She has seen outrage come and go.
Majors said she fears that once the outrage passes, people trying to make changes will "hit the political and financial wall."
"The symbol keeps people's eyes open, but I don't know that they provide for sustained change over time."

Full text: Graduate school students at the University of Minnesota are pressuring faculty to respond to the nation's racial reckoning by improving the academic climate and diversifying their departments and curriculum.
Students in three departments at the U let out their long-simmering frustrations with faculty in open letters following the May 25 killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. They are calling on professors and department heads to update curriculum to address systemic racism and create a learning environment that is welcoming to all students, not just those who are white.
"What we see is faculty members getting tenure, becoming full professors, moving up the ladder … whereas what we're experiencing is behavior from those faculty that is incredibly problematic that has gone unaddressed for years," said Joy Hamilton, a Ph.D. candidate in the U's Communication Studies Department.
Hamilton and other communication studies graduate students are pushing for several changes within their department: They want administrators to prioritize hiring people of color for tenure-track positions and they want faculty to come up with plans to "combat anti-Blackness in their classrooms," among other things. The Communication Studies Department, they say, has long favored white students for preferred teaching assignments and research assistantships.
If their demands aren't met, the students threatened in their open letter to warn prospective graduate students and faculty hires of the department's "inability to create an equitable, anti-racist environment."
Department Chairman and Prof. Robert Walter Greene said faculty have since committed to inviting more Black and Indigenous speakers to research seminars, increasing graduate student representation at faculty meetings, and prioritizing candidates of color for open teaching positions.
The action by University of Minnesota students coincides with ongoing protests and discussions over racism and inequality that have taken place across the country since Floyd's death. Students in the Minnesota State system of public universities and community colleges have also pressured leaders to update their law enforcement programs using an "anti-racism and equity-focused lens."
Sociology students at the U called on faculty to review their curricula in early June after learning that two of the officers charged in Floyd's death were former undergraduates in the department. In a joint statement, sociology students expressed "disbelief, anger and disappointment" in response to a department message urging them to direct any media inquiries about past students to public relations staff.
"The murder of George Floyd has brought to light our department's complicity in systemic racism and anti-Blackness," the students' statement said.
The Sociology Department issued a statement a few days later, conveying regret that its initial message to students "was not clear" and "caused additional harm." The department wrote in its statement that it will develop strategies to support students of color and review curricula to ensure it "challenges systemic racism, anti-Blackness, and state violence."
In the U's Ecology, Evolution and Behavior department, graduate students say they have grown frustrated by "persistent instances of discriminatory behavior and racism," according to an open letter. The department does not have a sufficient system for students to anonymously report harassment or racism, the students say, which makes it difficult to hold faculty accountable.
Students have asked faculty to participate in a series of mediated discussions about racism in academia. They also want the department to establish a task force on diversity, equity and inclusion and are asking the larger College of Biological Sciences to hire a diversity and inclusion officer -- a position that exists in other U colleges.
"Faculty are uniquely positioned to be leaders in these efforts," the students' letter said. "Faculty -- especially tenured faculty -- are relatively permanent members of the EEB community with much greater power, security, and institutional knowledge."
Associate Prof. Emilie Snell-Rood is working with Ecology, Evolution and Behavior leaders to address student concerns. The department recently held a mediated Zoom listening session on racism with more than 125 students, faculty and staff. These open discussions will continue, Snell-Rood said, and faculty will soon begin meeting in small groups to increase their own awareness of racism.
The department is also working to establish the requested task force and is joining students' call for the hiring of a diversity and inclusion officer in the college, she said.
"I think in general we have been dismayed to hear from the students that our graduate program, it's not experienced by all of them as a welcoming and nurturing environment," Snell-Rood said. "We join with the students in recognizing that racism is a significant problem in the field and in science and academia."

Gun violence eclipses usual spike: Surge in Minneapolis since George Floyd's death comes amid debate over the future of policing.

Full text: At least 275 people have been victims of gunfire in Minneapolis so far this year, eclipsing the entire annual totals of all but two of the past 10 years, according to Police Department records.
Gun violence tends to spike in the city every year during the hot summer months, but this year's surge in shootings dating back to the unrest after the death of George Floyd is worse than usual.
MPD records show that 269 people were shot in Minneapolis in all of 2019 -- a grim milestone that the city reached on July 20 this year. The shooting tally is also nearly 60% higher than the five-year average for this time of the year, records show.
The city's 37 homicides have also nearly doubled from this time last year.
Victims were mostly concentrated in the Fourth and Third precincts. They included a 14-year-old girl who was grazed by a wayward bullet while she lay in bed and a taxi driver who was killed when he confronted two men breaking into his cab.
The recent upswing in violence has factored into a fierce debate over the future of policing in Minneapolis, as elsewhere, sparked by Floyd's death and the ensuing riots: Some law enforcement groups and their supporters have cited the spiking gun violence as reminiscent of the "Murderapolis" era of the mid-90s, while activists argue that the recent bloodshed is proof that the existing public safety system isn't working.
On Friday, the City Council adopted a revised 2020 budget that cuts roughly $1.5 million from the MPD's $193 million budget -- most of which was to be diverted to the Office of Violence Prevention, which may use the money to fund a program patterned after the Cure Violence program that uses trusted "messengers" to mediate street conflicts and persuade high-risk youth to take a different path.
Meanwhile, police officials and community leaders have been searching for solutions to the problem.
Around the time of the unrest, the department combined several investigative units to form the Gun Violence Response Unit, which is focused on getting weapons off the streets and applying pressure on gangs that authorities say are driving most of the violence. The strategy has paid off in some ways, with court filings showing that authorities are close to solving several recent shootings, including the June 21 running gun battle in Uptown in which more than 70 rounds were fired and 11 people were injured. Investigators have identified at least one of the suspected gunmen involved, a member of the FreeShotz gang, thanks to an informant's tip. Police say they are also on track to top last year's total of 946 recovered guns.
Department brass have reshuffled staff to beef up the patrol division, although some in the department argue those efforts have fallen short of covering all the staffing gaps created by recent departures.
Police Chief Medario Arradondo and Mayor Jacob Frey have sought help dealing with the crime spike from federal law enforcement agencies including the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Secret Service.
Kyle Loven, a former FBI agent, said in an earlier interview that it's not uncommon for "local police chiefs and sheriffs" to partner with the feds, who can add considerable manpower and crime-fighting technology.
"The FBI has a lot of technology at its disposal that it can bring to bear to assist local departments," said Loven, who left the bureau after 22 years to join a Minneapolis-based digital forensics firm.
Some activist groups on Friday expressed their disappointment that the proposed cuts fell far short of the $45 million they had sought.
"With our communities facing a pandemic, an economic crisis, and an unreformable police department, we demanded a major budget cut from MPD, and funding to meet our communities basic needs. The Mayor and the Council need to move much, much faster on their commitments to transformative change. Justice cannot wait another year," Sheila Nezhad of Reclaim the Block said in a news release.
Community groups such as Racial Justice Network and Communities United Against Police Brutality have accused the council of acting hastily and recklessly in announcing their desire for abolition, without offering any specific plan on how to deal with the violence that continues to affect poor, ethnically diverse neighborhoods.
Statistics show that the 275 shooting victims through Thursday are higher than any other yearly total over the past decade, with the exception of 2017 and 2016, when 280 and 341 people were shot, respectively. The most recent year for which comprehensive data were available was 2006, when the city logged 339 shootings.
Other cities have experienced a similar rise in shootings, notably Chicago and New York. Nationally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an uneven effect on crime, although several large cities have seen upticks in violence since the unrest that followed Floyd's death.
Some criminologists say the causes are unchanged -- inadequate housing, systemic racism, poverty and other forms of neglect, coupled with a seemingly bottomless supply of illegal firearms. Adding to that combustible mixture is the pandemic and the unrest following Floyd's death, they say.
Additionally, authorities say that violent crime tends to escalate around this time of the year, not only because warmer weather is drawing more people outside, but because the summer months have so many death anniversaries of slain high-profile gang members.
Many of the victims have been young Black males, such as Elijah Whitner, 20, who was gunned down July 10 near Farview Park in a shooting that also left his pregnant girlfriend seriously injured.
In another example, a 17-year-old boy was shot outside a South Side convenience store Thursday, blocks from the Floyd memorial site, after what police say was a struggle with a longtime rival.
Jamar Nelson had left the store minutes earlier and was driving past when he saw the boy lying on the ground and stopped to help, thinking at first that he may have overdosed. But as he got closer, he noticed the blood pooling around the body and immediately started to perform CPR with the help of a bystander. Nelson said the boy briefly regained consciousness but ended up dying in his arms before paramedics arrived.
Nelson, who is part of the street outreach group A Mother's Love, recounted the episode tearfully Friday, saying that the boy reminded him of his own son who is about the same age.
"That was somebody's baby, and at that point, he was my baby, you know, holding that boy," he said. "I had to call my son, and he said, 'I'm at work and I can't talk right now,' and I said, 'I just wanted to tell you that I love you.' "

STREETSCAPES: HOW RACE HAS SHAPED OUR URBAN ENVIRONS

Full text: Special to the Star Tribune
Neighborhoods and the buildings in them are cultural expressions of the people who built and shaped them over time. In the Twin Cities, African Americans, Indigenous people, Jews and others were often denied the opportunity to design, build, work and even live in certain areas.
In the unrest following the killing of George Floyd, it's time to take a hard look at who has the power to shape our environment today.
We talked with three nationally recognized Black architects about practicing architecture in Minnesota: James Garrett Jr., the owner and managing partner at 4RM+ULA architects in St. Paul; Mohammed Lawal, CEO and principal architect at LSE Architects in Minneapolis; and Brazilian-born Damaris Hollingsworth, owner of Design by Melo. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.
Limited urban exposure
To Garrett, many of the buildings and streetscapes in the metro area are uninviting for many of the people who live here.
"A major reason," he said, "is that the majority of architects and people in charge of the built environment -- from
city officials to planners and designers -- are not from cities.
"Their formative years were often spent in bastions of homogeneity, such as small towns and newer suburbs, where there were few people of color or recent immigrants."
A limited exposure to urban living accounted for mistakes like the 1970s closing of Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street, then a thriving neighborhood, to build a suburban-scaled Kmart.
Garrett, Lawal and Hollingsworth also said that design for public housing projects often isolated people in their apartments and that public art in the cities often had little local or cultural references.
They also said they felt the need to speak out after Floyd's death.
"I've been exhausted and talking a lot," said Garrett, who has been part of stories in national architecture magazines, podcasts and social media posts.
"Each one of us is a firm owner," Lawal added. "We understand the importance of our voices as business leaders. But we must nurture more minority-led architecture firms to expand our impact."
A fresh approach
The practice of architecture is imbued with so many white cultural norms and procedures that most people never question them.
For example, architects who are working on public projects are generally required to facilitate "public participation" and get local input in shaping the design. But Garrett, Lawal and Hollingsworth agreed that the process, determined by largely white firms, doesn't work well for people of color.
Public participation events for new libraries, schools and parks tend to adhere to a strict schedule, beginning and ending on time. But for audiences who have felt left out for generations, that is not the best approach.
"For public project meetings, I tell my clients that if you're asking me to lead this event, I reserve the right to stay as long as people have questions," said Lawal.
When he was designing the award-winning Sumner and Webber Park libraries in Minneapolis, Lawal stayed well into the night at several meetings until every voice was heard.
Hollingsworth questioned the value of formal public participation, arguing that public meetings don't work for people who have hourly jobs or children.
"Public comment sessions are often poorly promoted," she added, citing a recent St. Paul project in the Rondo neighborhood where announcement fliers appeared in neighbors' doors the night before the event.
In their practices, all three architects said they strive to talk directly with people in neighborhood settings such as barber shops, churches, mosques and senior living centers.
"That's why I de-emphasize the importance of all this public meetings foolishness and lift up the significance of other means of engaging," Garrett said. "People who attend public design input sessions tend to be older, whiter and wealthier. They have the time on their hands."
A largely white profession
There are fewer registered Black architects in the state than there were 20 years ago, said Lawal. Today, there are only 18.
In relatively homogenous states like Minnesota, reasons for this disparity include a lack of role models, access to mentors and the cost of attaining an architecture degree.
In 1992, Lawal founded the Twin Cities chapter of the Architectural Youth Program to introduce minority high school students to architecture. The program included visits to design offices, building tours and personal mentoring. In its 17 years, about 1,000 students went through the program and several became architects.
"Our real goal was to raise their sense of potential," Lawal said. "To encourage these kids to explore career options and to go to college."
Yet, despite such efforts, the profession remains largely white.
"A lot of Minnesota firms say they want to become more diverse, but claim that it's difficult to find talented, BIPOC architects here," Garrett said. "I respond, 'Then go look outside the state. … There are a number of quality architecture programs at historically Black colleges and universities.' I can name dozens of people whose talent could be recruited to come here -- and make a great impact."
Garrett acknowledged that "after George Floyd's murder, many larger design firms are talking more about equity and offering to do pro bono work in underserved, poor communities. But will they still care four months or four years from now?"
Lawal added, "We live with a history of structural racism that's been around for 400 years. Diversifying who gets to shape the built environment is going to take a much deeper structural change than talk of good intentions from our profession."

Walz signs landmark bill on police reform

Full text: Twenty-five days after George Floyd's death by Minneapolis police, top lawmakers in Minnesota's divided Legislature came together in a third floor Capitol conference room for their first substantive talks on police reform.
House Democrats, led by members of the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, had put forward a far-reaching list of proposals, from use-of-force restrictions to voting rights for felons. Senate Republicans, wary that the House plan went too far, countered with an offer that included some, but not all of the DFL ideas.
Offers traded throughout the long night went nowhere. At dawn the following morning, June 20, the Legislature adjourned at loggerheads, ending an inconclusive special session. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said the sides appeared "a session away" from agreement.
Fast forward to Thursday, and Gov. Tim Walz was signing a bill ushering in some of the most substantial changes to law enforcement and police accountability in a generation, sweeping legislation that cleared both chambers with broad bipartisan support. The new law, which takes effect Aug. 1, includes bans on chokeholds and warrior-style trainings, a duty for officers to intervene in misconduct, and changes to provide more data and independent oversight on police matters.
Walz called it "meaningful legislation that will impact our communities in a positive way" and "a critical step toward criminal justice reform."
But for weeks, that step was far from certain, even amid waves of protests -- some of them violent -- spreading from Minneapolis to around the globe, following the viral video of Floyd's death.
"It seemed pretty bleak," said Rep. Rena Moran, a St. Paul Democrat at the center of the negotiations. "I thought that maybe we'd get one or two or three provisions."
Reaching a hard-fought compromise brought together a diverse array of lawmakers and advocates, including law enforcement groups, the business community and the families of other Minnesotans killed over the years by police. Mounting public pressure, especially from legislators representing communities of color, and personal relationships between top lawmakers from opposing parties, finally pushed the deal over a finish line that many thought they'd never reach.
"So many people worked very hard, especially [POCI] Caucus members," said House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley. "It was a team effort all around. Many law enforcement groups, including police unions, came forward to compromise. We had broad support from the business community and from both sides of the aisle."
Talks appeared to stall after the first special session. But around the July 4 weekend, with another special session coming up, more serious negotiations resumed.
Democrats and Republicans agreed on some elements of a package, but a gulf remained on key issues, including adding more citizen oversight to the state police licensing board. "We had partisan differences, we had philosophical differences, we had differences between different constituencies, all engaged on the sidelines to bring this matter at least up to a public discussion," said Republican Sen. Warren Limmer, chairman of a judiciary committee. "There were times when we just had to go back to our corners and reconsider and think about each other's thoughts and different ways to approach the goals."
Over a month of stop-and-start negotiations, the two sides exchanged at least 16 offers, according to House Speaker Melissa Hortman. At one point, Moran said she feared disagreement over a single word in one provision -- "apparent" -- could torpedo the whole deal. But amid rising frustration, she sensed a genuine desire to reach a deal.
"We had a sense of the importance of this work, recognizing that we hear the moans and groans and the cries from the community across the state ... and across the country," Moran said.
Personal relationships, including a strong working dynamic between Hortman and Gazelka, pushed legislators back to the table when negotiations became strained. Close work between Gazelka and Rep. Carlos Mariani, a St. Paul Democrat helping lead the DFL's effort, added another layer of trust.
Major police groups were brought into the process, offering input and draft language. Moran and Brian Peters, a former Brooklyn Park police commander who heads the Minnesota Peace and Police Officers Association, developed a bond over months working together previously on a deadly force working group where they shared stories about their families and experiences.
"He understood where I was coming from as I talked about police officers, as I talked about the community, as I talked about the need for a stronger relationship," Moran said. "Those things are not happening unless we are engaging each other, unless we are at the table with each other."
The influence of the deadly force working group, led by Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Attorney General Keith Ellison, went beyond building personal relationships. Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts, past president of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said the group's discussions and recommendations "helped in the process to getting us to where we are today."
The pressure wasn't just coming from activists. It also was coming from the business community. In June, the Minnesota Business Partnership and more than 80 chief executives in the state sent a letter to lawmakers calling for police accountability legislation.
"The George Floyd killing really touched a nerve for everyone," said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership. "Their employees were telling them, enough is enough. We expect action, we expect you to lead on this."
As the July special session neared, negotiators on both sides sensed they were getting closer. Hortman and Gazelka kept talks moving behind the scenes. But as they ironed out the details, internal hurdles within each majority caucus remained. Moran worked with the POCI Caucus and community activists who wanted to see even bigger changes. Convincing them to accept a pared-down package, she said, was "one of the hardest conversations I've probably had in my tenure." Some Senate Republicans remained unconvinced that any changes were needed, Limmer said.
Friday, four weeks to the day after the first negotiation fizzled, Walz facilitated a conversation with Gazelka and the families of individuals who died after deadly encounters with police. Gazelka said the exchange, his second meeting with families, helped change his mind on some proposals.
"They make a compelling case for things that really, totally changed their lives," he said.
"I heard a lot of precious tears from where they are coming from. You have to take every piece of an issue, and that was one piece."
By 10 p.m. Monday, facing a self-imposed midnight deadline, the final language was rolled out and cleared by wide margins in both chambers.
"This is the beginning of the work that we set out to do," Moran said. "It is not the end."

Full text: The fired Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd was charged along with his wife Wednesday with felony tax crimes dating back to 2014 that allege failure to claim more than $460,000 in income -- at least $96,000 of that in his off-duty security work.
Derek Chauvin and Kellie Chauvin, of Oakdale, were each charged by summons in Washington County District Court with nine felony counts of aiding and abetting false or fraudulent tax returns or failing to file returns.
From 2014 to 2019, the Chauvins underreported $464,433 in joint income and owed a total of $21,853 in taxes, according to the charges. With interest and late filing and fraud penalties, they owe $37,868, the complaints said.
Derek Chauvin, 46, remains jailed on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in connection with the death of Floyd while in police custody on May 25. Three other ex-officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin.
Kellie Chauvin, 45, who has filed for divorce since her husband was charged, was not available for comment.
County Attorney Pete Orput said the investigation of the two "was in the works well before" Derek Chauvin was charged with Floyd's death in late May.
Orput said state Department of Revenue officials contacted his office in June with what they found, and "they were sending [Chauvin] letters last year" about no returns being filed, "and they got no response."
Then, when Derek Chauvin came under worldwide attention for his role in Floyd's killing, revenue officials "read the guy's name and realize this is their guy," Orput said.
The county attorney called the Chauvins' tax troubles "run of the mill, but it just happens to be the [police officer] sitting in Oak Park [Heights prison]. … The guy owes us money, and I want to collect. I don't care about his other problems."
The filing includes a litany of allegations. Among them, prosecutors say the Chauvins bought a new BMW X5 in January 2018 for $100,230 from a Minnetonka dealership and registered the SUV in Florida -- they own a condo in Windermere, outside Orlando -- and paid $4,664 in taxes in that state.
However, the vehicle was serviced 11 times in Minnetonka and never in Florida, investigators say they found. Kellie Chauvin told investigators they opted for Florida because it was less expensive. The taxes due on the SUV had it been registered in Minnesota were $5,053.
Court records do not list an attorney for either of the Chauvins. Derek Chauvin's criminal attorney, Eric Nelson, said he knows nothing about the tax allegations.
The counts and their dates are identical for the Chauvins. There are six involving aiding and abetting allegations of false or fraudulent returns starting with the 2014 tax year. The others allege not filing taxes for 2016, 2017 and 2018.
The charges document various sources of income for the couple. The complaints said that between 2014 and 2019, Derek Chauvin made between $52,000 and $72,000 annually as a police officer. He also worked off-duty security nearly every weekend in that time at El Nuevo Rodeo dance club, Cub Foods, Midtown Global Market and EME Antro Bar on E. Lake Street.
During that span, Chauvin failed to pay taxes on nearly $96,000 he earned from El Nuevo Rodeo alone, investigators estimated.
Beginning in June 2019, he routinely worked off-duty at EME Antro Bar on weekends from 11 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. after his MPD shift and was paid $250 in cash each night, said investigators, who located no corresponding tax papers.
On June 25, state revenue investigators searched the Chauvins' Oakdale home, which was mostly empty. They recovered a box of tax documents, financial information and work schedules. Investigators also searched the home of Derek Chauvin's father, an accountant who prepared their 2014 and 2015 tax returns based on information they provided him. The father said he filed an extension to do their 2016 returns, but that they never provided him with the information to complete them.
Kellie Chauvin, also known as Kellie Xiong and who worked as a real estate agent and ran a photography business, told investigators that she had not prepared the returns because "it got away" from her, the complaints said. She was accompanied by an accountant who provided income tax returns for 2016 to 2019, but they appeared incomplete or estimated, the complaints continued.
The complaints also said that on June 26, one day after their Oakdale home was searched, Kellie Chauvin called Derek Chauvin at the prison where he is being held. She told him during the recorded call that their unfiled tax returns were being investigated.
She allegedly told her husband that she was meeting with someone about "[20]16 to now." He then suggested using "who we have used to handle for many years."
She responded, "Yeah, well, we don't want to get your dad involved, because he will just be mad at me, I mean us, not doing them for years."
Also Wednesday, Kellie Chauvin's attorney requested that their divorce file be sealed, citing "constant harassment from the public."
"The circumstances surrounding Respondent's incarceration has resulted in rage and violence throughout the community directed at both Petitioner and Respondent," the filing said, adding that financial information and a Social Security number were hacked, resulting in attempts to secure cash advances for tens of thousands of dollars.
"Allowing public access of this file will allow further harassment of Petitioner and not allow any privacy in this matter," the filing said. "In addition, allowing public access will allow the public and media to have notice of when hearings occur and will allow the general public to know the whereabouts of each party during the proceedings. Such access will negatively affect the parties from a safety standpoint."

Deal reached on police reform

Full text: The Legislature reached a deal on a sweeping package of police accountability measures Monday night following two months of touch-and-go negotiations after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
The deal, one of the most substantial changes to the state's criminal justice system in years, includes a statewide ban on chokeholds and neck restraints -- such as the one used on Floyd -- and a prohibition on warrior-style training for officers. It enhances data collection around deadly force encounters, requires officers to intervene and creates a new state unit to investigate such cases. The proposal boosts funding for crisis intervention training, creates a panel of expert arbitrators to handle police misconduct cases and establishes incentives for officers to live in the communities they police.
Final votes were expected late Monday or early Tuesday.
The hard-fought agreement came after weeks of legislative impasse that had already derailed another special session in June -- one that was initially called to review Gov. Tim Walz's extension of his emergency powers. But the continuing outrage over Floyd's killing kept up the pressure on the only divided legislature in the nation to find common ground when Walz extended the state of emergency again in July.
"We've never stopped working on this, whether we were in session or out of session. That's something we all felt was important," said Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake.
Democrats' original policing proposal went further, including provisions to restore voting rights for felons and giving the responsibility for prosecuting deadly force cases to the attorney general's office. Republicans in the Senate said they insisted that the final deal wouldn't adopt any language being considered in Minneapolis to dismantle police departments, despite final deal wouldn't adopt any language being considered in Minneapolis to dismantle police departments, despite the fact that there was no provision in the DFL bill to do so.
They pushed deal-making and votes late into the night Monday, after Senate Republican imposed a deadline of midnight to either pass a deal or go home empty-handed.
"Some of us believe that you can always do more, but members this is a good bill," said Rep. Rena Moran, DFL-St Paul. "This is a beginning, this is not the end."
But in the push to get a deal on policing passed in time, other issues on legislators' to-do list fell to the wayside. A $1.35 billion package of construction projects failed in the House early Tuesday morning, after Republicans in the House criticized the package for spending too much and including too little of their input. Bonding bills require a supermajority to pass in both chambers, meaning leaders need buy-in from members of the minority parties.
The House and Senate majority "caucuses and the governor's office negotiated it without us, and that is not a good solution to earning votes from our caucus," said House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown. But he suggested that lawmakers might have another chance in August, when the Legislature is expected to return to review another potential extension of Walz's emergency powers.
Even as legislators worked furiously behind the scenes to strike a deal on policing, the two parties' contrasting priorities on racial disparities and the pandemic were evident throughout the day Monday. House Democrats passed a resolution declaring racism a public health crisis, manifesting in health, economic, educational and other disparities between Black and white Minnesotans.
"The COVID-19 pandemic and the senseless murder of George Floyd have shined a light on the historical and contemporary injustices that are still embedded in our society," said Ruth Richardson, DFL-Mendota Heights, the sponsor of the resolution.
Meanwhile, Republicans in the Senate pushed their own symbolic resolution urging Walz to allow school districts to make their own decisions on if -- and how -- they should reopen for classes in the fall. The administration has said it will make decisions on whether to resume in-person classes in the fall or continue with distance learning or a hybrid of the two.
"One person cannot know the entire state of Minnesota," said Sen. Carla Nelson, R-Rochester. "Every school building, over 2,000 school buildings, over 300 school districts, over 100 charter schools, one person cannot determine how best students can be educated during this time of pandemic."
Lawmakers are facing another automatic special session in mid-August if Walz chooses to extend his emergency powers for another 30 days.

A life's work in high demand: Peacebuilding Institute trains groups on exploring and healing racial trauma

Author: Crosby, Jackie

Full text: Amid sustained protests against police violence and calls for societal change in the nearly two months since the police killing of George Floyd, there has been a growing hunger from individuals and institutions about how to begin tackling something as vast, insidious and emotionally loaded as racism.
This is the kind of work Donna Minter has been doing for more than a decade.
A licensed psychologist with a background in social work, she established the Minnesota Peacebuilding Leadership Institute to train people and organizations how to understand racial trauma and dismantle some of their old ideas.
"People need the language," Minter said. "There are so many well-intentioned white people who want to do this work and say, 'I don't know how to start talking about it.' What we give is language to help see how racial trauma fits into a historical, structural and cultural context."
More than 4,700 people have been trained in "cultural competence" and other skills over the past decade through a range of programs that last from a few hours to an intensive five-day session. Workshops focus on trauma awareness, restorative justice and resilience and self-care.
Through the years, Minter and her assistant executive director and training partner, Crixell Shell, have worked with social workers, nurses, teachers and lawyers.
They have trained those who work in battered women's shelters, AmeriCorps Vista volunteers and environmental-advocacy groups.
They have taught those involved in the prison system working on anti-recidivism
efforts, and in the past year trained staff at the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.
The city of Minneapolis hired the Peacebuilding Leadership Institute to do 15 trainings between now and fall, funded by the city's Health Department and the Office of Violence Prevention.
While the institute has been working toward its mission of racial restorative justice for years, Minter and Shell believe the time is right for their work to broaden and take hold.
"Right now, we're the epicenter of what's happening in terms of a social justice movement," said Shell, who met Minter at the first training session in 2010 and immediately wanted to be part of the effort. "In response to what's been happening, people have had a lot of pain."
Requests for training have skyrocketed since May 25, when Floyd's death in Minneapolis sparked protests in Minnesota and around the world. For many, Floyd's death touched off soul-searching about institutional racism, the legacy of slavery and its ties to persistent racial disparities in housing, employment, education and wealth.
Since moving the training online in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, Minter and Shell have conducted 46 trainings on trauma awareness, restorative justice, resilience and self-care. Nearly 1,000 people have participated.
STAR training
The institute, at mnpeace.org, employs a training method known as STAR (Strategies for Trauma Awareness and Resilience). It was developed at the Eastern Mennonite University's Center for Justice and Peacebuilding in Harrisonburg, Va., with a $2 million grant after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
"Throughout human history, we've confused the idea of retribution with the idea of reconciliation," said Antony Stately, a psychologist who runs the Native American Community Clinic in south Minneapolis.
"STAR helps people understand what reconciliation looks like and asks us to think and imagine what social justice looks like," he said. "What do I need as a human being, as community, to be restored? That's what healing is."
Stately, an enrolled member of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, got involved with the Peacebuilding Leadership Institute several years ago when he saw the relevance in his clinical work in tribal communities.
"You are teaching people to tend to their own traumatic experiences so they can rebound or resist traumatic events. There's lots of science behind that," Stately said. "I'm not suggesting the training is a silver bullet, but it's a piece that's been missing for a long time in conversations."
Lisa Morris-Helmstetler turned to Minter and Shell for help in rooting out implicit bias and structural racism across Olmsted County, which employs about 1,400 around the Rochester area.
The impetus grew out of a 2017 initiative known as One Olmsted, which calls for health, social and racial equity.
As deputy clerk to the County Board, she sought training to begin tackling sweeping ideas, such as implementing restorative justice.
But county leaders also wanted to help create a more open workplace culture that would allow for those sometimes uncomfortable conversations between two colleagues about race and ethnic difference.
"We want to look at equity in all of our public services," Morris-Helmstetler said. "Where people are marginalized, where there are disparities. We want to hear how our services are or aren't helping, how experiences might be different from one group to the next."
Since the training in April, Morris-Helmstetler, who is white, has worked with colleagues who are Latino and Black to conduct more than half a dozen "healing circles" with employees across the county.
"A lot of people showed up, and they were willing to be vulnerable," she said. "At first it was about coping with how to move forward after George Floyd's death. People want to learn more; we're all sort of growing together."
As part of her work with the Peacebuilding Leadership Institute, Shell convenes several monthly meetings tied to a national effort called Coming to the Table.
The groups bring together descendants of those who were enslaved and descendants of slave owners to heal historical wounds of slavery.
Shell said interest in the meetings, which are free and open to the public, also has grown in recent months.
"It is a space where we can discuss issues that aren't discussed every day," Shell said. "Or if they are discussed, they create shame within us and blame between us."
New urgency
John Parker-Der Boghossian, the equity and inclusion officer at Normandale Community College in Bloomington, said he has seen the power of the healing circles play out, in conjunction with the STAR Training. He brought Minter and Shell to the college shortly after Floyd's death.
"Something is different now," Parker-Der Boghossian said. "There's a sense that we're going to do something systemic this time. And that this isn't optional."
The Peacebuilding Leadership Institute has an annual budget of about $200,000. About 30% of revenue comes from contracts with organizations, another 30% from training fees and about 20% from grants.
Its largest fundraising effort comes from Lunafest, a women's film festival normally held at the Riverview Theater in south Minneapolis. This year's virtual event will be held Aug. 26.
Even as interest rises in fighting systemic racism, Minter knows the enormity of the task.
"You can't heal institutional racism with trainings alone. Certainly not a two-hour training," she said. "It takes time and deliberate effort" to undo generations of trauma.
But she remains hopeful.
"Most people want to build peace in their lives," Minter said. "What we are doing is teaching people the tools and language and strategies to be able to know how do that."

Media band together to fight Floyd case gag rule: Coalition contends Judge Cahill's order overreached, violated First Amendment.

Full text: A coalition of local and national media companies is challenging a judge's gag order that prohibits attorneys and several others from discussing the cases against four former police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd.
The group, which includes the Star Tribune; Minnesota Public Radio; the Associated Press; local TV stations WCCO, KMSP, KARE and KSTP; and the New York Times Co., among others, filed a motion Friday asking that the gag order be vacated.
"The Court's Order in these cases threatens to prevent the press and the public from obtaining meaningful information related to these highly newsworthy prosecutions from a wide -- and overly broad -- range of interested parties," said the motion by coalition attorneys Leita Walker and Emmy Parsons.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill issued the order last week, a day after some of the former officers' attorneys spoke to the media about their cases.
"The court finds that continuing pretrial publicity in this case by the attorneys involved will increase the risk of tainting a potential jury pool and will impair all parties' right to a fair trial," Cahill wrote, adding that it covers "all parties, attorneys, their employees, agents or independent contractors working on their behalf."
The matter quickly snowballed into accusations of constitutional violations by the judge and calls by defense attorneys to arrest and sanction Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is leading the prosecution, for allegedly violating the order.
The coalition's motion argued that the order overreached and violated the First Amendment. It could be interpreted to cover "thousands" of people, including every employee of the state and Hennepin County, the motion said.
"George Floyd's death catapulted Black Lives Matter into one of the largest movements in this country's history and spurred important conversations on a number of topics that arguably 'relate' to these prosecutions," the motion said. "For that reason alone, the Order is overbroad. … The Order can be read to restrict the speech of a breathtaking number of people."
Cahill did not list by name or occupation which "agents" or parties were covered in his order. A local legal scholar and a longtime defense attorney have said they believed it would apply to several city and state officials, including Gov. Tim Walz.
The coalition's motion argued that the order could delay the government's communication to the public about efforts to address public safety, racial equity and police reform.
"The Order thus threatens the right of the press and the public to engage in important dialogue with a wide range of people on a broad range of topics that could be viewed as 'related' to these prosecutions," the motion said.
The coalition said state case law allows the court to impose gag orders "only when necessary to ensure a fair trial" but that they should be "narrowly tailored" and based on "an articulated, specific harm."
The coalition will argue its case in court on Tuesday.
On Monday, the attorneys for all four former Minneapolis officers -- Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- filed separate motions asking that Cahill's order be vacated.
Their motions argued that the order violated constitutional rights to due process, free speech and a fair trial, and that it unfairly penalized the defense after prosecutors and public officials had spent weeks criticizing the former officers' actions.
Later Monday, Ellison issued a news release announcing that he had appointed four veteran attorneys as special assistant attorneys general on the Floyd case and listed their professional accomplishments.
Attorneys Earl Gray, who is representing Lane, and Robert Paule, who is representing Thao, filed separate motions Tuesday objecting to Ellison's news release. Gray called for his arrest. Paule asked that he be sanctioned.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Prosecutors said he knelt on Floyd's neck on May 25 for nearly 8 minutes, but Kueng's body-worn camera video, shown to the media and public Wednesday, indicated it lasted about 9 minutes and 30 seconds. Ellison's office declined to address the time discrepancy, citing the gag order.
Kueng, Lane and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Police were investigating allegations that Floyd had used a fake $20 bill at a local convenience store. They held him down as he lay handcuffed, stomach-down in the street. Floyd complained several times that he couldn't breathe and warned them that he was going to die before he became unresponsive.
Bystanders also called for the officers to stop; one of them recorded and publicly shared video of the incident.

Full text: The continued surge of Minneapolis police officers seeking disability benefits after the George Floyd unrest is heightening concerns of a police staffing shortage amid a wave of violent crime.
Ron Meuser Jr., the lawyer handling the claims, said his office met with an additional 43 Minneapolis cops this week who have retained him. That's in addition to the estimated 150 officers who Meuser said at a July 10 news conference had retained him. And it brings the total closer to 200 now, out of a sworn force of about 850.
Meuser said most of the officers starting the disability paperwork leave their jobs fairly quickly on a medical leave. The disability claims process can take up to six months.
He said his office has "dozens and dozens" of more appointments with officers scheduled for next week. "The curve has not flattened," Meuser said. "We are signing up a staggering number of officers every day right now."
The increase in officers seeking to file disability claims comes as the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) faces unprecedented public criticism following the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in May. The City Council has advanced a plan that could end the police department and replace it with a broader community safety department that may or may not have licensed peace officers. Voters would have to approve the change.
Meanwhile, the city has been rocked by an explosion of gun violence.
Meuser said he thinks the city faces a significant police staffing shortage. The vast majority of officers retaining him are seasoned veterans, he said, averaging about 48 years old with at least 20 years of experience. The majority of the duty-related disability claims are for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, related to the Floyd unrest.
The stress is cumulative, he said. The unrest and hostility unleashed by the death of Floyd aggravated conditions that officers have experienced for a long time and muscled through, he said. "It further impaired their ability to cope."
According to city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie, there is no legal obligation for an officer to notify the MPD that they are submitting an application for disability benefits with the Public Employees Retirement Association, which administers the benefits plans. So the MPD does not necessarily know which officers on a temporary medical leave are seeking long-term disability. The process requires two medical reports confirming the condition, one of which must come from a licensed medical doctor.
Meuser dismissed the idea he could be drumming up business by being public about the deluge.
"I have plenty of money," he said. "If anything, the rate at which we're taking on these officers is putting a great deal of stress on me and my staff."
A spokeswoman for the city said that as of Friday, 111 MPD officers are on some type of medical leave, including 40 PTSD claims filed since May 26.
When asked about the loss of so many officers and how the MPD was coping, police spokesman John Elder said: "Staff will be moved to areas necessary to meet the primary goal of law enforcement, public safety."
Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo took up the staffing issue at Friday's City Council meeting. They confirmed that 65 officers have left the force so far this year for various reasons. The normal attrition rate is about 45 officers per year. Disability claims, however, are difficult to track, Arradondo said, because "they kind of filter in" from outside the department.
"There is also a level of people who are just going on leave in some form," Frey noted. "That also raises a flag as to whether that individual might ultimately leave in some other form, like more completely. Those wouldn't necessarily be included in the numbers that we just shared."
"It is also happening at the fire department, but the numbers are definitely higher at MPD," Frey said.
The departures add a new layer to an already contentious debate about how to reshape policing following Floyd's death, and they are factoring into the city's budget talks.
Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, during a different public meeting, noted that the MPD is currently budgeted for 888 officers but isn't likely to hit its full strength this year. He said he hopes the city will work to "right-size" the department's force and budget and consider making more investments in violence prevention.
"As we're seeing people losing faith in our … current public safety system, as we're seeing communities needing support because of the increase in violent crime, we're also seeing, quite frankly, our police force express a deep resentment of our city and abandoning our city," Ellison said. "We're seeing that in the form of officers either resigning or, you know, making claims of harm that they themselves caused and taking advantage of that."
Council Member Linea Palmisano asked him to confirm whether he was referring to the PTSD claims.
"I was referring generally to the fact that we do have officers for whatever reason, and it's not my place to say what that reason is, but we do have officers who are rushing to find their way out of their obligation to our constituents in a myriad of ways," Ellison said.
Palmisano cautioned against attributing motives to the departures and said MPD officials have assured her that officers are continuing to respond to calls. Council Member Andrew Johnson added that he wanted to encourage city workers who might be experiencing PTSD symptoms to seek help if needed.
In a separate meeting earlier this week, Arradondo cautioned against making major cuts to the force while they're struggling to rein in shootings. He noted that not all the remaining officers are available to respond to 911 calls. Some, like the chief, hold supervisory roles that require administrative work. Others, such as detectives, focus on investigating crimes after they occur.
In response to council members' questions about the adequacy of street patrols, Arradondo said the department is reorganizing units to get resources where they are needed. For example, more officers are being shifted to precincts from 911 call center work they had been doing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"It really has to be an all-hands-on-deck approach," he said.
Meuser said neither the city nor the police department has contacted him about the surge in officers seeking disability benefits.
Sgt. Sherral Schmidt, vice president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, the police union, said the union hasn't been tracking the officers starting the disability claim process, but has no reason to dispute Meuser's numbers. She said she knows that "a fair number" of officers have taken personal leaves since the unrest.
Losing 200 to 250 officers would have "a really detrimental effect on our police department and how they provide services," she said.
At last week's news conference, Meuser said that at least 13 officers were inside the Third Precinct building when Frey ordered them to evacuate. Some wrote farewells to loved ones and others told him that they were saving a bullet for themselves.
"Those are all true stories," Schmidt said, adding that she was told there were 54 officers left in the station. "I met with a cop last week … who broke down in tears and said 'My department left me in there to die.' What do you say to that?"
"Morale is probably the lowest I've ever seen it in my almost 23 years in the department," she said. "Cops are fearful they're going to show up one day and they're not going to have a job. It's affecting them and their families greatly."
When asked if the wave of disability claims could be a form of work slowdown, Schmidt called that an "absolutely ridiculous claim."
MPD officers have been accused of staging work slowdowns before. In 2016, North Side officers were accused of a work slowdown after intense public criticism officers faced for the 2015 shooting death of Jamar Clark.

Metro home sales defy recession: After two sluggish months, buyers return in force while 30-year mortgage rates hit record low.

Author: Buchta, Jim

Full text: June was one of the best on record for home sellers in the Twin Cities, according to new monthly sales data. Last month, buyers signed 6,819 purchase agreements, 6% more than last year and the most during any June in nearly two decades, according to a monthly sales report from the Minneapolis Area Realtors.
That gain was fueled in part by pent-up demand from April and May, a topsy-turvy spring market when sales declined by double-digits amid a prolonged government shutdown and metro-wide protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
"I call it 'displaced demand,' where sales activity is shifted into later months," said David Arbit, Minneapolis Area Realtors' director of research. "Record-low mortgage rates are a big motivator, especially for first-time buyers who are payment sensitive."
Mortgage rates have been declining incrementally all spring, helping offset rising home prices spurred in part by a lack of inventory. On Thursday, Freddie Mac said the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 2.98%. It's the first time rates have fallen below 3% and the lowest rate in the survey's 50-year history dating back to 1971.
Motivated by low rates, buyers are competing for a dwindling number of listings. New listings have been declining for the past three months with buyers outpacing sellers in some parts of the metro area and in certain price ranges.
At the current sales pace there were enough listings on the market to last less than two months during June across all price ranges (a balanced market has five to six months of supply), but the availability of listings varies dramatically by price range. For houses priced at more than $1 million, for example, there were enough listings to last more than 11 months.
In Minneapolis and St. Paul, fewer homes hit the market during June compared with last year, but the new listings were a slight increase from May. In all suburbs, new listings during June were down from last year and the previous month.
During June, sellers got nearly 100% of their original asking price across the metro area, causing the median price of all closings to hit $305,000. That tied a record high set in March and up more than 5% year-over-year.
Pending sales in all areas of the metro area increased during June from the previous month and last year except in Minneapolis, where pending sales declined slightly in June compared with June 2019.
Home buying in the Twin Cities typically peaks in late summer, then tapers as kids return to school and temperatures drop, but an abundance of multiple offers suggests that there are plenty of willing and able buyers who will keep shopping well into fall. But with economic headwinds looming and the threat of a winter wave of coronavirus infections, it's unclear how long the housing market will retain its resilience.
"As of right now, I don't see any signs of the market slowing down," said Kathy Borys of Coldwell Banker Realty. "The unknown is how the election will affect the market. I think that is more of an unknown than the stability of the market in the Twin Cities."
Borys expects the market to remain strong well into fall, especially in inner-ring suburbs such as St. Anthony, where Dustin and Alisa Gingerich were recently both buyers and sellers. With three kids, they'd outgrown the two-bedroom house they bought in 2008 before starting a family. With mortgage rates low and houses in their neighborhood selling quickly, they decided it was a good time to make a move.
Just after Easter they started shopping for a bigger house in the same city so their kids wouldn't have to change schools. They quickly found one they both wanted. They toured it the day it went on the market and made a full-price offer the same day. After touring it again the next morning they upped their offer, which was one of four bids on the house, by $11,000 and the sellers accepted.
Though their options as buyers were limited, Alisa Gingerich said being a seller in this market was far more difficult than being a buyer in part because of their emotional connection to their midcentury-modern house and their fear that it wouldn't be perfect enough for the market.
They listed the 2,120-square-foot house in late June for $309,000 and on the first night had two showings and at least 10 scheduled for the next day. The first person who toured the house made an offer for nearly 10% more than they were asking. Though they could have waited for a potentially higher offer from those scheduled to see it the next day, they canceled those showings and took the offer.
The decision to sell to the first person who looked at their house was made in part because the buyer had such an appreciation for the house's unusual features, including an original Thermador oven and vintage bathroom tiles, Gingerich said,
"This gentleman was the perfect buyer for the home," she said. "I'm sure that made some folks mad, but we had to do what's right for us."

NEW LISTINGS LAG BEHIND
Data on new home listings each week between February and the start of July show the dramatic slowdown in the real estate market during the pandemic lockdown and also a drop in listings, especially in Minneapolis, during the week of protests following the killing of George Floyd. Listings appear to be rebounding after the typically slow July 4th holiday week.

St. Olaf grads craft a potent Black anthem: Inspired by George Floyd, they call for "A Big Change."

Full text: They met in a St. Olaf College dorm, played in a band together at school parties and ended up as educators in Phoenix. Now Herb Ronnell and Pat Devon have teamed up on a powerful, timely new single, "A Big Change."
Inspired by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Ronnell and Devon wanted to create a positive song that celebrated Blackness and addressed racial injustice.
"I always call Herb 'the Melody Man,' " Devon said of pianist-singer Ronnell. "He played some music on the piano, and in typical fashion, he will hum and scat and sing jibber-jabber, and I'll put words to the sound. With how close this resonated with us with George Floyd, there was a lot of energy there, a lot of passion, a lot of sadness. This one happened quick."
Ronnell's melody weaves in an echo of "The Star-Spangled Banner" as he sits at a grand piano crooning in his sweet, hopeful tenor, "I know, I know a big change is coming."
Rapper Devon drops a few verses about appreciating the value of work, needing leaders to lead and bringing cops to justice. And the two musicians weave in snippets of a recent fiery speech from Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.
Imagine John Legend collaborating with Common, only with a smaller budget.
The Floyd incident shook Devon, who graduated from Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis and used to get his haircut around the corner from 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was pinned to the ground by police officers and took his final breaths.
"It rang so close to home," Devon said. "It was very surreal to think that me, my brother, my cousins, we could have very well been in that barber chair that day of the George Floyd chaos."
Two weeks ago, Devon and his wife visited that "sacred space" in Minneapolis. "It was wild to think
that these blocks where I used to hang out with my friends, this is where it all took place."
Ronnell felt an indirect connection to Floyd as well, since he used to salsa dance at Conga Latin Bistro in northeast Minneapolis, where Floyd later worked as a bouncer.
Even though he grew up mostly in Houston, Devon -- Patrick Devon Bass -- had siblings who went to St. Olaf and Carleton colleges in Northfield. After graduating, he taught English at Minneapolis North High and Osseo Learning Center before heading to Arizona, where he is now an assistant principal in the Mesa school district.
Ronnell -- Herbert Ronnell Washington -- is from Phoenix, where a high school music teacher recommended the music program at St. Olaf. After earning his degree, he headed back to the Sun Belt, where he has been affiliated with the Phoenix Boys Choir (he was once a member) for seven years, the past year as artistic director.
At St. Olaf in the '00s, Ronnell and Devon were members of a band called Fellas & A Lady, which they describe as having a "pre-Black Eyed Peas" sound. Since they ended up in Arizona, the two pals occasionally get together and make music. They've worked with Jordin Sparks and Tori Kelly.
Devon -- who has had a series of stage names including Ice Daddy and Platinum Pat -- has released one solo album, "Vintage Vibes from the Vault + Volume Won," with another one, "Where We Going Next," in the works.
Ronnell and Devon made a video of "A Big Change" in the Great Hall where the Phoenix Boys Choir performs. To add a Minneapolis touch, Devon wore a Rhymesayers hoodie in the clip while Ronnell sat at a grand piano in his quilted jacket.
"It's not flashy," Ronnell said of the video. "And it's black and white to represent where we are today.
"We want to be heard and continue the dialogue that Black Lives Matter. Once the riots and protests stop, then it's easy to get back to no change happening in the country."
"A Big Change" is available only on YouTube, not on any streaming services.

Bodycam: Cop drew gun at start

Full text: Body camera footage showed that police gave George Floyd no explanation for why they were questioning him before former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane pointed a gun, swore at him and forced him out of his vehicle.
The court made footage captured by Lane and fellow fired officer J. Alexander Kueng publicly viewable Wednesday by appointment. The videos showed that Floyd immediately grew terrified and cried as he told Lane he hadn't done anything, and that paramedics who arrived at the scene appeared unhurried after taking his pulse while he lay unresponsive in the street.
They drew strong reactions from some members of the public who viewed them.
"It was horrifying," said civil rights attorney and activist Nekima Levy Armstrong. "They did not treat George Floyd as if he was human from the moment they approached the vehicle -- holding him at gunpoint, not listening to him, not taking his concerns seriously."
Lane, Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death while he was under arrest on May 25 at E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue.
Another fired officer, Derek Chauvin, is charged with second-degree murder, third-murder and second-degree manslaughter for planting his knee into Floyd's neck, even as Floyd pleaded to breathe.
The videos showed that neither Lane nor Kueng told Floyd or his two passengers why they were being investigated until about six minutes after the encounter began and after Floyd had been handcuffed.
Prosecutors have said Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 8 minutes, but Kueng's video showed that it was about 9 minutes and 30 seconds.
Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, filed the two videos in court last week along with a motion to dismiss the charges against his client. Gray has argued that Lane was a rookie working at the direction of Chauvin, a 19-year veteran.
Lane twice asked about turning the 46-year-old Floyd from his stomach onto his side after Floyd complained that he couldn't breathe, but was rebuffed by Chauvin.
Lane also got into an ambulance and performed CPR, Gray has argued.
Lane was the first officer to engage with Floyd, and did not inform him that he was being investigated on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill at Cup Foods.
Floyd repeatedly said "please" and asked what was going on. "I didn't do nothing," Floyd said about two minutes into the video, holding his left hand in the air as he sat in the driver's seat of a car.
"Put your [expletive] hands up right now!" Lane yelled while aiming a gun at Floyd. "Let me see your other hand."
Location of hands
The videos, which had a limited vantage point, showed that Floyd began crying about two minutes into Lane's video and was reluctant to exit his car after Lane offered no explanation for the investigation.
Floyd was also reluctant to enter the squad car after Kueng had informed him about the report of a fake bill. He did not appear to fight back or flee.
According to the videos and corresponding transcripts: Lane and his partner, Kueng, were the first to arrive about 8:08 p.m. A store manager told them someone used a fake bill and directed them to a blue Mercedes SUV outside.
Floyd was in the driver's seat with his back turned to the rolled up window; he pivoted toward Lane.
"Oh!" Floyd said.
About 1 minute and 38 seconds into Lane's video, the car's windows reflected Lane holding up his gun in his right hand, pointing it toward Floyd.
"Hey, man, I'm sorry!" Floyd said, opening the car door.
"Stay in the car," Lane said.
At 1 minute and 44 seconds in Lane's video, Lane pushed the car door farther open with his left hand while pointing his gun at Floyd and ordering him to "put your [expletive] hands up."
"All right," said a visibly distraught Floyd. "What I do though? What we do, Mr. Officer?"
Floyd forced from car
Lane reached his left hand into the car and placed it on top of Floyd's left hand and part of his head. Lane began to reholster his gun about the same time.
About 2 minutes and 37 seconds into Lane's video, Lane placed his left hand on Floyd's hands and his right hand on Floyd's back inside the car and tugged on him slightly. Floyd was in tears and begged him not to shoot. Floyd was eventually removed from the vehicle. Kueng and Lane handcuffed him, with Lane twisting Floyd's right arm up at a sharp angle.
Kueng walked Floyd away from the SUV while Lane spoke to Floyd's two passengers, a man and a woman who were standing on the sidewalk. About 6 minutes into Lane's video, he told the woman they were investigating a fake bill.
About six minutes into Kueng's video, he informed Floyd about the investigation while the two are standing apart from the others.
"We're here because it sounds like you gave a fake bill to the individuals in there," he said after getting a name and birth date from Floyd, who appears to have calmed slightly. Kueng then stood him up and Floyd again began to panic, begging them not to place him in the squad.
Chauvin kneels on neck
Lane and Kueng struggled for about three minutes to get Floyd into the back of their squad.
Floyd, who told them he was claustrophobic and pleaded with them to stop, fell sideways into the car on the rear driver's side after Kueng pressed one hand on his chest and the other on his head.
Lane tried to pull Floyd in from the rear passenger side.
Floyd wheezed, telling them he just had COVID and couldn't breathe. He eventually fell out of the passenger door. By that time Chauvin and Thao were at the scene.
About 11 minutes into Lane's video, Lane grabbed Floyd's leg and helped Chauvin and Kueng flip Floyd from his back onto his stomach in the street.
The bodycam video and video recorded by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck while Floyd said he couldn't breathe, called out "mama" several times and warned that he was going to die. Bystanders also pleaded with the officers to stop. Lane's video showed that he asked twice about rolling Floyd onto his side, but did not appear to express urgency or fear in his voice.
About 16 minutes into Lane's video Floyd stopped talking and appeared unresponsive. His last words were: "Come on, man. … They killed me. They killed me. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Oh! Ah! Ah! Please, please, please."
Kueng checked Floyd's pulse, couldn't find one and appeared to move back and stopped holding onto Floyd. Chauvin and Lane continued restraining Floyd for about three minutes until paramedics arrived.
Paramedics unhurried
About 19 minutes and 40 seconds into Lane's video, a paramedic arrived and took Floyd's pulse at his neck. The paramedic walked away without a sense of urgency before Floyd was loaded onto a stretcher, still unresponsive and handcuffed.
About three minutes after the ambulance arrived, a paramedic in the back of the ambulance took Floyd's pulse and instructed Lane, who was on board, to begin CPR as Lane explained what happened.
Floyd was pronounced dead at HCMC at 9:25 p.m.
Joseph Malinao, 25, a former EMT who has local police officer friends, watched the videos because he wanted an objective look at what transpired.
The videos were difficult to watch, he said, adding that he came away feeling that Chauvin was the only one who should face charges. However, Malinao was struck by how quickly the situation escalated.
"It's baffling to pull the gun that quick over a forgery charge," he said of Lane's initial contact with Floyd. "That set the tone for the whole interaction."

Full text: In a fascinating online discussion (find the video at tinyurl.com/ycd6mu7m), four top Twin Cities chefs -- Gavin Kaysen, Ann Kim, Jamie Malone and Justin Sutherland -- shared their fears and hopes for their businesses, the Twin Cities dining scene and their industry. Here's a summary (edited for brevity) of some of their primary talking points.
On running a restaurant during the pandemic
Justin Sutherland: It has been a crazy busy last few months. A constant pivot, reinventing every day, trying to figure out how we navigate this world that's new every day.
We closed some restaurants, relocated the Handsome Hog [in St. Paul] in order to build an outdoor space and go from 66 seats to 300 seats so we can properly distance.
Our biggest effort was doing a lot of community and charity efforts, trying to keep as much of our staff employed [as possible].
Jamie Malone: We started at Grand Cafe [in Minneapolis] with takeaway food, and it started to become clear to me that if we increased our business in that way we would have to increase the people in our space. That would have meant cramming too many of our staff members together, when so much
was unknown.
Essentially we decided to make meal kits that we could create with just our core people on the team, with staggered shifts, and keeping people spaced out. We also wanted to focus on keeping the group together.
Working in restaurants is a very challenging job, but we receive so much gratification from other parts of what we do: making people happy, making things beautiful. So we really wanted to focus on making things that fulfilled ourselves.
Gavin Kaysen: Bellecour [in Wayzata] has only been open for a week, so I don't have a ton of data. In the summertime we would normally do 300 to 400 people on a Saturday night. Now we're doing 100 to 120. That won't fly for long.
I'm asking myself, "Does the brand stay open to stay open?" I don't have a great answer just because I don't have enough data yet, but in the next three weeks I will have that data to really understand what sort of pivots we need to take.
What happens when it's cold? What do we do when we can't sit outside anymore? That changes the game for everybody.
Ann Kim: I feel a little crazy for even saying that I'm opening up a new restaurant [Sooki & Mimi in Minneapolis] in the middle of a global pandemic. To be honest, a couple weeks into the closure of restaurants we did think about walking away from it.
There are lots of challenges in this profession, but then to try and do it in the middle of a pandemic, when every day is uncertain and unknown -- you try to accommodate everyone. People are looking to you for answers, and deep inside, you don't have any. Your guess is as good as anybody else's.
Yes, we thought about it, but we realized the missings that would come from walking away from it were far greater than actually forging ahead. I decided to put on my big girl pants and just say, "We're going to do this. We're going to make this happen."
Instead of feeling sorry for myself and scared, I decided to look at this as an opportunity for some great change, and to look at this as a new restaurant not in a middle of a pandemic but in a new renaissance for restaurants.
We're really exploring how we can lean into these challenges in uncertain times to really create something beautiful, joyous, special and surprising, because that's why I got into it and I don't want to lose touch with that. This industry is too dang hard to not have that at the end. I'm in the business of making people happy and to bring some joy and beauty into people's lives, and I'm committed to doing that with the new restaurant and the existing restaurants. I'm not going to quit yet. But I've been tempted. Many times.
Looking to the future
Sutherland on the restaurant industry's racial and gender diversity: I think the gender inequality and race inequality in restaurant staffing has been prevalent for forever, and it's just been very unspoken.
I think COVID compounded the George Floyd incidents. Then George Floyd kind of compounded COVID. It all just kind of exploded into this social unrest that things needed to change on many levels, from the way restaurants were run, from our business plans, to our hiring practices, to discrimination in gender, sexual orientation and race.
We get to choose how we deal with it and what our new role is going to be in the new beginnings. I think we're all taking it very seriously and trying to be as active and vocal as we can, whether it's making changes in our own restaurants, to being out there marching on the street.
Whatever your role is, I think everybody realizes the restaurant industry is a very big part of it. We are a social gathering place, and that place needs to be equal for everybody.
Malone on a flat service fee instead of tipping: It's been something that has needed to happen for a long time and this really nudges it along and gives us an opportunity to have fresh conversations with guests about why we are making these changes. We're able to be vulnerable with our guests and say, "Yeah, our businesses are really teetering -- and it wasn't exactly great before, either."
[The service charge] evens out the disparities among our staff. As business owners, [it] just gives us a little bit more control of being able to run our business in a sustainable way.
Kaysen on the industry's next generation: The consumer is not 100 percent safe and ready to go out to eat. I respect that, but I can't tell my landlords that.
Restaurants won't ever look the same again, they will never look the way they looked on March 15th.
We're realizing that our generation now has a responsibility, more than anything else, to change the way that we have been able to do business, to make it better for the future generation.
We might not necessarily see what that looks like, but that's going to have to be OK. We're still going to have to make the sacrifice to do it and to do it right and to make sure that it lives, frankly, beyond any of our restaurants.
Help for restaurants
Kaysen on assistance for the hospitality industry: They [the federal government] have not done enough. Period. They have failed tremendously, and they continue to fail on a daily basis.
At the end of the day, there's really no way that restaurants will be saved unless the federal government steps in and helps us out. At saverestaurants.com is an amazing report that basically breaks down what a stimulus fund would mean for restaurants. One in four jobs lost were in the restaurant and hospitality industries, and those jobs are not coming back.
This is not us going out and saying, "Put money into our hands because we need it." It's pure survival. We will not be around. The restaurant community as you know it will be gone. Everything about the vibrant hospitality scene will literally be wiped away in less than 10 months if that doesn't happen. It's not an exaggeration. I'm not trying to scare people. It's just an extinction that will happen.
Sutherland on the need for a federal stimulus: Remember how many other industries are so closely tied into the restaurant industry. The supply chain that is attached to it is insane -- from farming to trucking -- there are so many jobs that are reliant on restaurants to survive. If we go away, a lot is going to fall down with it.
Kim on supporting your favorite restaurants: One thing that humans are capable of right now is to be compassionate. Please, I know we're all scared, but if you are making judgments before you really have full understanding of what we're going through, it's just the adage that your grandma told you: Think before you speak.
If people are making statements, or reacting toward business decisions that we're making, I try and flip it around and say, "Their fear must be greater than mine," and mine is really great right now. I try to respond with compassion, and I ask the same from our guests.
Kaysen on gift cards: The gift card idea is a really great idea, but it's also sort of a deferment of bankruptcy. All of that money is going into the bank accounts at that time, but when we actually need it is when we don't want you to necessarily use it.
That was a tough message for any restaurateur to get a hold of and say, "Slow down, don't buy $5,000 worth of gift cards right now, buy $5,000 worth of takeout food." Let's do the transaction today, and be done with it versus in the future.
The emotional side
Kim on managing fear: In March we thought, "OK, I can deal with a couple of weeks, maybe I can deal with a couple of months." Now we're at four months, and there is really no end in sight.
We're trying to manage fear because everybody is so scared. I'm scared. Being a leader and being strong, the only time I can break down is in the corner of my bedroom, and crying on the shoulder of my business partner and husband, and he understands.
A mentor of mine asked, "Ann, how much of your day, in percentages, is ruled by fear, and what percentage is ruled by love?" And I said, "90 percent fear, and 10 percent love."
That's a horrible place to be, because when you live and work in fear, you limit yourself to possibility. I didn't come into this business 10 years ago, having never been in it, by saying, "Oh, yeah, the possibilities are 10 percent." I came into it thinking, "The possibilities are 110 percent. I can do anything."
So I'm really trying hard to change that percentage around, to make decisions based in love and possibility and not fear.
Malone on adapting to uncertainty: In the same way that we all wake up not knowing, our guests are feeling the same. Every day is emotionally different.
You have different data about how you want to decide to live your life. There's no way for us to anticipate what the demand is, so you can't decide, "Does staying closed give me a slower burn rate of the money I have left in the bank?" or "Do I have a lower burn rate if stay open?"
If you're open and have to close and then reopen and close, there's a point where you can't keep doing that. You also can't do that to your staff. You can't give them that up and down and back and forth.
Sutherland on vulnerability: It's been ingrained in our industry to always project success, to always make people think that our restaurants are doing great or we were doing great personally, when a lot of times that wasn't the case. That comes from competitiveness and the built-in egos that come with the industry.
[The pandemic] has allowed us to be more vulnerable, to be open and honest, to ask for help and say, "We're all kind of screwed right now." But in all of us being screwed, it allows us to all come together, and realize that we're all experiencing the same thing, and it gives us the opportunity to -- hopefully together -- build something better.
The vulnerability, it's been refreshing to see that, to be like, "Oh, I'm not the only one who has cried myself to sleep because I don't know if I'm going to open my restaurant tomorrow."
Self-care
Kim on how she starts her day: One thing that my husband and I started every morning is a ritual of just starting the day with positivity.
Usually we'd start off the day with the paper -- the Star Tribune, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times -- but it was all the same regurgitated bad news in a different way.
We just said, "We can't do this anymore. We have to start with the positive." So each of us says five things that we're really grateful for, and then we meditate together. That's actually helped quite a bit.
Sutherland on reducing stress: We've all been so deeply rooted in our careers and our restaurants, which we all still are; we love them. But it's been a good opportunity to realize there's more -- and there has always been more -- and just reconnecting with the things around me that are important. Taking walks, going to the gym, taking vitamins, allowing yourself some room to breathe and just taking a little pressure off yourself. Because none of this we can control, and everybody is going through it together. So it allows you to take a deep breath, and roll with the punches, while trying to do better.

Floyd family sues city, officers: Suit claims they used lethal force improperly and that MPD fosters a "warrior-style" culture.

Full text: Attorneys for the family of George Floyd sued the city of Minneapolis and the four officers involved in his death Wednesday, vowing to send a message that the police training and practices that target Black people and led to his killing must no longer be tolerated in the United States.
"This is a teachable moment for America," said attorney Ben Crump, standing outside the U.S. Courthouse in downtown Minneapolis.
While not specifying how much the family will seek in compensation, Crump said, "This is an unprecedented case, and with this lawsuit we seek to set a precedent that makes it financially prohibitive for police to wrongfully kill marginalized people -- especially Black people -- in the future."
Crump said that how the city leaders react to the demands put forth by the Floyd family lawyers will have consequences. "Their political legacy will be defined by how they respond," he said.
City Attorney Erik Nilsson said in a statement that "George Floyd's death is a tragedy.
The city is reviewing the lawsuit filed by his family and will be responding to it. Criminal charges are pending against four Minneapolis police officers, and it's very important that the criminal case proceed without interference."
A spokesman for the Police Officers' Federation of Minneapolis said the union is declining to comment about the suit.
Floyd died May 25 after officer Derek Chauvin pinned his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly 8 minutes as Floyd, who was handcuffed, cried out that he couldn't breathe and bystanders pleaded with Chauvin to stop.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other officers at the scene -- Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng -- are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter. All have been fired.
The federal suit accuses the officers of a "reckless disregard" for Floyd's civil rights.
"This complaint shows what we have said all along, that Mr. Floyd died because the weight of the entire Minneapolis Police Department was on his neck," Crump said in a statement. "The city of Minneapolis has a history of policies, procedures and deliberate indifference that violates the rights of arrestees, particularly Black men, and highlights the need for officer training and discipline."
The suit contends that the officers used deadly force in non-deadly circumstances.
It also alleges that the department engaged in a culture of "warrior-style" or "killology" training, failed to terminate dangerous officers and fostered a culture of racism, leading to a violation of Floyd's civil rights.
In April 2019, Mayor Jacob Frey announced he was banning officers from receiving "fear-based" training. In defiance of the mayor, the police union quickly countered that it was partnering with a national police organization to offer free "warrior-style" training.
On Tuesday, the Police Department said it is changing its use-of-force policy to encourage officers to de-escalate tense situations and hold them accountable when force or weapons are used. Officers will now be required to document how they tried to de-escalate situations, why they decided to use force and why they chose a specific level of force.
The suit lists other litigation over allegations of police brutality by Minneapolis officers, and cites the 2010 death of David Smith, who was killed by two Minneapolis police officers at the downtown YMCA when they subdued him by placing a knee on his back for more than 4 minutes. That death was ruled a homicide by the Medical Examiner's Office, and his family settled the case for $3 million. Jeff Storms, one of the Minneapolis attorneys in that case, is now one of the lawyers representing the Floyd family.
"The Floyd family deserves justice for the inhumane way in which officers with the Minneapolis Police Department killed Mr. Floyd," said attorney L. Chris Stewart, who is also working on the case. "The city has a responsibility to acknowledge the history and practices of excessive force and impunity with its police force, as well as shortfalls in officer training and discipline."
Said Stewart: "He was literally tortured to death."
'Turn a blind eye'
The 40-page lawsuit recounts how officers Lane and Kueng were dispatched to Cup Foods at 38th and Chicago at 8 p.m. on May 25 in response to a call that Floyd had engaged in potential fraud, "a nonviolent offense," for allegedly trying to pass a phony $20 bill.
The suit say Floyd was unarmed and did not resist, yet was handcuffed. Chauvin and Kueng arrived and after Floyd said he was claustrophobic when they tried to put him in a squad car, Lane suggested that the other officers put him in a "maximal restraint technique," placing him face down on the street with the left side of his face pressed against the pavement.
Lane and Kueng knelt on Floyd's back and legs and twisted his arms to the side of his body while "Chauvin drove his left knee in the back of Mr. Floyd's neck."
Floyd begged the officers to stop, saying, "Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead," and repeatedly groaning, "I can't breathe," the suit said. The officers held him in the position even as onlookers said Floyd was bleeding from the nose and begged the officers to get off him.
Lane suggested to the other officers that Floyd be rolled onto his side, stating, "I am worried about excited delirium or whatever." Chauvin responded, "That's why we have him on his stomach," which the suit alleges was contrary to national law enforcement best practices. "No officer attempted to move from Mr. Floyd's body or roll him onto his side," the suit says.
When an onlooker approached officer Thao and urged him to check Floyd's pulse, Thao responded, "Don't do drugs, guys."
The suit said that when another onlooker identified as a health care professional with the city's health department asked officers to check Floyd's pulse, Thao told her to "get on the sidewalk."
The suit alleges that the Minneapolis Police Department trained officers that a "neck restraint" was an authorized form of non-deadly force and that a "chokehold" was a form of deadly force capable of causing serious bodily injury and/or death. The department trained officers that a proper neck restraint required the officer to "[c]ompress veins, arteries, nerves & muscles of the neck," although adding that serious bodily injury or death can result, the suit said.
The suit also says that since 2012, neck restraints and holds were used by Minneapolis police officers on 428 people, 14% of whom lost consciousness. Training materials offered to officers in 2014, including Chauvin and Thao, depict an officer placing a knee on the neck of an arrestee who is handcuffed in a prone position, the suit said.
It said the department failed to provide officers with proper policy guidance and training on how to observe and attend to the medical needs of arrestees subjected to neck restraints.
The suit contends that it has long been known that people placed in a prone position should be on their side as soon as they are secure, but "as of 2012, officers were not provided official training on the dangers of positional or mechanical asphyxia associated with prone restraint" despite the "well-known risk of death."
The suit singles out police union President Bob Kroll, who it alleges had a "white power" logo on a jacket, encouraged officers to "behave aggressively" and has high influence in the department yet has not been disciplined or fired. Kroll has previously denied that he wore such a logo. The suit also said that Chauvin and Thao had enough complaints on their record that they should have been fired before Floyd's death.
The suit also said the department "tolerated, permitted, failed to correct, promoted or ratified a number of customs, patterns or practices that condoned and required officers to turn a blind eye to and not intervene with the use of excessive force by MPD officers."
Similar suits rarely go to trial
Suits against police officers over wrongful death rarely go to trial in Minnesota as city officials worry that a jury could award even more money than a settlement. Payouts involving police encounters have varied widely in recent years in Minneapolis and a nearby suburb; some have been huge.
In 2019, the excessive-force lawsuit by the family of the Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who was white, was settled for $20 million, the largest in the city's history. An unarmed Damond was shot in the alley behind her southwest Minneapolis home by the now-imprisoned officer, Mohamed Noor.
Also last year, the family of Jamar Clark, a young Black man who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police in 2015, reached a $200,000 settlement with the city. It came months after the City Council rejected a previous offer as too low.
The mother of Philando Castile, a Black motorist killed by a St. Anthony police officer in 2016, has reached a nearly $3 million settlement with the city that employed the former officer, Jeronimo Yanez, who was acquitted of manslaughter.

Full text: Attorneys representing two former Minneapolis police officers charged with killing George Floyd accused Attorney General Keith Ellison of contempt of court: One asked him to be sanctioned and the other called for his arrest.
Earl Gray, who is representing Thomas Lane, and Robert Paule, who is representing Tou Thao, filed separate motions Tuesday objecting to Ellison issuing a news release Monday about the case after Judge Peter Cahill issued a gag order prohibiting either side from discussing such matters.
Ellison announced Monday that he had appointed four veteran attorneys as special assistant attorneys general on the Floyd case and listed their professional accomplishments.
"Ellison should be jailed along with" his spokesman John Stiles, Gray wrote. "There is no reason to announce that these so called 'super stars' are joining the prosecution and that they're doing it for free. It is an obvious statement to the public that these 'super stars' believe that our clients are guilty."
Tensions between the prosecution and defense have been escalating for more than a month as Ellison and several public officials spoke out about the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died May 25 after former officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly 8 minutes while Floyd said he couldn't breathe.
"We have no response," Ellison's office said in a written statement Tuesday.
Paule and Gray asked to be heard about the issue at a yet-to-be determined hearing.
"Defendant ... respectfully moves the Court for an order holding Keith Ellison … in contempt of court and ordering sanctions as a result of his actions," read Paule's motion.
The judge is unlikely to sanction or have Ellison and Stiles arrested, said Joseph Daly, professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. He'll likely issue a warning or clarify his gag order, Daly added.
"Judges do not like to sanction lawyers unless their conduct is outrageous," he said. "This gag order is unclear."
Ellison's office is leading the prosecution of Chauvin, Thao, Lane and former officer J. Alexander Kueng with assistance from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.
Ellison sent out his news release Monday after some of the defense attorneys filed motions earlier that day objecting to the order and protesting prior remarks made by Ellison and other public officials.
"Out of respect for Judge Cahill's gag order, I will say simply that I've put together an exceptional team with experience and expertise across many disciplines," Ellison said in the news release.
In his motion, Gray said Ellison's move was intentional.
"Further proof that the news release was done to influence the public is that it was released by John Stiles, who, according to Google, is a chief strategy officer and builds reputations and brands," Gray's motion said.
Cahill issued his order last week prohibiting attorneys from publicly divulging "opinions, strategies, plans or potential evidence."
All four former officers' attorneys filed motions Monday objecting to the order.
Their separate motions argued that the order violated constitutional rights to due process, free speech and a fair trial, and that it unfairly penalized the defense after prosecutors and public officials had spent weeks criticizing the former officers' actions.
Cahill warned at a June hearing that remarks from public officials, attorneys and others were threatening to prompt the court to move the trial or trials to another county because of the possibility of biasing potential jurors.
Chauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree murder, third-degree manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter. The other three are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Floyd family, planned to hold a news conference Wednesday morning in front of the federal courthouse in Minneapolis to announce a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis and the officers involved. Details of the lawsuit were not disclosed.

Most want cop funding cuts now: It's the first Minneapolis public hearing on budget revisions this year since George Floyd's killing.

Full text: Dozens of people on Tuesday night asked Minneapolis' elected officials to cut more money from the city's Police Department, as they readjust this year's budget for the first major time since George Floyd was killed.
The majority of speakers who called in to the City Council's budget committee hearing asked the city to cut $45 million from the Police Department's $193 million budget.
"I don't know why we would continue to fund the Police Department the way we have, as they continue to murder our Black and brown brothers and sisters," said Hunta Williams, a member of the city's Transgender Equity Council. Williams added later: "We're watching. We have our eyes on you."
Reclaim the Block and the Black Visions Collective encouraged people to advocate for the $45 million cut. Lex Horan, with Reclaim the Block, said they reviewed the department's budget to identify areas that "are not directly linked to community safety," such as the mounted patrol, an activities league and special operations and intelligence. They are also calling for a roughly 30% cut in the precinct and patrol budgets.
One of the only people who didn't advocate for cuts was the leader of a downtown business organization.
"Tonight, I would urge you not to make sudden and significant changes to the mayor's recommended and revised MPD budget until and unless concrete alternatives … have been established," said Steve Cramer, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council.
The public hearing Tuesday set the tone for a series of budget talks as city leaders work first to revise this year's budget and then to approve next year's.
Minneapolis leaders hope by the end of July to cut $156 million from this year's $1.6 billion budget as they grapple with revenue losses because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mayor Jacob Frey has said he hopes to save larger questions about the future of policing for the 2021 budget process, which kicks off next month.
Earlier this year, city officials approved the first phase of budget cuts, which the city estimates would save $58 million by freezing most hiring, putting a temporary hold on wage increases and making cuts from city contracts. That total includes $8.6 million in cuts from the Police Department, according to the city.
Last week, Frey offered a proposal that would plug the remaining $98 million hole by relying on cash reserves, implementing furloughs for some employees and laying off up to 40 workers.
The mayor's proposal also relies on a series of budgetary transfers. It includes, for example, a $6 million "rollback" for some housing programs, but also seeks to add $4 million from a housing board established in the 1980s.
The mayor's office said it is trying to keep intact programs that provide "immediate service to residents with greatest needs" and programs that allow the city to qualify for additional funding.
This second phase of cuts, as proposed by the mayor, calls for a $50,000 reduction in the Police Department, specifically from its timekeeping and employee-management system, and the system that tracks transactions in pawnshops and secondhand stores.
Many of the people who spoke Tuesday focused on that $50,000 figure as they asked for greater cuts and instead more investments in housing.
Many of them asked City Council members to fulfill a pledge nine of them made in Powderhorn Park last month, when they promised to work toward ending the Police Department.
The city's next public hearing on the budget is July 22.

Vacant Kmart could be a temporary post office

Full text: Minneapolis officials on Tuesday will consider leasing the vacant Kmart store on Lake Street to the U.S. Postal Service for use as a temporary post office.
Two post offices near Lake Street were destroyed in the unrest following the death of George Floyd. The post office owns the property at 110 E. 31st St., on which it plans to rebuild, and will renew a lease at 3033 S. 27th Av. once that site is reconstructed, according to a city memo.
The Postal Service needs a temporary location during the 12 to 24 months it will take to rebuild, the memo said. A mobile truck has been deployed in the Kmart parking lot at 10 W. Lake St. over the past month to help fill the void for south Minneapolis customers.
The Kmart was already scheduled to shutter by June 30 after the city bought out its lease, but the riots following the May 25 police killing of George Floyd accelerated its closure.
The lease agreement with the city calls for the Postal Service to pay $30,416 a month in rent beginning Aug. 1. The city-owned property has been eyed for redevelopment, but the memo states the temporary arrangement won't affect those plans.
The Postal Service needs a loading dock and about 184 parking spaces for employees, delivery vehicles and customers. Costs to prepare the site will be covered by the Postal Service, but the city will pay for outdoor property maintenance, such as snow removal, and for maintaining building systems. These costs will be capped at $365,000 annually.
The City Council's Business, Inspections & Zoning Committee will consider the matter on Tuesday. Postal Service officials were not immediately available for comment Monday.

Veterans make push for special courts: They want law for venue to keep vets out of prison.

Full text: When Tony Miller returned to Minnesota in 2008 after two tours in Iraq, the Army veteran wasn't right. Military buddies were dying by suicide. He didn't like how his antipsychotic medications made him feel, so he smoked marijuana instead. He was filled with anger, and he vented that anger as a bouncer at a Twin Cities hockey pub. When a bar patron acted out, Miller could beat him up.
It was 2015 when Miller was arrested on drug charges. His attorney helped get him into veterans court, a new concept in Hennepin County that helped give veterans a second chance. Instead of prison, the alternative court instituted another plan. Miller had to stay sober and keep regular therapy appointments at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System, where he worked through his traumatic experiences in Iraq. Five years later, Miller, 37 and living in Bloomington, is about to start at the University of St. Thomas to get his master's social work. After graduation, he wants to do counseling work at the VA.
Now Miller's anger is directed at state politicians. For two years in a row, legislation to expand veterans courts throughout greater Minnesota has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. In a last-ditch effort to get it passed this year, veterans organizations are increasing pressure on legislators to pass a bill during this week's special session.
The partisan politics that has stalled the bill is "a slap in the face to veterans," Miller said. "I pray that this will pass." But he also realizes "coronavirus is completely overshadowing every other issue we have."
Gov. Tim Walz called this week's special session to extend the COVID-19 peacetime emergency order by 30 days, and he has urged the Legislature to pass a "robust" capital investment package as well as police reform and assistance for businesses hurt by civil unrest following George Floyd's death in May.
Veterans advocates frame the bill as fitting into this moment, since it is both an alternative form of criminal justice and a cost-saver as COVID-19 has ravaged state finances.
The Veterans Restorative Justice Act hasn't made it out of committee in the Senate during the past two legislative sessions, despite legislators on both sides claiming to support the bill that would keep veterans who have committed lower-level criminal offenses out of prison.
The fiscal note attached to the legislation says that had the bill been enacted at the end of the 2019 session, the state would already have saved $422,000 by lower incarceration costs, and $1.3 million by June 2021.
"It costs the state's taxpayers money every day this bill does not pass," said Tommy Johnson, a veterans advocate with the VFW Post in Hopkins.
Parties differ on why the bill has yet to pass.
Republicans say it's a simple question of the Legislature being overwhelmed with COVID-19 concerns. Republican Sen. Roger Chamberlain, R-Lino Lakes, a military veteran, who says he supports the bill, believes it would have passed this session if it weren't for COVID-19 and George Floyd's killing. This week's limited, narrow special session is not the time for a bill like this, he said.
"That's not what this special session is going to be," said Chamberlain, who added he will support the bill in 2021. "There's always next year."
But DFL politicians claim partisan politics is preventing a bipartisan bill supported by national veterans organizations from immediately passing.
"In the 10 years I've been in the Legislature, this was the worst session for political partisanship I've ever seen," said Sen. Jerry Newton, DFL-Coon Rapids, the ranking minority member of the Veterans and Military Affairs Finance and Policy Committee. "But generally with issues regarding veterans, that doesn't happen."
This version of the bill would be limited to veterans with service-related disorders facing low-level felony charges (no more severe than a level 7 criminal offense), and only if the defendant claims the offense was connected to military service. In 2019, 6% of offenders incarcerated in a Minnesota correctional facility self-reported that they were veterans.
For Jeff Johnson, a 70-year-old retired Army major from Shoreview, every day the Legislature waits is a mistake.
Johnson credits the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office and the veterans court for saving his life. Johnson had been bedridden and sick for six years -- back and balance issues, nerve surgeries, stress -- when in 2017 he called 911, intending to commit "suicide by cop." Instead, deputies shot him with nonlethal beanbags. Veterans court directed him to an inpatient treatment program at the St. Cloud VA Health Care System. He now feels better than any time in his adult life.
"This bill has been up twice," Johnson said. "It's been a political football enough."

Media seek video footage in Floyd case: It can be viewed only by appointment at the courthouse, not recorded.

Full text: A coalition of local and national media companies, including the Star Tribune, filed a motion Monday chastising the court for withholding two body-camera videos recorded by police officers the night George Floyd was killed, and called for their immediate release.
Attorney Earl Gray filed two body-worn camera (BWC) videos in court about a week ago as evidence supporting his motion to dismiss the charges against his client, Thomas Lane, making it public data, according to state law.
The court's insistence that the videos be viewed by appointment only in the Hennepin County Government Center downtown violates state laws governing public records, court rules and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the motion argued.
"The Media Coalition requests that the Court … immediately make the BWC [body-worn camera] footage available for copying by the press and public so that it may be widely viewed not just by those who have the time and wherewithal to visit the courthouse during a global pandemic but by all members of the public concerned about the administration of justice in one of the most important, and most-watched cases, this State -- perhaps this country -- has ever seen," said the motion written by attorneys Leita Walker and Emmy Parsons.
The media coalition also includes American Public Media, which owns Minnesota Public Radio; the Associated Press; CBS Broadcasting Inc.; Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal; Hubbard Broadcasting, which owns KSTP-TV; and the New York Times Co., among others.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over the cases against four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's death, is making the videos viewable from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Wednesday.
"Attendees must store their electronic devices while in the room, and no video or audio recording will be allowed," said the court website.
The footage was recorded by Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, rookies whose attorneys have argued that they were deferring to officer Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran, as they pressed on Floyd while he lay handcuffed, stomach-down in the street complaining he couldn't breathe.
The videos' release would lend more context and accuracy to transcripts of the videos released last week that contradicted each other, according to the coalition's motion.
"Reporting is hamstrung by the inadequacy of the transcripts …" the motion said. "… The transcripts appear to have obvious errors."
The court has not identified "extraordinary circumstances" to limit the videos' release, and the court is compelled by rules to hold a public hearing before taking such action, the motion said.
"There is no reason to believe that making the BWC footage itself easily accessible to the press and public would materially impact the fairness of trial," the motion said. "… As days of unrest in the Twin Cities showed, it is vitally important that the public have full confidence in the process and outcome of this criminal prosecution."
The coalition asked to argue its case in court next Tuesday.
Gray has also said the public should see the videos so people don't "cherry-pick" information about the case. A bystander recorded and publicly broadcast video of Floyd's death, which did not capture Lane or Kueng, who were obscured behind a squad car.
Lane was holding onto Floyd's feet and Kueng was holding onto his back while Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly eight minutes as bystanders pleaded with the officers to stop.
Former officer Tou Thao controlled the bystanders and rebuffed their concerns. The killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, set off days of protests across the world.
Chauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Kueng, Lane and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
The former officers' trial or trials are set for next March.

Police apologize for man's arrest: Black driver had visions of Floyd's death; Richfield video shows cordial stop.

Full text: A Black man said thoughts of George Floyd's fatal police encounter went through his head as he sat in the back of a squad car last week in Bloomington after three white officers pulled him over and approached him briefly with a gun drawn.
Darrius Strong posted a video on Facebook soon after the encounter saying "I could have been dead today" during what began as a traffic stop along Old Shakopee Road. "Just remember … anything can happen to us, man, especially Black bodies … Black people, Black men. … Racial profiling is a thing."
Police released Strong after they realized they had the wrong man, and on Saturday night the Richfield Police Department issued an apology on Facebook saying he was victim of an "unfortunate case of mistaken identity."
On Monday, Richfield police released squad car dashcam footage that showed a cordial encounter for the entire 14-minute stop Friday afternoon between the officers and Strong, who questioned why he was being arrested before police realized their mistake, apologized and let him go.
Strong, 30, of Burnsville, said after watching the police video that he had a faulty recollection "because I had so much fear in me" when he contended in a Facebook video soon after the encounter that all the officers had their guns drawn.
"My mind was so jumbled," he added. "I just wanted people to know how frightened I was."
The discrepancies between Strong's initial account and the dashcam video prompted the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association to caution citizens against mischaracterizing interactions with police.
"There are clear differences between Mr. Strong's earlier Facebook video and both the officer report and [Monday's] released dash camera video," Association Executive Director Brian Peters said in a statement. "Based on the video evidence released, Mr. Strong was treated with respect, and the officers followed all of their trainings and procedures."
Strong's public account of his detention by police comes at a time of intense scrutiny of police encounters, particularly involving Black men. The police killing of Floyd during a routine arrest created weeks of protests and has prompted Minneapolis city officials to look at a dramatic rethinking of the Police Department and the best way to ensure public safety.
Richfield police released squad dashboard camera video Monday in an effort "to promote transparency" about the speeding stop led by one of their officers as part of a state traffic enforcement campaign.
The video showed that Strong was calm, albeit surprised, when told he was wanted for felony check forgery and about to be taken to jail. At the same time, Richfield officer Amanda Johnson and the others remained polite throughout and apologetic once the mistaken identity was cleared up.
"Shoot," Johnson said while reviewing the warrant information as Strong sat behind her. "This might be the wrong guy. ... Yep, exact same name."
Another officer retrieved Strong's identification from the car as he gave police his Social Security number and said he doesn't write checks.
"That guy has a tattoo on his neck," Johnson said in reference to the actual at-large felony suspect.
"So sorry," she said to Strong.
He replied: "I appreciate your kindness."
"You are free to go," she said. "I am sorry. ... Have a better day."
Richfield Police Lt. Brad Drayna said the video showed that "it was a very cordial encounter. It was a very professional traffic stop."
Drayna said that despite the check accurately showing that Strong had a warrant out for his arrest in connection with a 2019 speeding ticket, Johnson chose let him drive off because she "felt sorry for putting him in the back of her squad car." She also didn't cite him for going more than 15 mph over the 35 mph limit, Drayna said.
Strong, a prominent figure in the Twin Cities dance community, is a performer, choreographer and instructor who was awarded a $40,000 Jerome Foundation fellowship last year. The fianc and father of a 1-year-old who lives in Burnsville said in his video that all of the officers approached his car with "their guns out. [I] stuck my hands out the damn car."
However, video showed only Johnson with her gun out and down at her side. She put it back in the holster once she arrived at his driver's window.
Addressing why Johnson had her gun drawn, the Richfield police statement explained that it's justified because of "the high-risk nature of arresting individuals with felony-level warrants."
Once cuffed and in the back of the squad car, Strong's posting continued, "I'm shaking. … I don't know what they gonna do to me when this door closes. … George Floyd came to my head, I ain't gonna lie. He came to my head thinking about … when they put him in the back and they was doing all kinds of things to him."
He said he questioned the officers about why -- as he contended -- they had their guns drawn, and was told he was under arrest and would have his vehicle towed because he was wanted for check forgery. However, the video didn't reveal any question like that from Strong.
"Once again, George Floyd popped into my head," his Facebook posting recounted.
Floyd, unarmed and handcuffed, died while in police detention on May 25 at a south Minneapolis intersection. Police were called there on a store clerk's suspicion that Floyd was trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.
Once confirmed that Strong was not a wanted felon, the tow truck was canceled about 12 minutes after the stop began, according to emergency dispatch audio, and police let him out of the squad car and took off the handcuffs.
"A Black man traveling in these suburban communities ... it could have ended in a whole different route," Strong said in his posting.
The police statement noted that "this was no doubt a stressful and emotional experience for Mr. Strong. While they were doing their jobs based on what they knew at the time of the traffic stop, officers regret the stress Mr. Strong felt."
The statement added that all three departments will "make sure Mr. Strong's record is cleared and will continue to have important conversations in our communities regarding police-citizen encounters and how they need to reflect the best of all involved."

Full text: Until recently, Iglan Ahmed hadn't seriously considered moving from the 2900 block of S. 18th Avenue.
But when a 12-year-old boy shoved a handgun in her face during a robbery attempt outside her south Minneapolis home, the mother of eight decided that she'd had enough.
"I'm scared for my life," Ahmed said of the troubled block just north of Lake Street, which she says has turned into a haven for drug dealing and prostitution. "If no one is doing anything, there's no way for me to live in this neighborhood."
Ahmed and her neighbors say the block has become even less of a priority for police and City Hall after the unrest that followed George Floyd's death in police custody, leading to calls to reimagine policing in the city. They say it's one reason the area stands out as the city's most notorious open-air drug market. And while some sympathize with the long-term goals of the "Defund MPD" movement, they say they're facing a number of other issues that require more immediate attention.
Like the surrounding East Phillips neighborhood -- which is 84% people of color -- the block is home to many working-class families from Latin America and East Africa.
Drugs, gangs and prostitution have long been prevalent, and last month the area was battered by rioting and looting that spread through the South Side after Floyd died. Located in the Third Precinct, East Phillips also saw violent crime jump about 16% in the decade between 2010 and 2019.
Ahmed and others say the block feels isolated from E. Lake Street, the area's main commercial drag. But it's far from quiet, with dealers openly peddling bags of marijuana and heroin in the middle of the street, day and night. Vehicles pull up like customers at a drive-through, with drug users sometimes getting high in front yards and porches. The stench of urine is overpowering in some places. And employees of a nearby day-care center start each day by sweeping their playground for used syringes and condoms that may have been dumped there the night before.
"Before everything with George Floyd, we had been calling the police and asking for their help, but unfortunately the only thing that the Police Department was willing to do or able to do was just driving down the block to say, 'You've gotta keep moving,' " said Jeremy Gray, a block captain.
Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said police are aware of the ongoing crime and have added patrols and been in contact with neighbors.
"The MPD has long supported neighborhood watch and neighborhood watch patrols for those who wish to do it," he said.
In an e-mail to residents, Kali Pliego, a crime prevention specialist for the Third Precinct, said she was "sincerely concerned" after visiting the block recently and promised to station a mobile police camera nearby when one came available.
"Status quo is not serving your families justice," Pliego wrote. "I want to help, but am not in the position to be able to offer more police resources at the moment. 911 calls will be answered, but temporarily, we cannot count on directed patrols or other proactive measures."
What sometimes gets lost in the post-Floyd conversation around policing is that communities blighted by poverty and neglect are also often deprived of "effective policing," said criminologist Rod Brunson.
"It's not an either-or: It's the combination of under- and over-policing that occurs simultaneously that undermines police effectiveness and police legitimacy," said Brunson, a professor at Northeastern University's school of criminology and criminal justice, noting that "extreme calls for abolishing police altogether" would prove "dire" for people in high-crime areas.
On the day of the attempted robbery, Ahmed said she was sitting in her car behind her house and glanced up to find two youngsters armed with handguns. They demanded she hand over her car keys and wallet. One of the youths stuck a gun in her face as he tried to grab Ahmed's phone, letting off a shot in the air that startled her. Ahmed wasn't injured, but she says the episode left her shaken.
Council Member Alondra Cano, who represents the area, said that she is "equally unsatisfied with the current system" of policing that has alienated residents while failing to put a dent in the area's problems. For years, she says, the department's focus was on cracking down on low-level offenses like public urination while allowing more serious crimes to flourish. Cano, who has supported dismantling the Police Department, says a harm-reduction approach is needed to address the area's problems.
"It's been really frustrating for me in that MPD hasn't been able to deliver results on that front," she said.
But neighbors said that Cano has been equally unresponsive to their pleas for help, and that calls to her office often go unreturned.
Minneapolis may yet serve as a national model for a new approach to public safety, but not if it doesn't first "protect its most vulnerable citizens," according to Sarah Lageson, an assistant professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University-Newark.
Like her neighbors, Devika Ghai sees the block's problems as a symptom of general neglect by city leaders, but she isn't convinced that more police are the answer. After Floyd's death, she said, much of the country woke up to the reality that its "Black and brown" citizens have long known: a public safety system that has touted justice for all but rarely delivered.
"There just isn't any political will to address any fundamental issues here, which is people don't have housing, people don't have dignified employment and people are criminalized over and over again, so people end up in criminalized industries," Ghai said. "I think the problem is that there've been so few alternatives for so long."
After months of frustration, some residents have banded together to take back the block. They set up private WhatsApp groups to share photos and videos of illegal activity and later began round-the-clock monitoring while wearing yellow T-shirts that read "Neighborhood Watch" on the front and "Security" on the back. Some started carrying guns. Then in the past few days, they blocked off both ends of the street with metal barriers and garbage bins filled with concrete to cut down on speeders who used to fly down the block.
Since then, neighbors say they've enjoyed their first stretch of quiet nights in months, but some doubt the uneasy calm can last long without help from police or Cano.
Residents say that some police officers have shown an interest in their plight, like the sergeant who helped defuse a tense standoff Wednesday between locals and a city worker, who showed up to remove the fencing. The sergeant eventually negotiated an agreement that allowed residents to keep the barriers up, so long as they could guarantee a path for ambulances and other emergency vehicles.
Abdi Hassan, who works for the state Pollution Control Agency, says things got so bad that some neighbors were afraid to use their front doors out of fear of being harassed by dealers, who seem emboldened by the lack of police presence. A few weeks ago, Hassan said he decided to move his wife and two young kids into his mother's house in the south suburbs.
"We told them about the encampment and the drugs and the vacant house," said Hassan, adding that he's left numerous messages with Cano about an abandoned house on the block that seems to attract trouble, to no avail. "Cops don't help, nobody helps -- we don't know where to go."

MOTHERS MARCH IN ST. PAUL FOR JUSTICE

Full text: George Floyd called out for his mother 10 times during his encounter with Minneapolis police and as he struggled to breathe while officers pinned him to the ground.
On Sunday, moms from across the country took Floyd's pleas as a call to action and marched to the State Capitol in St. Paul, demanding justice for loved ones and accountability from police.
"It means a lot to me and my family to stand with other families to demand that they reopen all cases, because you see that there's a lot of corruption going on," said Greta Willis, who flew in from Baltimore in honor of her 14-year-old son, Kevin Cooper, who was shot and killed by police in front of her in her home on Aug. 12, 2006.
The National Mothers March Against Police Violence brought together more than 100 families in the U.S. who have lost a loved one to law enforcement officers, said organizers with Take a Knee Nation.
Mothers and widows united in that loss and the fight for justice sat in a truck flatbed leading a crowd of 1,000 protesters down St. Paul's University Avenue to the Capitol. Over megaphones and speakers, chants of "Love your …!" were followed with "Mother!" as well as calls to prosecute the police involved in the deaths.
Philando Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, was dancing as she marched toward the Capitol, where she thanked the crowd for supporting the movement and all the mothers.
"This is what my community looks like. We are a community and we support all the families that are here," she said wearing a "Justice for Philando" face mask while flanked by families from Georgia, Florida, Colorado, New York, Ohio, Missouri, California and Maryland.
Willis said her teenage son was having an emotional breakdown when he was shot by an officer who was promoted and remains on the force today.
"There needs to be accountability," she said. "If this didn't happen to George Floyd, we wouldn't be at this point because the world could see the officer on his neck. In Kevin's case, we had no camera. But they didn't take my word, they took the officer's."
Maria E. Rosario-Rivera, the mother of 30-year-old Brian Quinones, was not at Sunday's march, but she was there in spirit while other members of her family helped organize the event.
Quinones was fatally shot by Richfield and Edina police officers last September. In February, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office said deadly force was justified and none of the officers involved would face charges.
Sobbing over the phone from her home in Puerto Rico, Rosario-Rivera said Quinones was her firstborn child. It hurt to see her son's name included in a long list of other victims of police violence at the Floyd memorial on 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis. She visited the site and was invited along with other family members to Floyd's funeral. She recently left Minnesota because she said her "heart can't hold it no more," but plans to return for the anniversary of her son's death.
"It's really hard for me to understand why the police do that to my son. That destroys me. I don't know what's going on in this world," she said. "From my heart, I got a feeling that things will change, but change takes time. It is sad that this has to happen. Nobody deserves to leave this world that way. God bless all the mothers being in these situations."
Her 13-year-old grandson, Cameron, reminds her of his late father, and she's proud of daughter-in-law Ashley Quinones' continuing fight for justice -- most recently with a wrongful-death lawsuit. Ashley Quinones, founder of the Justice Squad, was one of several organizers of Sunday's march, along with Minnesota Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, 10K Foundation, Black Lives Matter Chicago and Communities United Against Police Brutality.
The protest was one of many across the Twin Cities over the weekend, six weeks after Floyd died. Gun violence this summer has plagued Minneapolis, where 224 people have been shot in 2020, including 33 homicides. Last year, 269 people were shot in the city. The spike prompted the "Guns Down, Love Up" rally Friday. Organizers of the Mothers March held a retreat Saturday for families affected by police violence.
Activists are planning a march in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 28 outside the Department of Justice to demand officials reopen cases involving police violence.
On Sunday, Ashley Williams held her 8-year-old son's hand as she marched. She said while she's been attending many protests the past month, this was the first one where she brought her son along.
"I'm out as much as possible marching every chance I get until changes are made that benefit us and that treat us Black people the same way that white people are treated in America," she said.
She said so many families were part of the Mothers March, and they only represent a fraction of those who lost a loved one to police violence. "If they're killing your family members, you can't trust them. There's no trust," she said.
"There should be no reason you have to march week after week after week after week letting people know our lives matter," she said.

ECHOES OF THE STRIFE OF 1967: FIFTY-THREE YEARS LATER, THE UNREST IN NORTH MINNEAPOLIS RESONATES IN A NEW WAY.

Author: Evans, Marissa

Full text: As the world watched the civil rights uprising in Minneapolis after George Floyd's death, some in the city were not surprised that it happened here. They had seen it before.
In July 1967, people angered by suspected police brutality took to the street on Plymouth Avenue, then one of the city's commercial strips. Three nights of arson and destruction drew hundreds of National Guard troops and added Minneapolis to the list of cities in the mid-1960s rocked by protests.
In the eyes of two activists of that era, Minnesota is still in denial about its own issues with systemic racism.
Lifelong civil rights advocate Josie Johnson was an adviser to the mayor at the time, and hopes that the city's pain in 2020 will lead to real change.
"It was a hurtful moment to see this man murdered and yet I felt that perhaps his sacrifice would enlighten the world as to how our Black men can be treated without any worry on the part of the authority," Johnson said. "I had the feeling that perhaps George Floyd's life had a historical and lasting help in the world seeing how Black men in America can be treated."
The state's unwillingness to confront racism and inequities is why "Minnesota is the Mississippi of the north," said Spike Moss, who, helped co-found The Way, a Black community center on Plymouth Avenue, in 1966.
"It's never just the incident that sparks it," Moss said. "The fuse is always there, we just need you to light it. We go to bed and we wake up in the same hell."
The spark on July 19, 1967, was the rough handling by Minneapolis police of two Black girls who were fighting over a wig, the Star Tribune reported at the time.
"The police were not gentle, but you can't be in separating two women," police Inspector Donald Dwyer said then.
Police said Black youths set fires and threw rocks at law enforcement and shop windows of north Minneapolis businesses, most of them Jewish-owned at the time. Thirteen Black people were arrested after the first night of disturbances.
Black people were protesting in the street over more than just their grievances of police violence but lack of access to jobs, housing and other injustices based on the color of their skin, Johnson said.
During the 1967 protests, Johnson was an adviser to Mayor Arthur Naftalin and was urging him to understand why the Black community was rebelling.
She said Naftalin had a "deeper sense" than other mayors seeing disruption in their cities at that time on why there was anger and unrest in the Black community, even if Minneapolis wasn't perceived as having the same problems with race as Detroit or Newark, N.J.
"We were viewed as a different collection of people, and we too in Minnesota are having serious racial and equality issues and therefore there was a need to pay attention to that," Johnson said.
"We too needed to say that Black people in Minnesota are upset and angry and felt that denial of justice and equality too and we could identify what our brothers and sisters in other parts of the U.S. felt."
Moss said part of the reason Minnesota's problems on racism and discrimination were not more widely known at the time was because of the lack of local media coverage -- including the Star Tribune's predecessors -- and suppression of stories about how Black people and Native Americans were being discriminated against and brutalized.
He said The Way was unfairly blamed in the media for stoking trouble. It became harder for the center to secure funding after that.
After Floyd's death in May, he felt as if "finally" there was tangible evidence of the brutality the Black community had long spoken of and no one could deny it.
Rose Brewer, a professor of African American and African studies at the University of Minnesota, pointed out that while the 1967 uprising and the Floyd protests happened in different political and social moments, there's "certainly continuity" in what the Black community is fighting for.
Another difference is that Minnesota's inequalities were exposed during the Floyd protests in a way that had more reach than the 1967 protests. There was a "convergence of crises" with the coronavirus pandemic, people losing jobs, lack of access to health care and more, Brewer said.
"You have a whole period of instability and the fact that that police narrative has always been embedded in what catalyzes the Black community to respond," Brewer said. "It's just been so consistent over so long of a period of time I would say it should not be surprising to folks to make that connection between an earlier period that did catalyze a lot of what we are confronting today."
For Johnson, Floyd's death shows "the struggle is probably more evident" for how hard it's been to not only seek justice but force Minnesotans to see how the police can treat Black people.
As horrified as she is by what happened to Floyd, she is heartened that this time feels different.
"Everything dealing with humans and policies has a time that finally is understood, is seen, is heard and it's when those times come that people are able to respond," Johnson said. "Minnesota's time finally came when people could actually associate the disadvantaged inequality and abuse of our people everywhere and acknowledge that, yes, we too need to be conscious of that and work on it."

As gun violence continues, Mpls. marchers plead for peace

Full text: Pleading for an end to the gun violence that has ravaged their city this spring and summer, marchers walked through the heart of north Minneapolis Friday evening, calling on residents to put their "guns down" and their "love up."
A few dozen community members gathered for remarks and prayer outside Shiloh International Temple Ministries before heading east on W. Broadway, stopping along the way to mourn and to honor victims of gun violence.
It wasn't the first such gathering since George Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody unleashed a sea of unrest, followed by a wave of gun violence. And it certainly wasn't the largest.
But it might have been one of the most urgent, taking place just hours after Minneapolis' 32nd homicide of 2020. That's double what the number was at this time last year.
All told, 224 people have been shot in Minneapolis this year, according to police data. In all of 2019, the city had 269 gunshot victims.
"Father, you know exactly why we're here," North Side resident Korey Dean said as he and a group of Black pastors led the mostly masked group in prayer under the beating sun. "The gun violence has to stop. … The guns must be put down and the love must arise."
The violent stream continued unabated Thursday into Friday, with yet another person killed and eight others injured in shootings across the city. Among those wounded were a pregnant woman and a 17-year-old boy who was struck in the leg three times, officials said.
In the most recent homicide, a man in his mid-20s was gunned down early Fri
day near Farview Park, in the 2900 block of N. 6th Street.
A woman was critically wounded in that shooting. She was taken to HCMC, where she went into surgery for critical injuries. Officials said they were told that she was pregnant. Her condition was unknown Friday night.
The double shooting in a residential neighborhood was a grimly familiar scene, and the second shooting involving a pregnant woman in less than a week.
In the other incident, 27-year-old Leneesha Columbus was fatally shot near the south Minneapolis street corner where Floyd was killed, and a man serving as a security guard at the memorial site was also hit, but survived.
Police said that doctors delivered the baby at an area hospital before Columbus died. A 27-year-old man, the father of the baby, has been charged in her death.
Chuck Robinson, a 60-year-old North Side resident who lives in the Folwell neighborhood, has been on the scene of six shootings in recent weeks -- including one where a 7-year-old boy was shot in the foot.
At Friday's march, Robinson expressed a range of emotions as he grappled to understand and explain what's driving the surge in gun violence.
"There's a high range of anger," Robinson said, referring to reaction to the police killing of Floyd as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has put many people out of work. "We have to come together. We can't police ourselves out of this problem."
The Rev. DeWayne Davis, a North Side resident and pastor at All God's Children Metropolitan Community Church, said the violence is a culmination of long societal neglect of minority communities and lost confidence in law enforcement.
Solving this complex problem will require all Minneapolis residents to band together against it, not just those on the North Side, he said.
It will also require Minneapolis police to be a "constructive partner" in addressing gun violence, not one that treats residents as "enemy combatants," Davis said.
"No one has the luxury, especially after what we've seen since George Floyd's killing … to say this is not about me," he said.
Outside Shiloh Temple, community leaders warmly welcomed Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria "Rondo" Arradondo and urged residents to engage with him.
Arradondo told the group of marchers that police alone will not quell community harm and violence. The problem will only be solved with "the hard work of all of us coming together," he said.
The current spate of violence is "unacceptable," Arradondo said. There are a lot of guns on the streets, he said, and police are finding more gunshot rounds at scenes than they did in previous years.
Some of the violence is associated with gangs, "but we've also seen a lot that has not been," he said.
Some at the gathering questioned whether police have scaled back their response amid the debate over the department's future and backlash against police. Arradondo said that isn't the case.
The surge in gun violence has drained the department's resources and affected response times, he said.
Most who marched Friday agreed that police reforms are needed. But few were open to the idea of eliminating police officers' role in public safety.
Davis, the pastor, said leaders need to rethink whether the first responder to a mental health crisis or school discipline problem should be an armed officer. Bringing in mental health and social workers will help free up police to focus on problems like gun violence, he said.
"I think we really do need to have a serious conversation about what our law enforcement is for, and who it is for," Davis said.
Activist and civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong sought to highlight the need for police reform, economic investment and job creation, saying those measures will help address the root causes of gun violence.
Many young men in the community have lost hope and turned to violence as an outlet, she said.
"What we have to do is come together, and we have to give our young people a reason to live and not die," she said.
FEMA denies post-riot aid
On Friday, Minnesota learned that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had denied its requests for disaster aid to clean up after the riots that followed Floyd's death.
Gov. Tim Walz had requested aid to help rebuild and repair structures in Minneapolis and St. Paul that were damaged by rioters, looters and vandals. Federal funds would have been used to reimburse local governments.

Full text: Whee!
On a sunny afternoon, a group of dizzy people collapse on the ground after running around in circles while screaming at the top of their lungs. They lie on their backs looking at the sky before rising to do the exercise all over again, running counterclockwise and collapsing in glee.
This activity has been happening nearly every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon on the western edge of Minneapolis' Powderhorn Park since mid-March. If it all looks like child's play -- where, but at an amusement park or a horror show, do adults have license to scream with such abandon in public? -- it's because it's meant to be fun. But it also has serious purpose.
"It's for physical and psychological relief and release," said Harry Waters Jr., a theater artist and Macalester College professor who started and hosts this unique combination of laughing yoga and theater exercises. "We live in strange times with the pandemic and the uprising against systemic racism. People are stuck in front of Zoom or feel they don't have an outlet. This is something that's needed."
That "something" is Outside Voices, an activity that offers an outlet in a time of worries and troubles. The communal screaming at the sun is the culmination of a ritual process that can last 10 to 15 minutes. It involves an introduction of everyone in the circle, the telling of gibberish jokes and lots of laughter. In fact, laughter is a through-line for most of the activities, including the sharing of some dire, even tragic things.
In some cultures, people write down things that ail or terrify them and then burn the pieces of paper. In Powderhorn Park, they laugh at such things.
The 10 or so people who gathered in the circle on a recent Saturday gave voice to a series of distressing personal news -- a single person said she feared dying alone, another threw out that she has no way to make a living in August, and a third shared news that a relative was back on meth.
After each of those depressing shares, the circle erupted in hearty laughter.
"I feel so relieved, especially by the laughing at tragedies," Laura Esping, an actor, said. "There's something so powerful about expelling all this macabre stuff. It's goofy fun and absolutely cathartic, especially doing it en masse."
Esping knew about Outside Voices because Waters is a friend. But Chika Okafor, who did not know anyone in the circle, was just walking with a friend in her favorite park before heeding Waters' invitation to join.
"I feel like transformative is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but let's go ahead and use it," Okafor said. "It's such good energy. You get to stand with people, which we haven't done much of. And given everything that's happening, this is a moment to commune with other people and to take a pin to the balloon of whatever pressure is building inside of you."
Socially distant loudness
Outside Voices began organically.
After the coronavirus pandemic forced a shutdown of schools, theaters and cultural life in mid-March, Waters, 67, who originated the role of Belize in Tony Kushner's landmark drama "Angels in America" and who played the "Teen Angel" singer alongside Michael J. Fox in "Back to the Future," was walking in the park after being cooped up at home. He saw a friend, Katie Burgess, across the lake.
"We just started screaming at each other," said Burgess, an actor and co-founder of Open Flame Theatre. "Harry laughs loud and I'm loud, and we just had this joy and excitement."
The two friends, who had worked in the same experimental, edge-pushing theater environment, decided to meet in the park so that they could commune and be loud while being properly socially distant. They let others know about their reunions, and they also were open to anyone passing by. Pretty soon the word was out, especially in the performing arts community.
Esther Ouray, a performer and certified laughter yoga teacher, showed up early on and contributed an exercise to the ritual. It was to tell a joke in gibberish, using the cadence of stand-up but in a totally made-up language.
"That way no one is offended," Ouray said. "Then we laugh our tails off."
On a recent Saturday, Waters' joke had a staccato cadence resolved in naughtiness: rata ta rata ta-tah, pada pa-ra-da-dah, pooh.
"We're laughing not because of the words in the jokes itself but because of the kind of ridiculousness of the situation," said Sonja Kuftinec, a theater professor at the University of Minnesota. "And even if the laughter starts out fake, it becomes real because it does something to your body to change your mood."
Although it has attracted performers, Outside Voices is not theater. At least, not exactly.
"True, it's not telling stories or using dramatic persona but it's doing some of the things that are theater-adjacent without having the stories or impersonation that we think about conventional theater," Kuftinec said. "All you do is take a moment of natural connection, put a little ritual and structure to it, and that's performance."
Expanding scope
Although started as an antidote to COVID-19, Outside Voices has been extended to offer a kind of healing ministry in the post-George Floyd era. In fact, the park is just eight blocks from where officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck.
The sessions took on a different tone, starting with one held just two days after Floyd's death.
"Everybody was still in shock," Waters said. "There were seven of us there who were just present with each other. We didn't have to solve anything, just recharge, release and get back out there, whether to march or to Zoom."
It's also relevant that the sessions take place in Powderhorn Park, which now has hundreds of tents sheltering residents, many of them left homeless by the unrest that followed Floyd's death. The fact that Waters leads Outside Voices and is a Black man is literally and metaphorically apt, intimated Kuftinec, who has taken her grade school-age son to the circle several times.
"This is not just about Black lives but Black liberation and Black joy," Kuftinec said. "It shows the importance of Black bodies in public spaces laughing and living. It's important for Black bodies to be out here experiencing and expressing joy and calling out to people, saying, 'I'm inviting you into this circle, and you don't have to fear this Black stranger.' "
For his part, Waters loves the mix of different elements of the ritual, including theater and yoga.
"If people use yoga to get in touch with their inner core, this is something for relief, release and recharge," he said. "Everybody's holding tight right now. It's 20 minutes of your life that allows you to be outside and let go. And you have permission to say hello to people just walking by."

Lawmakers at odds, still hope for police reforms

Full text: Minnesota state lawmakers will get another chance at passing police accountability measures into law next week, with Gov. Tim Walz planning to call a special legislative session for the second time this summer.
Walz said Tuesday he is optimistic that lawmakers can strike a deal on both a public works spending package and on police reforms in the wake of the May death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
But the politics remain tricky. A few hours after Walz revealed his plan to call a special session this coming Monday, members of the Legislature's People of Color and Indigenous Caucus -- joined at a statehouse news conference by Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar -- said that GOP legislative leaders have not been communicating with them about police accountability proposals.
"Until we get that meaningful dialogue, I'm not sure how we can get things done," said Sen. Jeff Hayden, DFL-Minneapolis.
A special session last month ended in acrimony as Democrats who control the House and the Republican-led Senate hit an impasse over a series of measures meant to increase police accountability in response to Floyd's killing.
"The Senate GOP supports police reforms like banning chokeholds and de-escalation training. However, we won't support any DFL 'reforms' that defund or dismantle the police," Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, tweeted on Tuesday in response to the DFL claims.
House Democrats continue to push for a sweeping package of changes to boost community-led alternatives to policing, ban warrior-style training for officers and raise the threshold for using deadly force from "apparent" to "imminent" threats to officers and others.
As noted by Gazelka, Republicans supported a handful of those measures, including raising training standards and requiring officers to intervene if colleagues use excessive force. But Democrats said they didn't go far enough.
Democrats have repeatedly insisted their package does not defund or dismantle police departments. But Gazelka said a DFL proposal to spend $15 million on policing alternatives could be an opening to take the state in the direction of defunding.
Senators have focused on "lawlessness events and governmental responses" in a series of informational hearings. They have discussions scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday on Capitol security and the state's role in responding to riots that damaged many businesses.
People of Color and Indigenous (POCI) Caucus members said Tuesday that Republicans are valuing damaged property over people's lives. Omar, who was one of the founders of the POCI Caucus when she was a state legislator, said action is needed at both the state and federal levels. She criticized President Donald Trump and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not acting on a criminal justice and police accountability measure passed by the U.S. House.
"I guess the president would rather attack the people who are protesting than actually address the issues that people are out here protesting for. And as my colleagues here will tell you, we are seeing the same here in Minnesota," Omar said.
At the State Capitol, a special session is automatic if Walz extends his emergency peacetime powers for another 30 days. He said he intends to do that next week. Walz has been employing those powers to manage the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
"It's pretty evident that we will be going into a special session, probably next Monday," Walz said Tuesday.
The other major legislation still subject to negotiations between Democrats and Republicans is the borrowing package for public construction projects, called the bonding bill. Lawmakers from both parties agree it would bring the state a needed economic boost but at the same time have been tying its passage to the fate of other legislative priorities.
Hayden and Rep. Rena Moran, DFL-St. Paul, both said Tuesday they would support a bonding bill only if police reforms passed. And House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, has said he wants an end to Walz's emergency powers to be part of a bonding deal.
"Obviously we can't walk away without doing some police reforms in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, and we also have bonding that is part of the economy that is going to be really important, and some supplemental issues that need to be addressed," Walz said. "I think for Minnesotans, they see a hyperpartisan environment, I can tell you this: the legislative session is working, there is a commitment to try and get it done."
Republican Sen. Dave Senjem said he's spent six days in private negotiations trying to reconcile separate bonding bills previously passed by the House and Senate. Lawmakers are debating the final pieces, which include housing and transportation funds in a package that will likely hit $1.35 billion, he said.
"I'm feeling that we're getting close, and we'll be able to close up the 5 percent of this bill soon and I anticipate having it ready to go next week," Senjem said. "At this point, there's no reason to think that there won't be a bonding bill."

A PLACE OF PRAYER FOR THE CITY

Full text: Every morning this month, a quiet ritual unfolds inside a large white tent in the parking lot of a north Minneapolis strip mall marked by boarded-up businesses.
As cars roar by, volunteers lay out nine pretty rugs under the tent's roof, placing a prayer pillow, folding chair or kneeler on each. They set bouquets of flowers at a small table up front and next to the entrance sign announcing "Prayer Tent."
"Silent Prayer. For 8 Minutes, 46 Seconds. Stand, sit or kneel," reads the sign, which has guided a stream of visitors to the new project called 30 Days of Silent Prayer: Healing the Heart of Our City.
"The goal is the healing of the multiple layers of trauma our communities have experienced and preparing ourselves to create a different future,'' said Don Samuels, former Minneapolis City Council member and ordained minister, who launched the project July 1 with his wife, Sondra Samuels.
The tent offers people a sanctuary to get in touch with their grief over the COVID-19 pandemic, the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, the destruction of local businesses and longstanding community issues, he said.
It adds a spiritual component to the array of protests and policies being debated to address community traumas.
"This is a shared public ritual where people of all faiths can come together," he added.
The prayer tent is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily, hosted by North Side faith organizations that lead the silent prayers and collaborate on the projects.
As they explain to their guests, the 8 minute, 46 second prayer period reflects the amount of time a Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on George Floyd's neck before he died.
Jamia Muriziq, 14, was among a group of students from Liberty Community Church's 21st Century Academy who stopped by to pray shortly before noon Tuesday. Wearing an "I can't breathe" COVID-19 protection mask, she said she was grateful for the experience.
"I haven't had time to be alone with my thoughts," said Jamia, leaving the tent. "A lot of people my age don't have time to think things through. I kind of reflected about stress. And I prayed for a lot of things."
Tuesday was Day 7 for the project. The first prayer was introduced by an elder from Liberty Community Church, one of many African-American churches on the North Side that are collaborating on the project.
On the physically distanced rugs inside sat several Liberty church leaders, project volunteers and people who'd driven from as far as St. Paul and Eden Prairie. While most sat with heads bowed in silent prayer, one man held Buddhist prayer beads and another sat cross-legged in a yoga position.
At 8 minutes, 46 seconds, the elder tapped a singing bowl that chimed, signaling the end of the prayer. Some people opened their eyes. All remained quiet.
"You are welcome to stay longer," Samuels told the group. "And we'd like you to record your thoughts."
Samuels gestured to another tent just steps away, where a videographer was recording guests' experiences and posting them on social media and their Facebook page.
The Rev. Alika Galloway, co-pastor at Liberty Community Church, stood up after the silent prayer. She called the prayer tent an "opportunity to transform grief into positive energy."
"It's a clarion call, a call of unity," said Galloway. "A call of grieving collectively. Even when we're down, we pick each other up."
Julie Stevens said she drove from St. Paul to visit the prayer site, which she learned about from a friend. She said she wanted "to feel the pain that is in this geography, to feel the sense of place." She also was seeking divine inspiration over her role in making things better.
"You're praying for something that hasn't come to you yet," she said.
Kathleen Olsen came from the Seward neighborhood of Minneapolis, where she's a church musician associated with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet. She serves on the sisters' committee focused on confronting racism and has come daily.
"When I'm done praying, I take a walk around the neighborhood," Olsen said. "I'm trying to get out of my white, liberal, progressive bubble. I want these prayers to seed something new in me."
Davontre Snoddy, a junior at Patrick Henry High School, has been staffing the videography equipment at the site. He said it's been a moving experience.
"Everyone is grieving for something," he said. "The lives lost. The looting. The stores burning down. And George Floyd. They ask, 'Why did it have to be like that?' "
The 30 Days of Prayer continues through July 30.

Women musicians pitch a 'safe space': Launched via a $5 million GoFundMe campaign, Auntie's will be owned by women of color.

Full text: After dozens of women spoke up with stories of abuse and harassment in the Twin Cities music scene via social media two weeks ago, three prominent local musicians have kicked off a fundraiser campaign to open a safe-haven music venue operated by women of color.
With no set location yet but a firm name in mind -- Auntie's -- hip-hop and R&B stars Sophia Eris, Lady Midnight and DJ Keezy announced their intentions last week along with an ambitious $5 million GoFundMe campaign to get the venue up and running.
"With the recent uprising ignited from the murder of George Floyd combined with accusations of abuse in the music community, the need for a safe space is evident and urgent," the power trio wrote at the start of their GoFundMe mission statement.
"Auntie's will be a venue owned by womxn of color rooted in radical freedom of expression without judgment. Leading with loving accountability, it will provide a safe space that presents performance, fosters healing and provides professional knowledge. Highlighting powerful femininity, Auntie's welcomes people of any age, race, gender or sexual orientation to leave our
space feeling empowered, inspired and supported."
Response has been swift and in some cases rapturous, with $37,000 raised in the first 24 hours and a widespread show of support from the Twin Cities music scene and beyond.
"You all are being the change we need," ex-MPR producer Jeyca Maldonado posted with her donation.
"We can't imagine better people to be leaders in the Twin Cities," Justin "Bon Iver" Vernon tweeted.
The three women behind Auntie's have diverse musical backgrounds and amount to a wide range of experience.
Sophia Eris spent most of 2019 on tour with Lizzo while also releasing singles under her own name and serving as an on-air host at Go 95.3 FM.
Keezy recently toured as Atmosphere's opener and is the chief organizer of the Klituation dance parties, which have packed First Ave and other spaces with all-female or gender-fluid performers.
And the ethereally voiced Lady Midnight has been performing all over town -- from Icehouse to the Turf Club -- after dropping her acclaimed album "Death Before Mourning" last year and guesting on a wide variety of other artists' tracks, including at least one male artist beset with allegations.
While they listed a wide variety of idealistic plans to set their dream venue apart -- they even pledged to enlist mental health and sex abuse experts as advisers -- many logistical questions remain, including the size, shape and location of the place and a targeted opening date.
This would not be the first Twin Cities music venue operated by women minorities, as their post claims. Arnellia's in St. Paul and El Nuevo Rodeo in Minneapolis were owned and run for decades by women of color, but each is now closed (the latter destroyed by arsonists in the E. Lake Street riots after George Floyd's tragic death).
Of course, any timetable for opening hinges on the ongoing pandemic and limited-capacity issues plaguing music spaces around the world.
For now, though, it's nice to at least have Auntie's as a goal to aim for once live music can rise again -- and to help ensure not everything will return to normal in the Twin Cities scene.

Full text: Semhar Solomon was 12 years old when she went to her first protest. It was four years ago, shortly after Philando Castile was killed in Falcon Heights. That political moment hit her hard. An officer from the Police Department in St. Anthony, where Solomon had lived her entire life as an African-American in a majority white community, had fired five shots into Castile's body.
On a steamy afternoon four years later, Solomon, now 16 and a rising senior at St. Anthony Village High School, stood on that same street outside that same police department. Spurred by the outpouring of rage and5 activism in the aftermath of George Floyd's death at the knee of a Minneapolis police officer in May, she had organized Monday's protest to commemorate the four years since Castile's death on July 6, 2016.
The street was blocked off. Vendors sold buttons to support the foundation started in Castile's name. Volunteers registered new voters. When an activist shouted, "Say his name!" the crowd reacted with confusion: Half of them shouted "George Floyd!" while the other half shouted "Philando Castile!"
That was exactly the point.
But to Solomon, Monday's rally -- indeed, all the protests in the aftermath of Floyd's death -- felt very different from her first protest four years ago.
Because this time, the crowd chanting, "Black lives matter!" was mostly white.
"Now I have people behind me, after George Floyd got murdered, and it's not just a Black and people of color community standing behind me," she said as 300 people watched a Mexica Aztec dance troupe perform. "So I feel like my voice is actually amplified more, and that I'm not yelling into a wall. Because four years ago, the community members that spoke up against the police department in St. Anthony were silenced."
Six weeks after Floyd's death outside of Cup Foods in Minneapolis, Monday's protest in St. Anthony -- as well as another protest outside the governor's residence in St. Paul -- underscored that the movement that started with protests and riots in the Twin Cities then spread across the nation continues to have momentum.
And Solomon's words about the color of these protests rang true: Black Lives Matter's national approval rating increased more in the two weeks after Floyd's killing than it had in the previous two years, according to Civiqs, an online research firm.
Like the memorial at the intersection of 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis where Floyd was killed, Monday's event had a dual purpose: a memorial for a 32-year-old man and a call to action.
Valerie Castile, Philando's mother, took the microphone from Solomon and told her family's heartbreaking story: That Philando had been stopped by police "75 to 80 times" in his 13 years of driving, which she said indicated institutional racism. That he followed all the rules when the St. Anthony police officer pulled over his vehicle. And that he was still killed.
"He was murdered right here in this area, this nice, little area here where all the white folks say they got the best police department in the city," Castile told the crowd. " 'Our police department is the best in the city!' I say, 'For who? For who?' You don't have to worry about driving down Larpenteur after it gets dark.
"That man shot my baby five times," she continued. "Not once, not twice -- he shot him five times. While he was seat-belted in his car. Can you, just for a moment, think about how Philando felt, starting down the barrel of a gun? Them bullets just ricocheted off every bone, every organ, just tore his body up inside.
"And 12 civilized people said that was OK. That was OK."
Earlier on Monday, Valerie Castile stood beside John Harrington, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, and announced updates to the state driver's manual to give motorists legally carrying firearms -- as her son was when he was killed -- more guidance on what to do if they are stopped by police.
Simultaneously, a Black Lives Matter protest of about 80 people gathered at the governor's residence.
There stood Diamond Reynolds, Castile's fiance who was in the car when he was shot. Reynolds said she and her 8-year-old daughter, who was also in the car, have been diagnosed with PTSD. Her daughter still has nightmares, and she either gets scared or sticks her tongue out when she sees a police officer.
"Just because you are not affected by what's going on doesn't mean that your kids won't be affected," Reynolds said. "Four years from now I just hope that police will be more held accountable and that the people will come together more to stand for justice. That is when we'll know whether a change has been made."
There also stood Allysza Castile, Philando's sister. She held her daughter -- almost 2, named Philandra after her uncle -- and talked about the baby she is carrying. Neither of her kids would ever meet their uncle.
"Twenty years from now I don't want to be protesting with my daughter and my son. This time it feels different, the reaction that George got," she said, referring to the aftermath of his death.
"But it's been suppressed emotions from all these years. There's been so many people," she said, listing off Terrance Franklin, Jamar Clark, Philando Castile and Justine Ruszczyk Damond. "It was just like throwing fuel on the fire and you guys wondering why the city is in flames.
"As a regular human, if it wasn't your family, you're going to go on with your life the next day," she continued. "But you can't keep living if it's someone in your life who has been taken away from you. Because your life isn't ever going to be the same again."
After Castile's shooting four years ago, protests continued for a while, but had nowhere near the national scope of the protests spurred by Floyd's death. The officer who shot him, Jeronimo Yanez, was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter. At St. Anthony Village High School and throughout her city, Solomon could feel the status quo return to her community.
Last year, she went on an eye-opening civil rights tour of the South through the ARTS-Us Center for the African Diaspora. But everyday life still felt it had returned to the status quo. Among her friends, she felt like the "token Black person." She wanted her white friends to feel comfortable around her. She stayed quiet about race.
After Floyd's death, though, her silence felt like complicity. So did the silence of her community. She didn't want that. Not when, just four years ago, something similar happened in their own suburban backyards.
"So many people turned away," she said. "Because they could. Because they had the privilege to, seeing as how St. Anthony is majority white. Now I'm hoping that after George Floyd got murdered, that can get people actually speaking and talking. Because the suburbs aren't innocent, you know?"
That's what Monday's protest was: a way to commemorate a life taken too soon, and a way for Solomon and people like her to force St. Anthony -- to force white people -- out of their comfort zones. She has lost friends who have objected to her vocal activism, and because she was now willing to call them out for their silence. But she has been heartened by how this time, more white people seem to be taking these issues more seriously.
"I don't just see it anymore and let it sit with me, and make myself uncomfortable, and stay silent to make them comfortable," she said. "Now I speak up against it. It's not just Black people that have my back and are speaking up. We got strength in numbers now. There's people that are willing to stand up against racial injustice, and I don't have to force them."

Transit workers call for policy, policing reforms: They object to how the agency serves minorities.

Author: Moore, Janet

Full text: Some employees at Metro Transit are demanding widespread changes in the way the agency serves minority communities in the Twin Cities.
Spurred by the death of George Floyd and its aftermath, about 200 past and present employees of the Metropolitan Council, which operates Metro Transit, signed the June 26 letter outlining the changes they seek.
They question how decisions are made at the regional planning body, especially those affecting people of color, and call for changes in the way public transportation is policed.
Metro Transit riders and operators "are disproportionately impacted by the trauma of George Floyd's death," according to the letter, which notes that a quarter of the system's passengers and half its bus drivers are Black.
The site of Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police, 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, and the subsequent unrest occurred along two of Metro Transit's busiest bus routes in south Minneapolis, prompting the employees to write that "our riders are leading the uprising and demand change."
The letter was addressed to Met Council Chair Charlie Zelle, Regional Administrator Meredith Vadis and Metro Transit General Manager Wes Kooistra.
Met Council leaders declined to publicly comment on the letter Monday, saying they preferred to confer with the employees first.
"This was a very thoughtful letter that raises important issues and questions, it deserves an equally thoughtful response," spokesman John Schadl said in an e-mail.
Several changes were suggested for the Metro Transit Police Department, which is under review by the council. Details about the departmental review have not been publicly disclosed.
Employees called for "appropriate resources for public safety," including the deployment of transit ambassadors to help with fare enforcement, "an activity that doesn't require force."
The idea of putting unarmed ambassadors on buses and trains failed to gain traction this year at the Legislature, which was increasingly focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.
Those who signed the letter favor diverting resources from the Metro Transit police budget to community-based programs that provide emergency medical and social work services to transit passengers experiencing homelessness or mental health crises.
The letter calls for the Met Council to be better prepared for future demonstrations, including developing a plan to continue operations during periods of unrest. During the recent Floyd protests, Metro Transit shut down service for about a week, leaving many regular customers stranded.
The letter notes the Met Council also should revise contracts that permit its vehicles to transport law enforcement officers, military personnel or protesters who have been arrested -- similar to pacts struck in cities such as Seattle, Boston and Philadelphia.
The writers call for more transparency regarding Metro Transit police activity, including a public reporting mechanism that would document the use of force, response times to calls and complaints and investigations involving officers.
The letter also questions the way feedback from staffers and the community is handled by Met Council leaders "who then have exclusive authority to decide which ideas they are comfortable pursuing." Internal reviews and "introspection" have resulted in "no meaningful or longstanding results," the letter states.

COMFORTING IN A CRISIS: CHAPLAINS FAN OUT AT PROTESTS, FOOD LINES, FESTS FOR THOSE TRAUMATIZED BY GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH

Author: Hopfensperger, Jean

Full text: Kelly Sherman-Conroy felt the anguish on the streets following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, concluding that people were aching for more than food and emergency relief.
So the Lutheran leader and Native American activist posted an appeal on Facebook for "clergy, spiritual leaders and mental health leaders who would like to serve as volunteer chaplains."
More than 100 faith leaders have stepped forward, fanning out at events ranging from State Capitol protests to food distributions to a Juneteenth celebration. They serve as compassionate listeners, helping hands and tension diffusers in stressful situations.
"We're not trying to convert anyone," said Sherman-Conway, minister of social justice and advocacy at Nativity Lutheran Church in St. Anthony. "We're around so that people have someone to talk to, if they want. And that happens a lot."
The group, loosely called Interfaith Volunteer Chaplains, can be seen at community events in bright orange shirts with "Chaplain" printed on the backs and with COVID masks on their faces. Their ranks include a minister who worked at the ruins of the World Trade Center in New York and a chaplain who consoled after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Sherman-Conroy said.
They show up only where invited and arrive with no preset agenda, said Sherman-Conroy. Their work has included handing out slices of donated pizza to the hungry at a church, sitting in the shaded grass with an exhausted woman waiting for groceries, and distributing bottles of water
at protests while being attentive to the well-being of those taking them.
Before they head to the streets, the chaplains must attend online training led by Sherman-Conroy -- essentially a crash course on cultural sensitivity and trauma.
"The whole idea is to send in people trained a bit on how to be around people in trauma, how to be aware of their own actions, who understand the crisis mode of volunteering."
Radar for needs
On Friday afternoon, Sherman-Conroy and several other chaplains headed to the emergency food distribution at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Minneapolis.
She checked in with the other chaplains, then headed to the back of the line of hundreds of people waiting to pick up groceries. She casually made conversation with several, radar up for any unspoken issues.
Colleague Bethany Ringdal, a church planter for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, already was talking with waiting families, keeping the mood positive.
"I have a 1-year-old son, and I spend a lot of time with pregnant ladies in the line," Ringdal explained. "I might ask if they want to sit down. Or if they need something. Or if someone wants me to pray for their baby, I will."
Meanwhile, chaplain Peter Stebinger, a retired Episcopal Church minister, was pushing a pallet stacked with boxes of donated vegetables toward the tents where they would be sorted and handed out.
"We do whatever we're asked to do," explained Sherman-Conroy.
And what they do differs with the assignment. Last Friday, this same group, plus others, were invited to the Juneteenth celebration on Lake Street. They started by handing out water bottles and chatting with folks, but then were asked by organizers to kick off the evening events on stage.
So the entire group climbed up the steps to the stage.
"You'll notice a lot of people here in orange shirts," Sherman-Conroy told the crowd. "We're chaplains. We're here if you just need someone to talk to."
Eric Won, one of the organizers of the Juneteenth event, stood watching with a smile.
"They're just gifts," said Won, of Unite and Rebuild MSP Project, a coalition of community groups that sponsored the Lake Street Juneteenth event. "It's a hard job to work with this trauma and see people through. They're not political. They don't have an agenda. They're simply there to comfort."
New type of chaplain
Being visible in crowds doesn't necessarily mean people rush forward to bare their souls. Most of the time, these chaplains are doing other volunteer work and handing out water as an entree into conversations. People share with them hesitantly or after checking them out, they said. Only then comes the opportunity to help process their trauma.
"We're seeing all stages of grief," said Sherman-Conroy. "Extreme anger. Sadness. I had someone who couldn't quit laughing; it was just nerves.
"It's grief, active grief, that is played out individually and communally," she said. "And it's everywhere."
Stebinger worked with hundreds of trauma victims while volunteering as a chaplain for nine months at the World Trade Center site in 2001 and 2002. He provided emotional support mainly for city employees, such as firefighters and police officers.
"I learned that recovery from a disaster can take months, not days," Stebinger said. "Every single time I work, someone talks to me. It reminds me why I'm here."
Chaplain Anna Mercedes, a theology professor at the College of St. Benedict and St. John's University, said being part of this group has been emotionally rewarding and a learning experience. She recalled volunteering at Holy Trinity shortly after the violent protests scorched Lake Street and getting worried as some people waiting in line started to surge forward.
So she gestured for another chaplain, Holy Trinity deacon David Rojas Martinez, to help.
"He said something like, 'I'm so glad you're here. Thanks for coming. We will work this out,' " Mercedes said, remembering his calm tone of voice. "He said that over and over, like a mantra. … And things started to calm down."
Those are precisely the kinds of skills that Sherman-Conroy hopes the chaplains will bring to their posts as they continue their work in the Twin Cities.
"We want to lead through our actions," she said.

Full text: Influential Black members of the Minnesota arts community have joined together to "illuminate an unabashed and missing narrative" for "a historical moment of transformation" following the death of George Floyd.
A collection of essays titled "A Moment of Silence," the compositions come from a wide cross-section of the area's theatrical, musical, artistic and literary circles. The 55-plus contributors include author Marlon James, rapper Toki Wright, writer/director Carlyle Brown and Star Tribune theater critic Rohan Preston.
The project is edited by performer/playwright Sh¡ Cage and is produced under the auspices of the Playwrights' Center and the arts organization Tru Ruts. It can be accessed at blackmnvoices.com. The featured artists will rotate each month, with a spotlight post made every week.
By ROHAN PRESTON rohan.preston@startribune.com
"Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."
- Frederick Douglass, American abolitionist, writer and philosopher
In the end, the image that would spark a global uprising against systemic injustice and oppression would not be of a stereotypical Bubba in a pickup truck. That was so last week, when three men hunted and savagely killed 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery as he was out for a jog not far from his home in Georgia.
Nor would the spark come from the no-knock drug raid that resulted in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old medical technician who was asleep in her Louisville, Ky., home. That death was one of the many nauseating tragedies that African Americans face across the country.
The searing, catalytic image would come via video from Minnesota, my home and a state that sent activists to the South in the 1960s. That progressive reputation was brought into sharp relief by a picture that shatters myths about good guys and bad guys.
Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who snuffed out the life of George Floyd by pressing his knee on his victim's neck for nearly eight long, excruciating minutes, is a regular-looking guy. We all know him. He's somebody's neighbor and uncle and fishing buddy. He's the middle manager who knows the system well, and that it's designed to protect him; management has got his back.
And in the picture, he's putting on a demonstration of his power, not just for the junior officers around him, but for all to see. Cocky, self-assured and relaxed, he has sunglasses on his forehead and a hand in his pocket. That casual demeanor is not one we associate with a killer, much less a villain. No, Chauvin's mien is that of someone out golfing or boating or, even, trophy hunting. And if he's the person he seems to be, he'll swear on a stack of black bibles that he doesn't harbor any bigotry. He may even claim to have a Black friend. And, the kicker: His wife is Asian American, just like one of the junior officers charged with abetting him.
I cannot bear to watch the entire snuff video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. It's too traumatizing. Nor is the often-viewed video, shot by now-scarred 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, the problem. Cellphones have become tools of evidence to present to a society skeptical of the routine degradations that Black people endure in America.
The disturbing stills of the scene that fateful day in Minneapolis challenge the traditional narratives that dominate the nation's stages and screens.
As viewers, we are trained to look at the officer, who is in the command position, as the good guy. White and in uniform, he is representative of the law. We make presumptions about him based on his office, even if those presumptions diverge along racial lines. Floyd, the dark victim, is faceless and in a subservient position, literally under a knee.
Shorn of context on any screen or stage, the story playing along with the picture suggests white virtue and Black guilt. That's a narrative we know well.
Twin Cities casting director Kelli Foster Warder has likened Chauvin to Willie Conklin, the white fire chief in the musical "Ragtime" who takes umbrage at the sight of a Black man driving his own car and eventually destroys the vehicle.
"Everybody recognizes Willie Conklin as the bad guy because he shouts the N-word," Foster Warder said. "Otherwise, no one who sees him walking down the street would think he's the poster child for racism and white supremacy."
The fact that Chauvin is such a regular guy means that it will be difficult for the mainstream to separate from him. I mean, some talk about the banality of evil. Chauvin embodies white supremacy as ordinary.
We associate heroes with those who're winning and living. But the picture of Floyd forces a reordering. We don't know nearly enough about this father and uncle who became an unwilling martyr in a centuries-long struggle for justice in America. And we cannot let the image of how he died represent his life.
We know that he had survived the COVID-19 pandemic and was making do. He is accused of passing off a fake $20 bill. That's about how much his life was valued in a caste system where the virus of bigotry that was present at the beginning still courses through the nation's DNA.
Those ills have created qualifying asterisks on America's lofty promises. We are a land of liberty (except for Black people, enslaved and brutalized for centuries as they forged a nation). We have equal protection under the law (hmm, cue the nauseating sequence of cellphone videos showing otherwise). Anyone can be anything (lie to kids and they stop respecting adults).
It's apropos that this upwelling, led by young people, should start in Minnesota, and not just because Prince founded the Revolution here, as a popular meme notes. Minnesota has some of the nation's largest racial gaps in housing, education, jobs and incarceration rates. Those statistics belie the "Minnesota miracle" of lore.
Minnesota has been at the forefront of cultural trends and events that have helped humanity advance. Starting more than a century ago during a time of food scarcity, the state began to feed the world through innovations in milling and agriculture, helping the global population grow to what it is today.
Minnesota-led advances in health care, embodied by the Mayo Clinic and many medical device companies, have contributed greatly to the health of the globe. Culturally, the 1963 founding of the Guthrie Theater sparked the regional theater movement across America.
African Americans have been integral members of an area where, in the 19th century, Dred Scott sought freedom and where today the University of Minnesota houses the Givens Collection of African-American Literature, one of the largest resources in the nation.
Renaissance artist Gordon Parks found his voice as a writer and filmmaker in St. Paul, as did dramatist August Wilson, who honed his craft at Penumbra Theatre.
The killing of Floyd comes 99 years after three Black circus workers were lynched in Duluth -- an atrocity memorialized by Bob Dylan in "Desolation Row." Citizens and leaders of Minnesota now have an opportunity to show a nation how to turn tragedy into medicine.
The state cannot just go back to business as usual with shallow window dressing and paeans to racial equity and justice. We must address our worst-in-the-nation disparities, heal the divides and build a more just, equitable and freer society, one where the unrealized promises of American democracy flower in the glimmering light bouncing up from the state's 10,000-plus lakes.
Such an outcome would be a fitting tribute not just to George Floyd, but would help to reframe images that bind us to a past that often imprisons us all.

Full text: Judeah Reynolds watched the police officer grind his knee into George Floyd's neck and hold it there until the man on the ground stopped moving, stopped crying out for his mama, stopped breathing.
Judeah Reynolds is 9 years old.
Too young to walk to the corner store alone.
She coaxed her 17-year-old cousin Darnella into walking with her to Cup Foods as Memorial Day was winding down. She had $3 in her pocket to spend on candy. Jolly Ranchers, maybe. Or Starburst.
Together, they walked to the store, and into history.
At the corner of 38th and Chicago, the kneeling officer locked eyes with Judeah, giving her the same look he leveled at Darnella as she pulled out her phone to record the scene. A look that said, "There's nothing you can do about this. You have no power, little girl."
Until Darnella Frazier posted her video and the whole world could see what the cousins had seen.
The weeks since have been weeks of protest and unrest and promises from politicians. All four of the officers involved in George Floyd's killing are facing charges in connection with his death.
"The person who tells the story has the power," said Lily Coyle, owner of Beaver's Pond Press in St. Paul.
Judeah Reynolds is going to tell her own story. The story of what happened that day she walked to the store, and in the days that followed. The children's book she's writing with the help of the staff of Beaver's Pond is set to publish in early 2021.
"I've got a lot to express in my book. I can't wait," Judeah said, sitting in her publisher's bright, book-lined offices last week.
"A Walk to the Store" -- Judeah came up with the title -- will be a picture book about a little Black girl who witnessed something unspeakable and found her voice.
Judeah explains how scary it was. How hugs from her mom helped her through the nightmares that followed. How she worked up the courage to return to the corner of 38th and Chicago a few days later and found it full of people planting flowers, painting murals and marching for justice for George Floyd.
Judeah painted a protest sign of her own that day and held it high: "It can be better."
We don't need to stop children from finding out what happened to George Floyd.
We need to stop what happened to George Floyd from happening to anyone else's child.
Judeah's not sure how many books she might sell. Maybe 700, maybe a zillion. Maybe, she said, she could sell enough books to afford a home.
Her family is living out of a hotel right now. Minneapolis' problems with equity and racial justice didn't start or end with George Floyd.
But Judeah's mother, Diane Reynolds, has faith. Faith in God and faith in her community.
"In the days I was down on 38th Street, I saw the strength and the diversity and the richness of Minnesota," Reynolds said. "It was all walks of life down there. Different races, different creeds, and we were standing in solidarity. There was no hate."
At Beaver's Pond, Judeah played Barbies and make-believe with another young publishing star, Cameron Brundidge. Cameron's mother, Sheletta Brundidge, wrote a book about Cameron's first day of school -- the first book Judeah had ever seen with a little Black girl, just like her, on the cover.
The families connected, reached out to Beaver's Pond -- publishers of "Cameron Goes to School" -- and soon Cameron was explaining what it's like to be the hero of your own story.
"It's not easy. It's really hard work," Cameron explained last week. "You have to sign [all those books], you have to make the pictures and the words in the book."
But it's worth it, Cameron said, looking over at the shelf where her book is on display: "My book is famous."
It's not surprising that Judeah made it nine years without seeing herself reflected in the stories on her bookshelf. A 2018 survey of children's book illustrations found that half the faces were white, more than a quarter were creatures like animals or aliens or trucks, 10% were Black, and other races showed up in the single digits.
Sheletta Brundidge hopes parents and teachers read Judeah's book to children of all races.
"What little white kid's not going to read this book and say, 'Mama, I don't want this to happen … I want to be an ally. Mama, they're marching, I want to be out there,' " she said. "That's going to have a ripple effect on how children are going to perceive racism."
Judeah knows that telling a story can change history. Just like she knows she'll have many more stories to tell in her life.
After she finishes her first book, she said, "Then I'm going to [write] a part two. I'm going to make a chapter three, chapter four, chapter five, chapter six -- all the way to 11."
This is Judeah's story and she's the hero of this story.
"I'm powerful," Judeah said. "I can't be afraid."
Friends of the family have organized a fundraiser to help them get into more stable housing. You can find out more at tinyurl.com/j-reynolds.

America can do better, say July 4th protesters: Marchers call for racial equity and police overhaul.

Full text: Hundreds of people dressed in black marched mostly in silence through downtown Minneapolis on Saturday night to call for racial justice and an end to police killings of Black Americans.
The march was one of two held Saturday in Minneapolis on the July 4th holiday.
The Black 4th march began at U.S. Bank Stadium and proceeded peacefully around downtown Minneapolis. Some participants knelt occasionally to honor Black victims of police.
The march took the throng down Washington Avenue, and they were expected to cross the Stone Arch Bridge and end up at St. Anthony Main, where they planned an event with food, music and a homegrown fireworks show. As darkness fell, many in the group held sparklers and urged solemn silence in the streets.
Troy Mortenson of St. Paul said he marches for his 9-year-old son. "I can't imagine having him go through something like George Floyd went through," said Mortenson, who is Black. "I'm scared for his future."
Mortenson says he first got involved with social justice causes after the death of his close friend, Philando Castile. "To see him get shot in front of his child, that was it for me," he said, describing the fatal traffic stop whose aftermath was livestreamed on Facebook.
The 10K Foundation, the Justice Squad and Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence organized the march. A sculpture honoring George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody on Memorial Day, and Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot by police in Louisville, Ky., was to be unveiled.
Earlier, at Roll 4 Justice, about 200 people on roller skates, roller blades, bicycles or on foot proceeded from Minneapolis City Hall to a rally at Bde Maka Ska.
They passed through several downtown and Uptown neighborhoods as they called for abolishment of the criminal justice system in favor of investment in social and mental health services.
"The people who live around Bde Maka Ska, they don't know what we've been through or understand what this movement and revolution is about," said Mari Mansfield of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee.
The event was organized by MIRAC, CAIR-Minnesota, LatinoAltROCK, Asamblea de Derechos Civiles and Native Lives Matter.
Lukas Skrove biked from his Golden Valley home for his third protest since the Memorial Day death of George Floyd in police custody. Skrove said he had to educate himself before he felt he could participate.
"I identify myself as a white person who has a long way to go ... cleaning up the mess white people need to clean up," Skrove said.
Jewel Spearman, 19, of north Minneapolis, has protested police treatment of Blacks several times before and after Floyd's death. "Not all people are free right now," she said of the significance of the protest's July 4th timing.
Also Saturday, the Northside Riders 4 Justice, a group of Black gun owners, rallied at the State Capitol in St. Paul against gun violence but for the right to keep and bear arms.

Floyd story got personal for Black journalists

Full text: For many Twin Cities journalists, covering George Floyd's death and the events that followed has been the biggest assignment of their careers. For Black reporters, it's something much more.
News gatherers are conditioned to keep their composure in the field, even when tear gas fills the air or neighborhoods go up in flames. Stay objective, stay cool. But that becomes a bigger test when race is the core issue, when you're related to someone who looks just like George Floyd. When you could be George Floyd.
"I'm trained to keep my opinion out of the interviews I do, but I have 52 years of experience being Black," said Minnesota Public Radio host Angela Davis. "We're witnessing the pain and trauma that Black folks have had to endure for generations. I can't separate myself from that because it's my story, as well."
To help get through the sleepless nights, local reporters of color lean on each other for emotional support. It's a small club, since minorities are underrepresented at major media outlets throughout the Twin Cities.
Six Black journalists recently opened up about the struggles they have faced the past few weeks, revealing the challenges they normally only share with each other.

'Food is how we grieve': Cooks feed mourners and demonstrators at the George Floyd memorial.

Author: Jackson, Sharyn

Full text: A group of volunteers in matching yellow Juneteenth T-shirts clustered in front of a grill on 38th Street, steps from the Chicago Avenue corner where George Floyd had been killed by police.
They ordered hamburgers and hot dogs and, twice, one of the group members asked what he owed the cook, Glen Walton, as if he didn't believe the answer.
"It's free, man," Walton said.
Walton, an arborist out of work since COVID-19 came to Minnesota, has spent the past month behind a grill, feeding many of the thousands of visitors and demonstrators who have come to the corner to pay respects to Floyd.
He is not alone on that south Minneapolis corner. Walton is among those who have set up tents, carts, food trucks and trailers, grills and a smoker on the streets that radiate from this intersection-turned-memorial.
While city and state officials and community members explore ways to make the site a permanent tribute to Floyd and the worldwide movement his death helped ignite, a kind of town square has emerged.
Volunteers spray visitors' hands with sanitizer, a sound system projects the voices of poets
and singers, florists cart in buckets of stems for mourners to place on the street, canvassers sign constituents up for politicians' mailing lists.
And everywhere -- at plastic picnic tables, on blankets on a grass lawn, on the curb or around the flower-ringed shrine to Floyd -- people eat.
Like a spread after a funeral, the food is comforting, nourishing, even uplifting.
"Food is how we grieve," said Nancy Alayon, owner of Qu Tal Street Eats, a Salvadoran food truck that served 2,000 free meals over two weekends at the memorial.
Many of the cooks who come and go throughout the day set up tents in small parking lots between buildings or on the street, like Walton. They park trucks on the perimeter. Or, in the case of the brick and mortar establishments on the block, like Dragon Wok, they've been there all along.
On a recent hot Friday, Dwight Alexander loaded 200 chicken wings onto a grate inside a massive barrel of a smoker in front of his takeout restaurant, Smoke in the Pit. The wings turned a deep bronze while smoke billowed over the street.
It was Alexander's first day cooking out front; he usually keeps the smoker behind his building. But he was proud of the 15-year-old workhorse that was enabling him to feed the crowds.
"I wanted them to see the original," he said.
Since these streets became a memorial site, the new customers streaming past Alexander's business are learning something important about the intersection, he said. In the past, "everybody painted this corner as a hard corner."
But with the world's eyes watching, an unspeakable tragedy became a flash point for anger and then change. The corner's true nature has been revealed, Alexander said. "It's as soft as a pillow."
He made about 1,200 wings that day. Some were sold from his storefront window. Others he offered for free to gatherers at picnic tables down the street. "They forget about the sadness for five minutes when they eat this food," Alexander said. Providing that moment of relief in the epicenter of a global movement toward racial justice, he says, makes him feels blessed.
"This is anointed ground," he said.
On the next corner, just past the welcome crew of hand-spritzers, Harold Porter has been cooking from his Phattone's Finger Food trailer since late May. The trailer is equipped with a griddle, refrigerator and deep fryer.
Porter is typically swamped with orders for cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches and fried cauliflower. He started out giving away food, but had to begin charging to keep his business afloat.
Porter usually parked his restaurant-on-wheels in St. Paul, but when he heard about Floyd, whom he considered a friend, he relocated here to be closer to the movement.
"I'm tired of white folks killing us," he said about his reason for feeding fellow mourners. "This is what I do and I love doing it," he said. "People love to eat. "
Similarly, Alayon of Qu Tal had been drawn to the corner in the aftermath of Floyd's death.
"We knew we couldn't go on with business as usual," she said. "We thought about how we could best serve our community, and we decided what we do best is feed them," she said.
The truck canceled its upcoming events, and turned to its supporters to raise about $6,000 -- enough to feed 2,000 people and donate needed toiletries to a nearby church.
Alayon was amazed at how quickly the corner became a community-run marketplace, with several food vendors rotating in and out, many of them handing out food for free. As soon as her truck ran out of meals and began to pull out of its parking spot, another cook moved in with more trays of food.
"It was organically beautiful, the flow of how that happened," she said. "Everyone was incredibly generous with their time and their resources, and we were one of many. Food brings people together."
Walton set up his tent and grill two days after the memorial emerged. He had never cooked for the public before. But he had grown up in the neighborhood, and felt "it was my duty to come down and make sure everybody eats."
There are two signs at the back of the tent: one with Walton's Venmo and Cash App names so people can send him donations; the other with the menu -- beef hot dogs, chicken and cheese sausage, watermelon, shrimp, veggie burgers and his specially seasoned "Humble Burger," because "it's made by a humble person."
Every day, Walton tallies his donations, goes to the grocery store to buy more supplies, and goes back to his spot on 38th Street. Someone donated the charcoal grill, too -- he doesn't know who.
To protect himself and others from the coronavirus, Walton applies the condiments to the meat himself, to order.
Thousands of people over the past month have flocked to the most famous corner in Minneapolis. Many have stopped by his tent, whether for a humble bite, or to fuel the fight. Does he worry about risking his health?
"Not at all," he said over the sizzle of the grill. "This is a special place."

Minnesota craft beer community reckons with race

Full text: The nationwide reckoning with racism and diversity has reached the Minnesota craft beer industry.
In the past week, Minneapolis' first Black brewery co-owner and several employees of color departed the North Loop's One Fermentary & Taproom amid a staff dispute over reopening days after the police killing of George Floyd. Meanwhile, the white CEO of 56 Brewing in northeast Minneapolis stepped down after the revelation of a 2018 incident involving a Black employee drew outrage on social media.
Mahad Muhammad, 32, is a former employee of both breweries. In his mother's native Ethiopia, brewing is a tradition, and he grew up watching her make beer.
"I used to run around in the kitchen to help her," Muhammad said. But he never thought it would lead to a career in the craft beer industry, where he would find himself at the center of the debate over race and inclusivity in Minneapolis' brewing community.
Earlier this week, 56 Brewing co-owner Kale Johnson, who is white, was accused of tying a knot resembling a noose and waving it at Muhammad, a Black man and then a 56 employee, during a March 2018 birthday party at Grumpy's Bar in Minneapolis.
The incident came to light more than two years later when a witness, Caroline Brunner, described it in a comment posted to the Instagram page of Brewing Change Collaborative, a Minnesota group that advocates for diversity and inclusion in the state's brewing industry. Brunner encouraged others to "skip 56 Brewing."
"He ended up grabbing this little tiny rope he had and made it into knots, and looked at me and said, 'Come here, boy,' " Muhammad recalled. "I said, 'Not cool,' and he said, 'Oh, I'm kidding.'"
Johnson then repeated the words "Come here, boy," according to Muhammad, but again brushed it off as a joke. In an Instagram post this week, Muhammad described the night as "one of the lowest moments in my life."
In a June 30 post on 56 Brewing's Facebook page, Johnson said he was demonstrating sailor knots and had placed a bowline knot on the table.
"There was no verbal discussion or talk of a noose or threat of hanging," the post read. "The employee said that it caused them discomfort to see the knot. I apologized immediately and said it was my fault for not realizing how it could affect others." Johnson referred to his actions as "white privileged behavior."
As hundreds of critical comments piled up on a series of posts about the incident, Johnson resigned as CEO Thursday, according to the brewery's Facebook page.
"It is apparent that my continued presence at the company is creating a negative impact to the company that I love," Johnson wrote. "I understand now that recent and past events have caused people that I care about hurt and pain and for that I am truly sorry."
A spokesperson for the Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild, a local industry group, said it is investigating a code of conduct violation by 56 Brewing. Johnson did not respond to several requests for comment.
"In no uncertain terms: Black Lives Matter," read a post on 56 Brewing's Facebook page following Johnson's resignation. "We will work tirelessly with our actions to live up to these words and ideals."
Muhammad, who left his job at 56 Brewing in August 2018, said the culture there and in the industry as a whole is unwelcoming for people of color.
"This is a nationwide epidemic," he said. "You do feel tokenized to an extent."
In recent years, the craft beer industry has drawn criticism for its handling of race and diversity issues.
A discrimination lawsuit against Michigan's Founders Brewing -- among the most prominent names in the business -- garnered national headlines when Tracy Evans, one of the company's few Black employees, alleged he was fired after complaining about the company's racist work environment.
A 2019 report released by the Brewers Association, a national trade group, found 88% of U.S. brewery owners are white and three in four are men. Just 1% of owners and 0.6% of brewers are Black, the report found.
"Similar to craft consumers, brewery employees are disproportionately white relative to both the general U.S. population and where breweries are located," the report read.
In Minnesota, an April survey of about half the state's breweries by the Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild found people of color make up just 6% of brewery employees, according to Lauren Bennett McGinty, the guild's executive director.
"I don't think that these incidents are new to the industry," Bennett McGinty said. "I do think that [they] are coming to light now because people no longer want to stay silent about racism and bigotry,"
Still, Muhammad's passion for making beer did not waver. He went on to work as an assistant brewer at One Fermentary & Taproom, a brewery that was hailed for its diversity and inclusion efforts when it opened last fall.
But last week, Ramsey Louder, one of the company's founders and the first Black co-owner of a Minneapolis brewery, announced that he had resigned on June 12. Louder wrote in a Facebook post that he realized his "vision and values differ from those of ownership of ONE," adding that he wants to create a brewery that doesn't just welcome people of color but also exists where they live.
Louder said the stress on the company during the COVID-19 outbreak reached a boiling point in the days after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Gov. Tim Walz's June 1 date for reopening bars and restaurants coincided with protests across the Twin Cities and the nation.
"The thought of reopening on June 1 didn't sit well with me," Louder said in an interview, noting that many of his employees are people of color who were out protesting every night. He said he had a difficult time convincing co-owner Sally Schmidt that One should wait to open.
When Louder stepped down, Muhammad and a several other Black, brown and Indigenous employees resigned in solidarity.
Schmidt said she is unsure how many employees quit.
"Some staff have resigned and I have heard that others may tender their resignations as well," Schmidt said. As of July 3, 75% of One's staff are people of color or LGBT, far exceeding the industry norm, she added.
Louder and Muhammad say they hope to collaborate with other people of color looking to diversify the industry and brew a new future in Minnesota.
"I am absolutely looking forward to making sure that comes to fruition," Muhammad said.

Full text: Pastor Curtis Farrar didn't want to build his church at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue.
There was a building he liked farther south at the time. But this one was available, so at the southwest corner he opened Worldwide Outreach for Christ, where he has led services for the past 38 years.
Now Farrar believes it was divine intervention that his church ended up just steps away from this south Minneapolis corner where, in late May, George Floyd was pinned to the ground by police officers and suffered his final breaths.
"I believe God planted me here," Farrar said recently. "This one event, on 38th and Chicago, caused the whole world to realize we need to change."
Farrar's church is the longest-operating institution at the intersection, which since Floyd's death has become the site of protests, memorials and a nonstop pilgrimage site for visitors from outside the city coming to pay their respects. It's still closed
off to traffic from all sides, its business fronts covered with painted plywood, flowers strewn around a makeshift roundabout honoring Floyd.
South Side residents are now beginning to brainstorm what they hope will become a permanent memorial at 38th and Chicago. With that has come a serious discussion about the past, present and future of the intersection -- and just who it belongs to.
History of racial covenants
The day after Floyd was killed, the team at Mapping Prejudice went back to their maps of 38th and Chicago. In recent years, the project cataloged racial covenants added by real estate developers in the first half of the 20th century that prevented the sale or lease of land to people of color, pushing Black people from neighborhoods and segregating cities across the country.
Sure enough, a cluster of covenants were added on lots southwest of the intersection in the late 1910s, including where Farrar's church now stands. Kirsten Delegard, the project director of Mapping Prejudice, interprets it as a "buffer" that separated the whiter neighborhoods east of Chicago Avenue from the "heart of Black Minneapolis on the South Side."
Those racial covenants became unenforceable by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948. By that point, 38th and Chicago had become a "contested area," Delegard said.
Today, the intersection serves as an axis in several ways. It is represented by two different City Council members and is the meeting point for four neighborhoods: Central, Bryant, Bancroft and Powderhorn Park.
The surrounding community has also changed over the decades. Longstanding buildings and schools were razed and homes were turned over during the Great Recession. Central and Bryant, historically Black neighborhoods, are now mixed, with majority white and Latino residents.
Marjaan Sirdar, a community organizer who lives in the Bryant neighborhood, said 38th and Chicago still acts as border, one he believes belongs to the Black community that was pushed out over the years.
"Chicago was the divide, which is why 38th and Chicago has been battled over. It's where a historic white and a historic Black community meet," he said. "This is an old battle for land; it goes back 400 years on this continent."
Problems with crime
Although the people surrounding 38th and Chicago have changed, the buildings have mostly stayed the same.
When neighbors and business owners speak about what has been there longest, the same three names pop up: Worldwide Outreach for Christ, Speedway and Cup Foods. (Their buildings even served the same purposes over the years; in the 1930s, Cup Foods was a drugstore and Speedway was a Standard Service Station.)
Ausar Lovestar opened a wireless communications business at the intersection in 1994, first in a space owned by Cup Foods and later across 38th Street. Shootings, drug dealing and other illicit acts became prevalent over the years, much of it centered around Cup Foods, he said. Neighbors said the block became a center for gang activity.
"A lot of people shied away from coming to the area as years went by because it became more violent," Lovestar said. Over the years, the city and neighborhood organizations worked to bring down crime and change the appearance of the intersection. The city pushed grants for businesses to upgrade signs and facades. Neighbors emphasized the arts, and the city assisted the Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center to move into an old movie theater next to Cup Foods.
"[It] was the opposite of Uptown," said Elizabeth Glidden, the former council member for the area. "At Uptown they were trying to control growth. At 38th and Chicago it was more about attracting investment and clarifying the vision for the area."
About 10 years ago, investor Mike Stebnitz bought the buildings directly next to SuperAmerica, now a Speedway, which had sat largely vacant for decades.
"After 10 o'clock, 38th and Chicago was a ghost town," Stebnitz, who now lives in Florida, recalled. "If there was snowfall, there would be no disruption of the snow up and down the street. It was that quiet."
One by one, he renovated the commercial spaces and brought in small businesses, including a coffee shop and photo studio. Some neighbors, including Sirdar, viewed his involvement as gentrification. But Stebnitz and others were proud to see life coming back to the intersection.
"Believe me, there were times when I had someone walk by and accuse me of doing something hideously wrong toward gentrification because I was putting flowers in front of the building," Stebnitz said. "I don't want to live in a world like that."
What comes next?
Stebnitz's buildings, like the others in the intersection, are once again boarded up. People walk up and down the sidewalk, reading the scrawl that covers the plywood in support of Floyd and against the police.
On a recent weekday night, Council Member Andrea Jenkins hosted a virtual meeting with South Side residents, who shared their views on the intersection's future. Some wanted a permanent roundabout. Others want it to remain closed to traffic.
"I hate the thought of driving over a sacred area, and that is what this corner has become," one neighbor said.
Jenkins and others said they would like a "racial healing center" where people could visit and learn about the movement toward racial justice that began with Floyd's killing.
"To me, that intersection is the soul of the city," Jenkins said in an interview. "And I think no time more than now reflects that. It actually is now the soul of the country, because the events that saw George Floyd take his last breath have led to a movement for Black lives that is encompassing the whole world."
The previous night, Farrar led a Bible study inside his church. More than 40 people listened as Farrar preached about what was to come to the intersection.
"God is getting ready to do something -- I don't know what -- to this corner," he told the congregants. "I know he expects us to have a large part in it because he knew this church was here."

Calhoun Beach Club says it is changing its name: It is the latest to drop a link to the slavery advocate, but is still finalizing its new moniker.

Full text: The historic Calhoun Beach Club apartment building in Minneapolis will soon change its name, dropping the controversial Calhoun from its 92-year-old moniker, property owners have announced.
In an e-mail last week to its apartment residents and athletic club members, the building owner, Denver-based Aimco, wrote, "Recent events have inspired deeper dialogue and discussion that we are engaging in. Today, in alliance with our broader community, we're announcing our decision to remove Calhoun from our name. Over the next few weeks, you'll see us transition to a new name; one that we are still working as a team to finalize."
John Caldwell Calhoun was a South Carolina politician who is perhaps most noted today as an ardent defender of slavery. He served in the U.S. Senate and as vice president under presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. He died in 1850.
The Calhoun Beach Club sits adjacent to the former Lake Calhoun, which was renamed Bde Maka Ska, its original Dakota name, by the Department of Natural Resources in 2018. A court battle ensued, with the Minnesota Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that the DNR had the authority to rename the lake.
Two weeks ago, the owner of the Calhoun Square retail center in Uptown announced that the killing of George Floyd and recent riots and protests about racial inequities prompted it to also change its name.
"The tragic death of George Floyd and ensuing events throughout the country have made it crystal clear that to move forward as a community we must remove painful reminders of the worst chapters in our nation's history," the building owner Northpond Partners wrote on Calhoun Square's website. "A property named for a known racist and champion of slavery has no place in Minneapolis or anywhere in our society."
Aimco officials could not be reached Tuesday.
According to websites, Calhoun Beach Club opened in 1928 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

'Black Lives Matter' policy prompts ad-agency walkout: Periscope employees had been told not to use the phrase on social media.

Author: DePASS, DEE

Full text: Periscope ad agency's parent company changed a rule forbidding employees from using "Black Lives Matter" in social media posts after 179 Minneapolis workers walked off the job on Thursday.
Employees said they wanted to use the term to show solidarity with Black and racial-justice protesters in the wake of the George Floyd killing, but were repeatedly told no by Wisconsin-based parent company, Quad.
After the walkout, Quad agreed to give Periscope editorial independence over its social media posts and promised to release employment data by race and sex. Leaders also said they would undergo diversity training and planned to increase the number of people of color hired throughout the company.
Quad CEO Joel Quadracci
apologized to Periscope employees and clients in a statement. He said the company was "slow to communicate" its commitment to ending systemic racism.
"Our integrated marketing agency Periscope in Minneapolis has witnessed firsthand the nation's reawakening to persistent, systemic racism," he said. "In recent days, our Periscope colleagues have made it clear that we, as a company, failed to act with the urgency, transparency and sensitivity required on this important social issue, and we agree. Quad can and will do better."
Nathan Young, who moved from Seattle in March to join Periscope as group strategy director, said he is still shocked that Quadracci directly ordered him to delete the phrase "Black Lives Matter" from a Periscope statement addressing systemic racism.
For a month, he was told Quad first needed to review its policies.
"The fact that as a billionaire white CEO of a company, you literally told your Black employee -- one who lives four blocks from where George Floyd was murdered -- to delete the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' from a statement of support, is a shocking dereliction of duty as a leader," Young said. "The wound that created never fully healed."
Subsequent efforts to retweet supportive messages on Facebook or Twitter prompted Quad's legal staff to intervene.
On Wednesday, Young, Periscope's three other Black employees and one LGBT worker walked off the job in protest. On Thursday, the rest of the office walked out, too. Periscope has 16 people of color on its 179-member staff.
Young is one of two advertising leaders who rallied 600 Black advertising professionals to pen a letter outlining 12 actions agencies should take to help eradicate systemic racism in their organizations.
Chief Creative Officer Peter Nicholson said Quad's initial decisions were "particularly hurtful to our people of color and to all 179 of us because of the situation we were all experiencing" in the wake of Floyd's killing.
Nicholson said he was proud of the agency for banding together.
Periscope closed Thursday for "reflection and in solidarity with our colleagues," the agency said in a statement. "We believe the day is necessary for us to reaffirm our values and our commitment to real change -- not only for ourselves but for our wider community."

Biggest win yet: Freeing prisoner: Maya Moore stepped away from the Lynx to correct a huge wrong.

Author: Youngblood, Kent

Full text: Anyone who watched the video could see the emotion. A day later Maya Moore -- relieved, exhausted, exhilarated -- remembers racing to the prison where Jonathan Irons was about to emerge, watching him walk through the doors that had kept him, being overcome.
"Well, apparently, I couldn't keep standing," Moore joked Thursday in a national video conference call. "I fell to my knees. It felt so surreal to watch him walking on the other side of those doors."
It was like winning a championship, said Moore, who should know. The former NCAA and Olympic champion helped lead the Lynx to four WNBA titles.
And now, another victory.
All the work she, her family and her legal team did trying to get Irons' conviction on robbery and assault overturned, all the sacrifice made by Moore, who stepped away from her WNBA career more than a year ago, came to fruition when the 40-year-old Irons -- convicted at age 18 -- walked through the doors of the Jefferson City (Mo.) Correction Facility.
"Just relief and gratitude, when I saw him walking out," she said. "In this journey there is so much to my life that I just do privately. … I don't really make it a huge priority to tell every single thing that I do every single day about my life. But one of the things I have wanted to share is the work in the criminal justice reform space, sharing and talking about Jonathan's life."
Moore will continue to fight for prosecutorial reform. She and Irons intend to tell his story, hoping to spur others to join the cause for reform of a criminal justice system that, she said, dehumanizes people of color.
But not right away. This was another huge win in Moore's life. Her biggest, easily. But it exacted a toll.
"It's the next-day exhaustion of, we just went to the mountaintop, and now our bodies are exhausted. Our hearts and minds are exhausted," she said. "We're walking around like zombies today. In a good way."
So, first, recovery. Any long-term talk, including basketball, can wait.
"I feel like our family needs to enter into a new season of rest for a little while," she said. "I still am very much talking about another full year of just being more rooted at home."
Lynx coach/General Manager Cheryl Reeve, in a statement released by the team, also talked of feeling overwhelmed watching the scene Wednesday. "I am overcome with joy that Maya and all involved were able to reach their goal of Jonathan's exoneration," Reeve said.
Reeve said she was angry that Moore had to leave her profession to engage in the fight against the "two-tiered criminal justice system that over polices, wrongfully convicts and over sentences Black and brown communities."
It's not over, Moore said. She will continue to work for criminal justice reform, focusing on prosecutorial misconduct. In a lengthy question-and-answer period with reporters, Moore touched on many subjects, including:
• The legacy of Irons' exoneration: "That real change happens through relationships. This journey was deep. We were invested. Jonathan was invested. If you're not committed to being deeply committed and investing over time? That's not how legacies are made. … Hopefully our story, at the very minimum, can be a foundation for people who want to get started and do something."
• How Irons' case and the response to George Floyd's killing has created the possibility for historic change: "Because we're starting to talk more about the roots of systemic racism, we can start to weed out the dehumanizing practices through these systems. Changing systems doesn't make sense until you get to the heart behind that system. By saying George Floyd was a human being. And all the lives we don't have time to talk about are human beings."
• How Irons' release after spending more than two decades of a 50-year sentence feels like a rebirth. "We were driving, racing, to the prison to get him. And I was like, 'This is what expectant fathers must be feeling as they're driving to the hospital and the baby's coming.' Everything is just so new. So I'm looking at him like a newborn in a way, of needing that time to just breathe and rest and grow and enjoy.
"But he's going to grow fast, and I know his heart is for helping people. Our family has been spoiled having him all to ourselves. … He's going to talk and speak and share and write. He has such a wealth of experience he'll be able to share. So I'm looking forward to helping him do that."

St. Paul neighborhoods look to lessons of past in riot recovery: Some fear speculators will snap up empty lots and vacant buildings to gentrify University Av.

Full text: Dai Thao stood in front of a burned-out strip mall off University Avenue, its storefronts boarded up and its neon signs stained with smoke. In the distance, the St. Paul City Council member could see a construction crane, still standing despite the destruction.
"Before COVID-19, it was booming," Thao said. "There was a lot of energy, a lot of excitement here."
Minneapolis was hit hardest when some of the protests following George Floyd's killing turned violent, but the riots struck St. Paul, too. According to data compiled by the Star Tribune, 246 buildings in St. Paul sustained damage, from smashed windows to fires. Nearly 60% of those buildings are on University Avenue, a corridor defined by a mosaic of small businesses, many owned by people of color.
The close-knit neighborhoods surrounding University Avenue have sprung into action, first helping to board
up storefronts and post "Black-owned business" signs to guard against vandalism, then returning to transform the beige plywood into brightly painted murals.
"Everything was so raw at that moment," said Alex Smith, an artist who helped paint multiple murals along the corridor, including outside the Victoria Theater. "It felt like we really needed to heal."
There's hope that this moment will be a turning point for the area, which survived the construction of Interstate 94 and the Green Line only to be hit by a pandemic and violent unrest. But there's also anxiety that the gentrification and displacement residents have long feared will arrive in a way they never expected -- that speculators will descend on vacant buildings and empty lots and erase the diversity that's been their strength.
"If we lose the Black-owned businesses, we lose the Vietnamese-owned businesses, we lose … the East African businesses, everything -- what's going to come in next?" said Sarah Nichols, who grew up in the Midway neighborhood and now lives in Rondo. "We need this to be an opportunity for community to build."
Businesses face uncertainty
Just a few months ago, the neighborhoods surrounding University Avenue -- Hamline-Midway, Union Park, Frogtown and Summit-University -- were waiting for redevelopment stemming from the Allianz Field soccer stadium.
Now, the boarded-up storefronts make the area look like it's bracing for a hurricane. In between, there are empty spaces where buildings are just gone -- of 20 buildings that burned, four were completely destroyed, data show. Thao said state help will be needed to rebuild the area, especially considering the budget shortfall the city is facing due to COVID-19.
After watching on TV as the Midway Shopping Center off University Avenue went up in flames, Mary Lau and her family were ready to get to work and reopen Peking Garden, the restaurant they've operated there since 2006. Two GoFundMe pages raised more than $20,000 to support the restaurant and its employees, and customers even offered to help clean up.
Then, at the end of June, they learned their lease was being terminated and they had just a couple weeks to vacate.
The strip mall, home to chains such as Foot Locker and Great Clips as well as small businesses, will be demolished after sustaining significant fire and water damage, according to Rick Birdoff, principal and president of RD Management LLC, the New York-based property owner. Tenants got lease termination notices last week.
The damage has accelerated plans for redevelopment at the site, which will include commercial space that will be available to local tenants, Birdoff said.
"Our hope is what we rebuild there will be something the community can be proud of," he said.
Va-Megn Thoj, executive director at Asian Economic Development Association, is skeptical that there will be space in the new development for the current businesses. Like other commercial renters along University Avenue, the survival of Midway Shopping Center tenants is uncertain, he said.
"It's going to cost a lot for some of these businesses just to recover, and that in itself is potential displacement of these businesses, because they don't have the cash to recover and reopen," Thoj said. "Or if they do, they won't be as strong as they were before."
Building a stronger future
Nieeta Presley has been here before.
The executive director of the Aurora/St. Anthony Neighborhood Development Corp. has deep roots in Rondo, a historically Black neighborhood that was torn apart to make way for I-94. Decades later, she helped guide community members and business owners through the yearslong construction of the Green Line.
COVID-19 and the civil unrest have taken a toll on multiple businesses between two development corporation properties. But Presley is convinced that a focus on art and cultural identity will heal the community, and make it stronger.
"Let's do something new and let's do something greater than before," she said. "Out of the sadness, strife, stress, there is an opportunity to envision and revision really what could be an inclusive community."
As the plywood begins to come down along University, plans are forming to create an art exhibit with the murals, said Tyler Olsen-Highness, the executive director of the Victoria Theater Arts Center. Behind Gordon Parks High School, where windows were broken, there's a park where Thao said he wants to see a sculpture symbolizing unity and peace.
"I guess the only thing that really keeps you going is hope," Presley said. "Maybe today it's stormy, but God promises a new day tomorrow."

Full text: On his fourth straight day of peaceful protest, Soren Stevenson linked arms with demonstrators gathered at the Interstate 35W on-ramp, staring down a phalanx of Minneapolis police in riot gear.
Without warning or provocation, bystanders say, officers fired a series of flash bang grenades and tear gas to disperse the crowd. A nonlethal police projectile struck Stevenson in the face, exploding his left eye and leaving him partly blinded.
Nearly a week after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis officers, the state's largest police force struggled to restore order amid unrest in its smoldering city. Although police officials acknowledge that some innocent civilians were injured during days of protests and riots, they argue that the situation required force to maintain public safety and it was difficult to distinguish between peaceful protesters and those wishing to cause harm.
But interviews with activists, elected officials and use-of-force experts suggest that police at times used extreme measures against the protesters, in violation of department policy, and missed several opportunities over the first few days to defuse tensions. Widely shared videos caught law enforcement officers indiscriminately spraying chemical irritants outside squad
cars, at nonviolent groups and in the face of a journalist held at gunpoint, whose credential was visible. In other instances, officers shot marking rounds at civilians on their own property. One business owner even testified before the state Senate that he was hit with chemical irritant by police while guarding his family's East Lake Street gas station from looters.
"It seems hard to fathom that it was a mistake," said Stevenson, 25, whose May 31 injury required several surgeries to reset facial bones and remove the eye. "We couldn't have been more than 30 feet away and I wasn't moving."
Since Floyd's death, allegations of misconduct and excessive force have poured into the city's Office of Police Conduct Review. The civilian review board is now investigating more than 400 such complaints against the MPD -- an unprecedented number that has, in a matter of weeks, surpassed annual complaint totals of previous years, officials said. And those figures are expected to rise.
While specifics of the complaints are not yet public, the Star Tribune has identified two recent cases that are under investigation. One complaint, filed internally, involves Facebook posts purportedly made by Officer David Pe±a, who used a fake name to mock protesters and encourage looting in a neighborhood that is home to much of the city's East African population.
Another is related to the actions of an unidentified Minneapolis police sergeant caught on camera pepper spraying a VICE news correspondent in the eyes even after he repeatedly identified himself as a member of the press.
Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell, who acted as a special operations spokesman during the unrest, filed an internal complaint after being alerted to the incident by a state senator, who described it as "an egregious, gratuitous attack." Schnell declined to comment further, saying "the e-mail speaks for itself."
"I believe the conduct to be wholly inappropriate and contrary to MPD policy," Schnell wrote in an e-mail that was later shared with members of Gov. Tim Walz's staff.
When asked by a reporter last month about how he would rate his department's response to the rioting, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said that tactical decisions were made based on "preservation of life."
In a more recent interview, he said that his department would take a hard look at the use of pepper spray and projectiles on protesters during mostly peaceful demonstrations. The chief has since presented a new policy that requires his authorization for any "crowd control weapons" to be used during a protest, at the behest of state officials. "That's certainly a change from allowing supervision on the ground to make that call, because of the serious nature of that kind of level of less-lethal force," Arradondo said.
For the average Minneapolis resident, the complaint filing process can be a labyrinthine, said Elizer Darris, an organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Minnesota. Those who do attempt it often lose confidence in a system that rarely results in discipline for the officers accused of wrongdoing, he said.
"Faith in that particular process has eroded pretty dramatically," said Darris.
Last month, the ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of journalists who were threatened, assaulted and arrested while covering demonstrations in the wake of Floyd's death. The organization has since turned its attention to protesters maimed at the hands of law enforcement. Several attorneys have already notified the city clerk's office that lawsuits are pending regarding injuries inflicted by police during the unrest.
Freelance journalist Linda Tirado filed a federal lawsuit against city and state law enforcement officers after losing her left eye to a police projectile while outside the Third Precinct in south Minneapolis. She is among at least two dozen people who suffered traumatic eye injuries during recent U.S. protests.
So-called kinetic impact projectiles, including rubber bullets and 40-mm "less lethal" foam rounds, are commonly used in crowd-control situations. But MPD's own use of force policy states that 40-mm rounds can cause grievous injury and should be reserved "for the incapacitation of an aggressive, noncompliant subject," and "unless deadly force is justified," officers should aim for large muscle groups in the lower extremities. The policy explicitly advises against targeting a person's head and neck.
The American Academy of Ophthalmology was so troubled by the extent of life-altering eye injuries last month that the medical group took a rare public-policy stance asking law enforcement to immediately cease use of rubber bullets as a form of crowd control.
"Americans have the right to speak and congregate publicly and should be able to exercise that right without the fear of blindness," physicians wrote in a statement. "You shouldn't have to choose between your vision and your voice."
Critics also say that tear gas is increasingly being used as a crowd dispersal tool, part of the ongoing militarization of police forces around the country.
According to best practices, the gas should only be deployed at the edge of demonstrations to minimize protesters' exposure.
But, in the days after Floyd's death, social media lit up with photos and videos of officers firing canisters into the middle of large, densely packed crowds or spraying the gas at protesters from moving vehicles.
Amid backlash, cities like Seattle and Philadelphia have temporarily stopped its use, while other places are mulling similar bans.
In Minneapolis, the debate over the post-Floyd law enforcement response followed days of intense clashes between police and demonstrators.
MPD supporters contend that police used force in response to an escalation of violence from some protesters -- pointing out that officers were pelted with bricks and bottles on a nightly basis -- and blame city leaders for allowing the riots to get out of control before intervening. There were numerous reports of officers taking gunfire in the field, though none were struck.
Authorities fired their weapons at least twice during the unrest -- once when a downtown motorist swerved into and nearly struck two police officers in a utility vehicle and again when a National Guardsman fired at a car that was driving toward a police blockade on Washington Avenue.
Some of the criticism leveled at the MPD echoed complaints made after the 18-day occupation of the Fourth Precinct police station that followed the 2015 killing of Jamar Clark. A federal after-action report found numerous instances in which officers used "less-lethal and nonlethal weapons" on protesters during the occupation, in clear violation of department policies, and often failed to document their actions. Federal officials also recommended that the department "strengthen, train on, adhere to and enforce the use of force policy -- especially as it relates to the use of chemical agents."
City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who represents the North Side, said he thinks that, had police done more to control the situation on the first night of unrest, things may not have snowballed as they did.
"Obviously, by the third night the whole situation had grown into an unmitigated disaster," said Ellison, among the most vocal proponents of dismantling the police force. "The tactics being used by protesters [on the first night] seemed mild enough that you could have successfully de-escalated the situation."

Duluth police reiterate: Chokeholds are deadly force

Full text: DULUTH - The Duluth Police Department outlined updates -- most of them formalities -- to its use of force policies on Thursday, with Chief Mike Tusken saying chokeholds are considered deadly force and had already been out of practice for decades.
"After the tragic death of George Floyd, our community requested an audit of our policies and to assure them we are aligned with the best practices in policing," Tusken said.
The timing allows the department to add and clarify policies to "provide clearer direction to our officers about our expectations and foster better community understanding."
Officers will continue to be required to follow de-escalation tactics and exhaust all alternatives before shooting.
"Communication is the number one tool our officers use when they're out in the field," Tusken said. "Having the capacity to use less lethal tools to resolve potentially lethal encounters is another way we are poised to save the lives of people who are experiencing a crisis today but through good tactics, training and tools, can live tomorrow."
Tusken said a "duty to intervene" policy was updated to state that "regardless of tenure or rank, officers must intervene verbally or physically if another officer is using force outside of policy and training."
Four former Minneapolis police officers have been charged in the murder of George Floyd on Memorial Day. For nearly eight minutes, officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, even as Floyd, who was handcuffed, said he could not breathe, and three other officers stood by and did not intervene.
In 2019 Duluth police had more than 100,000 interactions with the public and made 3,500 arrests; use of force was recorded in 158 incidents. In 2018 police used force 151 times; use of force was reported 150 times in 2017.
Other policy updates and clarifications include:
• Warning required before shooting.
• No shooting at moving vehicles.

Not party time: 2020 Aquatennial is canceled

Full text: Aquatennial organizers, citing the absence of that celebratory feeling, announced Thursday that this year's activities scheduled for later this month in Minneapolis are canceled.
"We will miss seeing you in person this year," read a statement from the Minneapolis Downtown Council.
The business group went on to cite two key reasons: the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on public health along with the city's challenges following the killing of George Floyd on May 25 by police.
"Our community continues to navigate the realities of COVID-19 and its impacts on public health," the statement continued. "We will always prioritize community safety over celebrations. More importantly, Minneapolis is still reeling from the death of George Floyd. Our community has been deeply impacted by his tragic death and the unrest that followed."
Summing up, the statement said, "It does not feel like it is time to celebrate. We want to take the time to honor our community and give space for the important work that needs to be done."
Minneapolis' annual summer party began in 1940 and offers many free events that draw thousands of people downtown. They include the Torchlight Parade, a 5K run and fireworks.
This year's events were scheduled to run from July 22-25. Organizers have scheduled the 2021 Aquatennial for July 21-24.
Leah Wong, the council's vice president for external relations, said the group made the decision on Wednesday, just three weeks before festivities were to start.
Wong said the group "tried to hold off until the last possible moment" while assessing various scales of celebration.
"We were really working hard to bring this celebration forward," she said, going over "multiple plans since April … on how we could do a social-distanced Aquatennial."
Ultimately, this summer's Aquatennial will be a strictly virtual affair that will include coloring pages, jigsaw puzzles, a scavenger hunt and more. Visit aquatennial.com/aquativities for more information.

Speed bumps added to slow traffic near Floyd memorial

Full text: Over the past month, thousands of people have flocked to a memorial in the south Minneapolis intersection where George Floyd died.
The constant flow of visitors is wearing on residents who live near 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue. They are contacting city officials with complaints about parking, increased traffic and speeding drivers cutting through the neighborhood to get around the intersection that has been closed since May 25, when Floyd died while being detained by Minneapolis police.
"Neighborhood residents have called, sent text messages, DMs [direct messages] and e-mails, it's been a burden," said Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins, who represents the ward where the colorful memorial is located. "There are such tremendous problems near the site."
To address residents' concerns, the Minneapolis Public Works Department is installing temporary speed humps on side streets and alleys adjacent to the memorial.
"This is unique," said Steve Mosing, traffic operations engineer for the city. "There's the memorial and it's drawing traffic, and with the closure you have traffic trying to make connections around it. We hope this deters drivers to stay on the arterial system and use detours that are in place."
Arterial streets are main thoroughfares with a higher traffic capacity than neighborhood streets. With 38th and Chicago closed, the city is directing north-south traffic from Chicago to use Park, Portland and Bloomington avenues. Drivers making east-west movements on 38th Street have been detoured to 42nd Street.
Crews are putting in speed humps made from compacted gravel on the 3700 block of Columbus Avenue and the 3800 blocks of 10th and Elliot avenues. The humps, a foot or two high, are similar to those the city uses to cover plastic pipes placed along streets to provide temporary water service while water mains are repaired. Two humps will be placed on each block, Mosing said.
"The best results to slow traffic is to put them in pairs," Mosing said.
Flat plastic speed bumps, similar to those seen in parking lots, will be bolted to the pavement in alleys behind 10th and Elliot avenues. Signs warning drivers of the speed bumps will be posted, Mosing said.
The city will monitor the traffic and determine if more humps might be needed in the area. The humps will be removed around November.
"We hope this resolves the issue of speed and traffic volume," he said.

Confederate flag in S.D. must go, Floyd uncle says

Full text: A relative of George Floyd said now is the time for police in his little South Dakota town of Gettysburg to remove an image from their logo that he feels belongs on the trash heap of history -- the Confederate flag.
Selwyn Jones, as one of a handful of black residents in the prairie town named for the tide-turning battle of the Civil War, promises to make his voice heard when the City Council on Monday takes up the fate of the logo bearing the signature symbol that Southern troops flew in their mission to preserve slavery.
Jones, 54, whose late sister is Floyd's mother, made his vow Monday as he drove back to South Dakota from Minneapolis, where he sat in the hearing for the four fired Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's May 25 death.
" 'Bill, we really have the Confederate flag on our police uniforms?' " Jones recalled saying three weeks ago in a phone call to Mayor William Wuttke on the same day he attended his nephew's funeral in Houston. "Man, that's got to go."
Jones said the mayor responded with, " 'We'll see about it.' … That's what a white guy in control and power says. We'll see about it. ... Whatever."
On Tuesday, Wuttke told the Star Tribune that the Police Department is "working on something different," but it's happening against his wishes, the will of most everyone in town of roughly 1,200 and is being pushed by outsiders.
"We're not wanting the liberals and the press telling us we have to change it," he said. "People here do not feel it's racism.
"It's so ridiculous; 99% of the people don't have any idea [that the Confederate flag is on the insignia]. It's just something that's there. I've had more local people in favor of it than against it."
Two days after speaking with the mayor, Jones wrote a message on Facebook to his community, where he and his wife are raising two children and where he runs a motel, expressing confidence that the two-person police force's insignia will be changed.
"I know my neighbors will listen in order to understand the history of hurt that African-Americans and other people of color have experienced," wrote Jones, who moved to Gettysburg three years ago. "I am also sure that the flag issue in Gettysburg will be resolved because the killing of my nephew George Floyd is offensive to all lovers of freedom."
The insignia as currently designed has been on the police vehicle, uniforms and elsewhere on department property since 2009. It is composed of equally sized American and Confederate flags, with a cannon below where the flags' poles cross.
Wuttke, who's been involved in local politics for more than 20 years, said the council was presented two redesign options by the police chief at the time, Gayle Kludt.
Quite simply, Wuttke said, "She was asked which one you like, and she chose that one."
The 21st-century battle of Gettysburg in the town about 350 miles straight west of Minneapolis comes as disputes across the country flare up over the display of the Confederate flag and monuments named for prominent figures in American history who supported slavery, pushed Native Americans off their land or espoused racist viewpoints.
Police Chief Dave Mogard could not be reached for comment, but at a special council session called on June 12, he said a redesign is needed to the patch he has worn on his uniform since joining the department in 2018.
"I am not against the current patch, but I am not for the current patch," Mogard said. "My opinion is this: Would you put the Confederate flag on your business or your home? If you are not willing to put the Confederate flag on your business or your home, then why is it being forced upon our agency?"
In 2015, city leaders firmly defended the insignia amid debate over the Confederate flag after the deadly shooting in South Carolina at a historically black church by a racist infatuated with the Civil War South.
"This patch has no racist intentions," a Facebook posting by the city read at the time. "It is meant to be another way that we, as a city, represent our heritage. … The Chief of Police, Bill Wainman, the Mayor, Bill Wuttke, and the City Council have no intentions of changing the police patch."
The insignia's designer, Scott Barksdale, backed up the city's argument and explained the crossed Confederate and American flags are meant to show how Civil War survivors came together in South Dakota and "put the past behind them."
The Gettysburg on the prairie was settled in 1883 by veterans on both sides of the Civil War among others and named for the battle "to honor their fallen comrades and to acknowledge those men who had survived," according to the city's website.
The historical rationale behind the insignia's design isn't flying with a newfound friend of Jones, 19-year-old South Dakotan Caitlin Kroemer. She has collected more than 4,000 signatures on change.org in the campaign to rid the Confederate flag from the police emblem.
"South Dakota did not exist until 24 years AFTER the Civil War," her petition reads. "The confederacy was a blatantly racist organization that is not a fundamental part of our state's history. … This heritage is not ours, it has no place here."
Kroemer, a political science major at the University of South Dakota, said she and Jones have been in touch about how to approach the council next week, and "he's encouraged me to keep going."
With the cause of justice for his nephew as inspiration, Jones reflected for a moment about his nephew, who he and other relatives knew by his middle name, Perry.
"What are the chances of me being Perry Floyd's uncle, then what's the chance of Perry Floyd's uncle living in a town with that flag on the uniform?"
