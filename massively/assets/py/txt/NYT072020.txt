WASHINGTON — Joe Biden has entered the final stage of his deliberations about choosing a running mate as he prepares to talk one-on-one with the finalists next week, while Democratic leaders lobby him furiously to elevate their allies and sink their enemies.
Biden’s campaign has conducted extensive polling and focus groups with voters on a collection of candidates and weighed an array of factors, such as the impact of the pick in battleground states and whether to choose a Black woman. Aides said the announcement will come the week before the Democratic convention in August.
Two candidates who received scant attention early in the process are now among the most formidable contenders: Rep. Karen Bass of California and Susan Rice, the former national security adviser, according to Democratic officials briefed on the selection process. Bass in particular has moved rapidly toward the top of Biden’s list amid an intensive lobbying drive by her fellow House Democrats, including prominent members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
Biden is said to be focused on finding a running mate he regards as capable of advancing his priorities in governing and who can be counted on not to stray from the urgent challenges facing the nation to pursue their own political priorities, according to people familiar with his thinking. His advisers would also prefer a running mate who would not present a rich political target for President Donald Trump, given that the incumbent is lagging badly in the polls and has so far struggled to deliver credible negative attacks against Biden.
James Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat who helped revive Biden’s campaign in South Carolina, said he had been bombarded by supporters of several candidates.
“I’ve heard from the surrogates of about all the people in the race,” said Clyburn, who did not rule out making a late, private recommendation to Biden.
In conversations with Biden and his vetting committee, lawmakers have recommended Bass as a consensus candidate who is well-liked across partisan and factional lines and would be a loyal lieutenant to him in government.
Bass has reinforced that message by assuring Democratic officials that she has no interest in seeking the presidency herself, according to lawmakers directly familiar with the discussions. That commitment could assuage concerns in the Biden camp that he might be overshadowed by a running mate positioning herself to succeed him.
Bass has also waged a previously undisclosed campaign to woo influential liberal leaders, telephoning union presidents to seek their counsel and support.
“I had a great conversation with Karen Bass,” said Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, adding that Bass had made her interest in the vice presidency clear. “She talked to me about how real it was.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is close with Bass, whom she named to oversee the recent policing reform bill, and has made her admiration clear in private conversations, including with former President Barack Obama. Pelosi’s aides said she has not conveyed support for any one candidate, is fond of a number of them and, in speaking with Biden’s vetting team last month, urged them to find somebody who could ensure the ticket is victorious.
Two prominent Democrats, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, along with a handful of other women, remain as possibilities; both lawmakers have the statewide political experience and large national followings that Bass and Rice lack. Warren has become something of an informal adviser to Biden on economic issues and has won support from her party’s progressive wing, and Harris is regarded as a muscular fundraiser with the backing of important people in the Democratic Party’s donor class.
While Biden’s advisers are careful to stress that he has not ruled out any of the major candidates, some are clearly less likely than others to be chosen. For some of the long-shot candidates, talk has already turned to other potential roles in a Biden administration: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, for instance, has expressed interest in the job of health and human services secretary, according to officials familiar with her thinking.
Among the other candidates Biden has looked at closely are Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan; Rep. Val Demings of Florida, who has enlisted her home state’s sizable congressional delegation to make appeals on her behalf; and Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who is backed by veterans advocates.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois has called Biden’s team to urge them to put Duckworth, a military veteran, on the ticket; and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has shared his high opinion of the combat-wounded Duckworth with the Biden camp, people familiar with the conversations said.
Some contenders have been trying to position themselves in the same fashion as Bass. Harris and Rice have asked senior Democratic officials to make their case to Biden and the vetting committee. Harris has also reached out to some labor leaders, and Demings has contacted some of Biden’s longtime allies.
The former vice president’s decision has become both enormously consequential and highly delicate because of the unresolved question of whether, should he win in November, he would seek reelection in four years, when he would be nearly 82 years old. With his selection, Biden may be effectively coronating the next Democratic presidential nominee and charting the party’s course for the next decade.
This is why some progressives are hoping he balances the ticket by picking a more liberal running mate.
“It shouldn’t be someone that just amplifies what Biden does well,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. “It should be somebody that brings new constituencies to the table.”
Some of his top advisers, however, are warning against tapping somebody who would begin eyeing the next Democratic primary as a Biden administration races to secure a vaccine for the coronavirus and revive the economy.
“There’s going to be an awful lot to do starting on day one, so I think it’s important to have somebody who can be focused on that task and not running for president as soon as we finish the inauguration,” said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, one of Biden’s campaign chairs.
Biden’s top aides have made clear the premium he places on a trusting relationship is informed by his own experience as a vice president — and he will not make a nakedly political choice, a determination made easier by the sizable advantage he enjoys over Trump in the polls.
“The Bidens are looking for somebody as loyal to them as they were to Barack and Michelle Obama,” said Christine Pelosi, the daughter of the speaker.
Biden’s campaign is angry about a leak to Politico this week that revealed that former Sen. Christopher Dodd, one of the leaders of Biden’s search team, is uneasy with Harris, believing it will make Biden’s selection more awkward. Dodd has repeatedly indicated to allies that he believed Biden should broaden the prospects and not focus on only well-known possibilities.
Dodd is scarcely alone in his lack of enthusiasm for Harris, whose own presidential campaign never matched its high expectations; she dropped out two months before voting began.
“The thing I keep thinking about Kamala is her performance in the primary,” said Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas, an early supporter of Biden. Vela said his top three choices were Bass, Rice and Duckworth — but he said the last two would fare best in his state.
Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa echoed that view of Duckworth and said Demings, too, would have wide appeal because of her former career as a police chief.
One Democrat close to Biden’s campaign said its polling indicated that Harris has little allure with Black voters. More telling, a Biden campaign official reached out to The New York Times, unprompted, to say that some of the former vice president’s own staff members are not supportive of her.
California Democrats, including several in Congress, have expressed their wariness about Harris to Biden’s advisers. In some cases, they have guided him in the direction of Bass, who is highly regarded in her home state.
David Crane, a Democrat and former top adviser to Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was governor of California, said he had reached out to Biden’s camp to tell them Bass was “a good person who cares about legislation.” He said he conveyed his belief that she would be a far better partner for Biden than Harris, who he said did not “walk her talk” on policy.
“They’ve got to pick somebody who really knows how to govern,” Crane said, stressing what he described as Bass’ gift for steering complex legislation. “Karen Bass knows how to do that. Kamala Harris has never been in that position.”
Harris does have allies.
“I think the world of her,” said former Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who spoke with Harris on Thursday.
“You only need to look at her record at the local, state and federal levels to know that she’d be a quality, experienced partner who’s ready to lead on day one,” added Rusty Hicks, who also praised Bass and is neutral in his capacity as chair of the California Democratic Party.
While Rice has a close relationship with Biden, many in the party are wary of elevating somebody who has never run for office.
Bass, too, has drawbacks. She has never been in a setting comparable to a high-stakes debate with Vice President Mike Pence. And in private vetting conversations, members of Biden’s team have also asked Bass to explain aspects of her record on Cuba: She took a trip to the country as a teenager and issued a respectful statement of condolence when Fidel Castro died in 2016. Bass has said publicly that she had reconsidered those comments and would not make them again.
Clearly, though, Biden is facing the most intense lobbying to choose a Black running mate.
A small group of strategists and activists who have been pressing for a Black woman recently spoke with members of the search committee, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. They discussed the electoral map and how the political environment in the country had shifted following the killing of George Floyd in police custody in May.
When given the opportunity to make a case for a specific candidate, participants indicated their support of any of the Black women considered, but Harris and Rice came up the most, the people familiar with the conversation said. They noted that the meeting unfolded before it was evident how seriously Bass was being considered.
In the House, there’s a groundswell for Bass. Several Democratic lawmakers have made the case for her to Biden’s advisers.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a centrist leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, called Bass “a bridge-builder” who “wants to figure out how to get to yes.”
Rep. Ro Khanna of California, an outspoken progressive, was equally succinct: “She’d be a pick that every part of the Democratic coalition would respect and be excited about.”

NEW YORK — Around 3 a.m. one day this past spring, a math teacher at Mott Haven Academy was stirred awake by the buzz of a text message. It was from a student, who wrote that his mother had just died from the coronavirus.
The Bronx charter school, still in the process of switching to remote learning, sprang into action. The child’s teachers huddled to plan both for his grieving process and how to soothe his classmates, and the school helped the family cover funeral costs.
Mott Haven Academy was unusually well prepared to confront a death in the community — and to help its students weather the coronavirus — because it was built to handle crises. Mott Haven, which has an elementary and middle school, reserves most of its roughly 460 seats for students in the child welfare system and uses an array of social services to offer them much more than academics.
Now schools around the nation that serve vulnerable children may have little choice but to adopt the unconventional measures that those like Mott Haven and Broome Street Academy, a charter high school in Manhattan that serves about 300 similarly at-risk students, have used since the pandemic hit.
Doctors affiliated with the two New York schools mailed students antidepressants or birth control pills, teachers added families who could no longer pay bills to their personal cellphone plans, and administrators gave cash grants to parents who had lost jobs.
All of this was in addition to ensuring schoolwork was adapted for remote learning, underscoring how the challenges facing schools in September include more than just preparing English and math lessons and instead encompass every facet of a student’s life.
Millions of students in large cities and suburban districts will not physically return to classrooms this fall, and New York’s 1.1 million public school students will likely attend school in person only a few days a week.
Black, Hispanic and low-income children who have endured both devastating health outcomes and serious economic devastation from the virus need creative solutions when they cannot be in school, said Bill Baccaglini, chief executive of the New York Foundling, the social service agency that founded Mott Haven.
“I think the entire system has missed something if they don’t rethink what the fall semester looks like,” he said.
Mott Haven’s ties to the Foundling and Broome Street’s to the Door, based in SoHo, give both schools connections to large, nonprofit social service agencies that focus on at-risk children.
The two schools offer a slew of services for tens of thousands of children and families each year, including physical and mental health care, legal assistance and help finding housing.
Most public schools do not have those resources or the ability to add new services, especially with the significant budget cuts prompted by the coronavirus crisis.
But schools that serve predominantly low-income children, long tasked with providing nonacademic help, will have little choice but to redouble that work whenever a profoundly traumatized class of students reports back to school.
Melissa Silberman, the principal of Broome Street, started thinking about how to protect her students and their families weeks before schools were shuttered.
“We have young people who have a high degree of trauma; even the very act of shutting abruptly is traumatic for them since they see Broome Street as a home,” she said. Many of Broome Street’s students came from some of the worst-performing middle schools in the city.
In March, teachers at the school showed students how to log on to their online learning portal, had them save their social workers’ cellphone numbers and created an email hotline for questions from families. Broome Street distributed more than 100 laptops for the many students who did not have computers at home.
“Because we are a school built around a high degree of intervention, we were able to pivot in a way that has just been shocking,” Silberman said.
Still, Broome Street’s staff and students have continued to face enormous challenges.
Shortly after protests against police brutality erupted in New York City, a student reached out to the guidance staff, asking for an emergency appointment. The teenager had recently lost a family member to the coronavirus and had just left a protest where her brother was pepper-sprayed by police.
The school was able to schedule a remote therapy session quickly because it has five social workers for its roughly 350 students.
In contrast, in 2018, the city’s traditional public schools had an average of one guidance counselor for roughly every 380 students and one social worker for every 716 students, according to a city Department of Education report.
About one-third of the students at Broome Street receive weekly counseling — including a transgender teenager in a group home who has to use a pay phone in a hallway for therapy sessions during the pandemic. Every student at the school received a weekly wellness check-in via email in the spring.
Aniyah Stoves, a recent graduate, relied on those meetings. Her stress mounted after she lost a job she loved at the Guggenheim Museum when the city shut down, and younger siblings running around the house made it hard to focus on schoolwork. In the spring, she said, “I got overwhelmed and felt like I was bearing too much.”
Since 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio has directed more than 100 low-income schools to add more social services. That started when the city’s economy was booming, but he cut about $9 million for those so-called community schools in the latest city budget. That move, activists said, shows just how unprepared the city is to support its neediest children.
“You have this massive number of kids who will fall through the cracks because the city didn’t coordinate services for them,” said Eric Weingartner, chief executive of the Door.
Weingartner said Broome Street was able to prevent calamity for its students and families in the spring because it offered such a variety of services.
“Whatever crisis kids are going through,” he said, “it’s never just one thing.”
That is why Jessica Nauiokas, Mott Haven’s principal, spent the first few weeks of the lockdown figuring out how to get cash and food into the homes of the school’s most vulnerable children so that they could eventually focus on their studies.
Jennifer Curet, a single mother of five who lives in the South Bronx, said the school helped her manage some of the most difficult months of her life.
“There were a lot of times I wanted to give up because it was too much for me,” Curet said. Had it not been for Mott Haven, “I probably wouldn’t have home-schooled. I probably would have skipped it.”
A social worker helped make school schedules for her four children who attend Mott Haven, which she then pasted on the walls of her apartment. Curet said she received multiple Amazon packages a week filled with crayons, construction paper and other supplies to keep her children busy and had frequent calls with the guidance counselor to talk about her own anxiety and how to decompress.
“Every day was like Christmas,” she said.
Nauiokas said dozens of single parents needed help with grocery shopping, so school staff started making supermarket runs for those families.
One family that was not eligible for governmental help because of its immigration status had to close its small hair salon after the virus hit. The school gave the family a cash grant for rent and sent gift cards.
Nauiokas said the trauma and disruption of the pandemic had created an opportunity to improve public schools drastically for students who needed them to be their anchor. “It would be a shame if we went back to the same status-quo system that was underserving kids of color,” she said.
The Door, which houses Broome Street Academy and provides services for its students and roughly 11,000 other children each year, also saw its clients’ lives begin to unravel, and rushed to adapt.
The organization took over part of a midtown Manhattan hotel and transformed it into an isolation unit for homeless children with the coronavirus, complete with youth counselors and medical staff. The Door’s medical team has sent scores of uninsured teenagers medicine, eyeglasses and HIV tests. A team of lawyers who handle immigration cases met with teenagers in parks so they could sign legal documents while maintaining social distance.
But there was still so much adults could not do for the children they serve.
Baccaglini of the Foundling said he sometimes struggled to sleep, thinking about children in unstable homes who could no longer rely on their school buildings as safe zones.
“Are we worried that abuse and neglect is higher? Without a doubt,” he said. “It’s the thing that keeps me up at night. I know what I know, but what I don’t know is what’s going to hurt.”
Baccaglini said that the Foundling would pay for tutoring for Mott Haven’s eighth-grade graduates throughout their high school careers elsewhere and that it was mulling other ways to help.
Jardy Santana, a fourth-grade teacher at Mott Haven, said her experiences teaching during the pandemic so far had left little doubt that she would need to take a drastically different approach in September.
Santana said she spent months trying to keep track of one student who would for weeks cheerfully respond to calls, only to disappear for days. And every morning in the spring, Santana retaught the day’s lesson by phone with one student who did not have internet access.
Santana said she had received countless text messages from families, all with a similar plea: “I need help” — with home-schooling, with food and money, with anxiety and grief.
“Our students have faced losses of family members. I can’t imagine just jumping into the school year and saying, ‘Let’s open up this book and get started,’” Santana said. “There has to be a place and a time where we process this together, how it has impacted us, how we have changed.”

O: The Oprah Magazine has covered a wide swath of American culture since it started 20 years ago, but all of its 241 issues have had one thing in common: Oprah Winfrey, the publication’s founder and editorial director, has been on the cover.
That will change with the September issue, which will be available on newsstands Aug. 11. The new cover, unveiled Thursday, features a portrait of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in March.
Winfrey started an essay for the issue with her name, writing:
“Breonna Taylor.
“She was just like me. She was just like you.”
Winfrey ended the essay by explaining why she had decided to give up the cover spot of her namesake magazine: “What I know for sure: We can’t be silent. We have to use whatever megaphone we have to cry for justice.
“And that is why Breonna Taylor is on the cover of O magazine.”
Along with George Floyd, the Black man who was killed by a Minneapolis officer in May, Taylor has been a central figure for protesters who have taken to the streets to demonstrate against racism and police violence in recent months.
No criminal charges have been filed against the three Louisville Metro Police Department officers who entered the home of Taylor, an emergency medical technician, shortly after midnight March 13.
Last month, Brett Hankison, one of the three officers, was fired. The police chief, Robert Schroeder, accused him of violating the department’s policy on the use of deadly force, saying he had “wantonly and blindly” fired 10 shots into Taylor’s home. The other two officers were reassigned.
Taylor was shot at least eight times. She did not receive medical attention for more than 20 minutes after she was struck, The Courier Journal reported, citing police logs. The officers involved in the case have said they identified themselves when they entered; Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who was present, said police did not identify themselves.
Louisville police said that Walker shot and wounded one officer in the leg and charged him with the attempted murder of a police officer. That charge was dismissed in May.
The idea of putting Taylor on the O cover was the brainchild of Deirdre Read, the magazine’s visual research editor, said Lucy Kaylin, the editor-in-chief of O, in an email.
“I brought the idea to Oprah, who immediately said ‘YES,’ ” Kaylin said.
The cover image is a rendition of a selfie by Taylor created by digital portrait artist Alexis Franklin.
On Wednesday, O’s publisher, Hearst Magazines, and Winfrey announced that O would discontinue regular print editions and become more digitally focused. “This is a natural progression for the brand,” Kristen O’Hara, Hearst Magazines chief business officer, said in a statement. The company added that the December issue will be O’s last regular monthly print edition.
Average paid circulation for O has fallen over the years, from a high of 2.75 million shortly after its founding, in 2001, to 2.28 million in the second half of last year, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.
On June 5, what would have been Taylor’s 27th birthday, the hashtag #SayHerName was widely shared in a social media campaign that included the participation of Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.
Winfrey invoked Taylor’s full name frequently in her essay for the issue, writing, “Breonna Taylor treated all her friends like besties. Breonna Taylor was a force in the life of her 20-year-old sister. Breonna Taylor felt meaning and purpose in her work as an emergency room technician.”

Why Barr’s Pick for Brooklyn Prosecutor Faces Scrutiny From All Sides [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — When Attorney General William Barr announced a new top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn this month, it was a promotion for one of his closest advisers in Washington.
His choice, Seth DuCharme, was not a purely political appointee. DuCharme spent most of his career in Brooklyn prosecuting terrorists and violent gangs, earning a sterling reputation among many law enforcement officers and defense lawyers.
Still, DuCharme, 49, is stepping into the position at a fraught time for any U.S. attorney whose office has the jurisdiction to investigate President Donald Trump’s associates. With the election just over three months away and as political polarization intensifies across the country, DuCharme is facing scrutiny from all sides.
“Look, I know people have strong views about this administration and folks in D.C.,” DuCharme said in an interview with The New York Times. “And all I guess I would ask of them is, let’s see how I do.”
DuCharme seemed keenly aware of the appearances surrounding his promotion. But he said that using the office to advance an inappropriate political agenda would be “inconsistent with every fiber of my being.”
Last month, Barr and the president ousted DuCharme’s counterpart in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, whose office had clashed with the Justice Department over sensitive investigations, including the decision to charge Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer.
The current environment demands a delicate dance by U.S. attorneys in high-profile districts. They must get approval from the Justice Department in Washington to charge certain cases while preserving enough independence to maintain credibility with their own rank-and-file prosecutors.
“These are not normal times,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at Columbia Law School. “There’s a new risk here that somebody dispatched from Washington, even with his own distinguished personal history, will be seen as some minion of the attorney general.”
DuCharme’s office, also known as the Eastern District of New York, has jurisdiction that includes Brooklyn, Long Island and Queens. Like its counterpart in Manhattan, the office is pursuing investigations that have touched the president’s associates.
Last year, Brooklyn prosecutors subpoenaed Trump’s inaugural committee and interviewed Thomas Barrack, a top fundraiser and close friend of Trump.
The office has indicted Chinese tech company Huawei, inflaming tensions between the United States and China, and is negotiating with Goldman Sachs to settle the bank’s role in a scheme that stole billions of dollars from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.
DuCharme, a registered Republican, has returned to a community of largely left-leaning prosecutors and defense lawyers in New York, some of whom have privately questioned whether he can push back against Barr when necessary.
Longtime colleagues and even courtroom adversaries of DuCharme said he had a lengthy track record of pursuing cases without partisan motivation, serving under both Republican and Democratic presidents. He rose to become chief of the criminal division in Brooklyn before his 15-month stint in Washington.
“I understand the skepticism, and I’m a flaming liberal, but Seth is a great choice,” said Michael Bachrach, a defense lawyer whose clients had been prosecuted by DuCharme. “He’s someone that both sides of the political gamut can be comfortable with.”
John Gleeson, a retired federal judge who presided over some of DuCharme’s cases, said he was confident that DuCharme would preserve the office’s independence. “I have no reason to think otherwise, based on my interactions with him,” Gleeson said.
DuCharme became the acting U.S. attorney July 10 through an unusual legal maneuver that allows the president to designate a temporary replacement for up to 210 days.
In effect, Barr arranged for DuCharme to switch jobs with Richard Donoghue, who had served as the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn since January 2018.
As DuCharme returned to Brooklyn, Donoghue took DuCharme’s old place in the Justice Department office that oversees the nation’s federal prosecutors, positioning him to rise should Trump win reelection.
Earlier this year, the Justice Department assigned Donoghue to coordinate investigations involving Ukraine — a sensitive role, given that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, broke lobbying laws in his dealings there.
At a congressional hearing Tuesday, Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., suggested that Barr had installed DuCharme as a way to exert more control over those investigations, although it was not clear whether the role would stay in Brooklyn after Donoghue’s departure.
In Washington, DuCharme had also served for nine months as a counsel to Barr and was closely involved in the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe, according to emails obtained by the watchdog group American Oversight.
Democrats in Congress have accused Barr of pursuing the investigation with political motives to justify Trump’s contention that the FBI had no legitimate reason to investigate his campaign.
DuCharme was an architect of the Justice Department’s approach to the MS-13 street gang. Last week, the department announced a case that charged an alleged MS-13 leader with a terrorism crime for the first time.
He also advised Barr not to bring federal charges against a police officer in the 2014 death of Eric Garner in Staten Island. The decision followed a yearslong debate inside the Justice Department under both the Obama and Trump administrations.
DuCharme grew up in a different Brooklyn — a rural town with the same name in Connecticut. He is a lifelong hunter who hung an elk head from his office wall for many years. He also writes poetry and has performed his work at live venues in New York.
After graduating from Hamilton College, DuCharme worked as a federal marshal in Brooklyn, chasing fugitives and driving inmates on buses. While he was attending law school at Fordham University, the Sept. 11 attack happened, fueling his desire to become a counterterrorism prosecutor, he said.
At the Eastern District, his signature initiative was a program that offered alternative outcomes for people who could have faced terrorism-related charges. For instance, some defendants were charged with fraud, allowing them to avoid the stigma of a terrorism conviction.
Deirdre von Dornum, the chief federal defender in Brooklyn, recalled one plea deal that DuCharme had negotiated: He allowed a mentally ill young man who had run at a law enforcement officer with a knife in his pocket to be released into therapy after a year in prison.
“Seth was willing to listen no matter how frightening the facts were,” von Dornum said. “He really does see every defendant as a person.”
DuCharme takes over an office where morale has suffered in recent months, partly because of Donoghue’s heavy-handed reaction to the civil unrest in New York City, according to people familiar with the office.
Last month, Donoghue brought an indictment that stacked a series of terrorism-related charges against two lawyers accused of firebombing an empty police car so they would face a 45-year mandatory minimum sentence if convicted on all counts.
That decision sparked debate in the office. The supervising prosecutor on the case objected to Donoghue’s approach and asked to be switched to another role, according to people familiar with the dispute.
DuCharme has recused himself from the case because his wife, Dyan Finguerra-DuCharme, is a partner at a law firm that employed one of the defendants. Asked if he would have brought the same indictment, DuCharme responded, “I don’t know. That’s a hard hypothetical to answer.”
Because his tenure may be short — if Joe Biden defeats Trump, he could nominate a new slate of U.S. attorneys — DuCharme said he would focus in the near term on violent crime, given the recent rise in shootings.
“I have no doubt I will disappoint some folks,” he said. “But if you look at where I’ve come from, how long I’ve worked here and the amount of time I’ve had to build empathy with this community, give me a chance.”

When someone wants to explain where the country’s been since Memorial Day, they refer to The Moment. “The Moment,” at first, seemed to name a finite period, the killing of George Floyd on May 25, and the moments his death comprised. “The Moment” then proved spongy quick, absorbing the bewildering madness of the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and expanding into more protests in more corners of the planet than seemed fathomable. (The demonstrations took place during a pandemic; The Moment had swelled inside a Moment.) It appealed to people whose response to such Moments has tended to be less than vociferous: white people. White people marched and chanted. They ate tear gas and pepper spray. White people said, “Black Lives Matter,” “systemic racism,” and, occasionally, “reparations.”
Questions arose about what The Moment was and what should be asked of it. The Moment brought us new vision to see old wrongs and emboldened us to raze and ruin them. The Moment reversed power. Mayors stood among civilians, police took a knee, a president had been absconded into a bunker. This Moment was the sort that Black America had been waiting for — when the woke learned to walk, when the Confederate flag ceased official operation as a security blanket, when even a beloved music trio had to concede that “Dixie” no longer becomes them.
So here we are, still in this Moment, tasked to behold the changing of names and the signaling of virtue. Waiting for meaningful legislative reform, seizing matters with civilian hands in the meantime: recasting jobs; reclaiming parks and pedestals and city streets, these local reclamations, seemingly one public space at a time. The speed of change in a country notoriously allergic to it feels like a spree, reckoning as a marathon of “Supermarket Sweep.” We know The Moment is connected to other moments, yet there’s a sense in our bones that it differs from them. Who knows when such a Moment might come along again?
Before it vanishes, the centuries and conditions that produced it warrant commemoration. They warrant further confrontation, reclamation and connection. They warrant an event — broadcast across the country, over months, not days — that squares the present with the past, that explains The Moment to those who say they are, at last, awake to it. This Moment of historic holding to account, of looking inward, deserves a commensurate, totalizing event that explains what is being reckoned with, demanded and hoped for, an experience that rubs between its fingers the earth upon which all those toppled monuments had so brazenly stood. The Moment warrants a depth of conversation the United States has never had. It demands truth and reconciliation.
Other countries have undergone such commissions, tribunals and soul searching — among them, El Salvador, Rwanda, Peru, Germany, South Africa. They recount staggering atrocity: inconceivable corruption, organized oppression, genocide. Of their participants, they compel confession and vulnerability. Of their audience, they require fortitude, a pillow to wail into, a strong stomach.
This country has flirted with truth and reconciliation. Reconstruction ended in 1877, a dozen years after the end of the Civil War. It was more political action than ritual, a campaign of personhood and rights that ended when racists intimidated it out of existence. In 1968, in the wake of the racial conflagrations roiling U.S. cities during the mid- to late 1960s, Gov. Otto Kerner Jr. of Illinois presented the findings of his so-called riot commission, whose politically moderate and racially uniform makeup (two of its members were Black; there was one woman) was strategically cast for ho-hum results. What it delivered to President Lyndon B. Johnson was, instead, shockingly, comprehensively grim. The United States, the commission concluded, is a hopelessly divided nation that has locked its Black citizens in impoverishment and swallowed the key, that good white folks were out to lunch and therefore as culpable as the white supremacists were malignant.
The conclusions and recommendations were urgent, vast yet granular, attentive and astringent. The report deduced that, among other things, the roots of the violence demanded massive housing and police reform, a serious political and economic commitment to social programs, and higher taxes. But nothing meaningful came of it. The conclusions were too overwhelming — too indicting. Johnson seemed to take the findings personally. Plus, the money required to confront them was being spent to prolong the fight in Vietnam. So white America went the opposite direction, electing Richard Nixon, who ran, in part, on a law-and-order campaign. The wound festered.
When it was published as a book early in ’68, the report became a bestseller. But it ought to have been part of a one-two punch. Part two should have been a televised, multipart presentation of the commission’s intensive effort — its conclusions, considerable field work and still-bracing historical contextualizing put before the public alongside the disgruntled, despondent, enraged, hurt Black Americans whose circumstances swell the report. The country watched the cities burn but never met the humans who lived in them. It didn’t spend days on end hearing Kerner and especially, perhaps, John V. Lindsay, the mayor of New York and the commission’s most popular member, inveighing against the racism in our marrow. Johnson and Nixon were essentially able to look the other way.
The nation had become consumed with news of the war. But there was evident hunger to know more about the terrors at home. Nine years after the Kerner Report, a century after Reconstruction’s abandonment, we got “Roots” — eight nights of generational magnum opus meant to inspire as much as explain. It was far from the Kerner Report, set in Gambia and the antebellum South, during the Civil War and its aftermath.
ABC aired “Roots” on consecutive nights as a hedge; the network, home of “Happy Days,” had expected a dud, despite the Alex Haley novel it was based on being a huge hit. The year before, during the bicentennial, NBC had a ratings smash with the network television debut of “Gone With the Wind.” “Roots” wasn’t perfumed with nostalgia. It was, for 1977, a watershed retrospective in which a Black family was the hero, and the dads from some of the U.S.’ favorite shows — “The Brady Bunch,” “The Waltons,” “Bonanza” — played racists. Scores of millions of people beheld its 12 or so hours; the finale on ABC remains the third highest-rated television episode ever. Which is to say that we once were ready to go through something ugly together as a nation.
Neither the times nor the climes are, of course, what they were in ’77. For one thing, most of the country watched that series because there wasn’t much else on. A truth and reconciliation event in 2020 would help make up for 150 years of missed opportunities. It should be broadcast live and streamed the way impeachments and inaugurations are, the way certain trials are. That would require more than just ABC’s audacity, however backhanded. It would need CBS’, NBC’s and Fox’s; CNN’s, BET’s and the Weather Channel’s. It would demand the platforms of Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Hulu and Amazon. There would be no escaping this thing, since there is no escape in the daily lives of many Americans. We’ve marched for systemic reform. This event — some of it recorded, some broadcast live — would tell the horror story of the system, draw straight lines from slavery to right now and demand the system be reformed.
In South Africa, in 1996, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission arose from an agreement to grant amnesty to those who confessed to crimes against humanity committed during more than four decades of apartheid. The commission took statements from 22,000 victims and witnesses, thousands of people applied for amnesty, and a kind of extralegal trial ensued in which the perpetrators faced their victims.
Some of the hearings were broadcast on Sundays for two years in hourlong episodes; and some, on very few occasions, were live. Initially, the government resisted televising them at all but relented to international pressure. Deborah Hoffman and Frances Reid made a haunting documentary of the proceedings, focused on a few cases. Released in 2000, it’s called “Long Night’s Journey Into Day,” and in it, you can see why such an event would be difficult for live production. The hearings were unpredictable and thorny. Not everyone looking for amnesty was necessarily contrite. Racial exorcism proved elusive.
What would an American version be? Court, theater, a hearing, a telethon, therapy, TV, church, Ken Burns, Anna Deavere Smith? Each, perhaps — and more. Who would make it? I don’t know. It could certainly proceed in conjunction with the minds and imaginations of the staff within the Smithsonian brain trust and Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative. Who has been keeping C-SPAN going all these many decades? The production, however, is merely the second hurdle to clear. The first would be convincing executives that it’s worth doing in the first place. Here’s what to say about that: The entertainment industry itself has more than a century of harm to atone for and ameliorate. Any company that believes the solution to “systemic racism” is “The Help” shouldn’t mind a surrender of its airwaves.
Should this event be night after night of that scene in “Hidden Figures” in which Taraji P. Henson unloads on a giant room full of white men, including Kevin Costner, that she’s always late because her colored bathroom is a mile away from her desk ? No. This wouldn’t be an exercise in rage, self-pity or despair — not purely, although the terrain will, by necessity, be despairing. It wouldn’t be a series of “white fragility” lectures, either. What’s needed is a broadcast that could include white Americans awakening to racism but remains focused on the legacies of the racism itself. There might be some of the emotional individual confrontation that put so many South Africans through the wringer. The U.S. version would dare to hold the country to account and atone.
Would that then mean the duty for reconciliation resides with the government? Would the commission just be Congress? I hope not; it should entail more than elected officials. A mandate for the event would come as much from the public as from Washington. The power of Kerner’s outfit was that it went out and heard people.
There’s a blueprint for what I’m proposing, and it’s basically sitting in a vault. House Bill HR 40, as it’s now called, was originally introduced by John Conyers in 1989. He brought it up repeatedly until he left Congress in 2017. The Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans currently rests in the hands of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. What Conyers, who died in 2019, was asking the bill to do seems perfectly reasonable — “address the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the 13 American colonies between 1619 and 1865 and to establish a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery.”
Why not start with that? The bill is simply calling for a conversation about reparations. It doesn’t demand a dollar be paid and only insinuates that money is owed. Instead, it simply wants members of Congress to talk about what it would mean for the U.S. government to close a wealth gap that it opened and, over centuries, widened until inequality among the races appears irreconcilable. If Congress refuses to take it up, Hollywood should adapt it.
The white people who bought, owned, traded, lashed and raped Black people are long dead. Their descendants are among us. Slavery, however, wouldn’t be the subject of this televised reckoning. Racism would. A crucial chunk of a truth and reconciliation broadcast would use the work of scholars and thinkers like Matthew Desmond, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Isabel Wilkerson and Richard Rothstein to enumerate the means by which the country has prospered from the theft of land and the strategic denial of housing.
It’s both a logical framing and a literary one. A home is a transferable asset. It is a refuge, a nest, a beacon of welcome, a source of dignity, the most basic of needs — and for many people over many too many decades, outrageously elusive. “What white Americans have never fully understood, but what the Negro can never forget,” the Kerner Report concluded back in 1968, “is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.”
Weeks could be spent covering housing with, among other things, a series of documentaries that highlight the many government and government-backed programs designed to strengthen segregation and bolster so-called ghettos. You could spend an entire night with the story of Clyde Ross, the Chicago laborer who wound up as a housing rights activist and whose travails Coates built his argument around in “The Case for Reparations.”
Weeks more could be spent on law enforcement, telling the story of the U.S. police force, its roots in enslavement and how racism now seems so inextricable from policing that calls for its abolition have migrated from the ideological fringes. Enough police officers, lawyers, families of the dead, legal scholars and people who are currently and formerly incarcerated could testify to racism’s criminal-justice puppetry. The same goes for the ways in which nonwhite people are far likelier to live amid pollution than white Americans and the deep, unbreakable hypocrisies that continue to keep Black children learning separately and in substandard conditions.
There must be room for the testimony of young Black people whom nobody’s heard of — folks whose hopelessness and alienation, whose fragile personal ambitions and self-belief, can be traced from here back to the 1980s and the 1960s, back to the disillusionments of the late 1870s after the government foreclosed Reconstruction. They are my cousins, my neighbors, my pals. They’re between almost every line of the Kerner Report. And no one is listening to them now.
This reckoning event would in part entail stories of the ways in which the poison of racism has ruined lives and wrecked families, like the Rushes of Lowndes County, a sparsely populated, desperately poor patch of central Alabama. Two years ago, during a congressional hearing, Pamela Sue Rush discussed the devastating squalor to which she’d been relegated for most of her life. Rush was enlisted to become an activist against her own poverty and poor health care options. In July, she died of COVID-19. She was 50.
The country deserves to hear her family discuss her underlying conditions and how they took hold on the land of the former slave quarters that held her mobile home. Residents of Lowndes could inform the country of their lack of access to plumbing or basic sanitation services, about their shouldering of a disproportionate share of this pandemic. The Rosses could stand before the country and tell of Clyde’s losses, fights and gains. Then we’d hear from the officials and schemers who neglected and bilked them. Their confessors would be the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Terry Gross, Katie Couric, Trevor Noah, Brian Lehrer, Cheryl Strayed and Connie Chung, people who excel at listening, people whom Americans are used to listening to, people whose ears seem connected directly to their hearts. The listening feels important. So does the facilitation of dialogue. This makes someone like Winfrey critical to the undertaking. She is a pioneer of televised reckoning and remains a master facilitator.
In June, in the midst of the protests, Winfrey held a two-night, existential video conference call that included Hannah-Jones; Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms; and an anti-poverty activist, the Rev. William Barber II. Titled “Where Do We Go From Here?” it made for a snapshot of a potential commission. For Apple TV+, Winfrey has just begun holding conversations about our times with thought leaders and others. She was made for The Moment. “The Oprah Winfrey Show” was a 25-year truth and reconciliation commission.
Over a series of weeks, the scope would zoom out and contract, telling stories about the country in order to place the lives of individuals in a national context. We’ve grown used to television that’s both expansionist and screen-pinching, macrocosmic and personal: “The Wire,” “Hamilton,” “O.J.: Made in America” and the Michael Jordan documentary “The Last Dance.” We’ve devoured “Star Trek,” “Star Wars,” “Game of Thrones,” “Harry Potter,” the Boston Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs, and 70 years of soap operas. Sagas are a food group. Obviously, barriers exist to wanting and understanding this one. We think we know it. We don’t think we need to know it. “I have a Black friend.” “I saw Ken Burns’ ‘The Civil War.’” “Obama.”
Every title on that list is, in its way, an entertainment — and so, perhaps, is this event. It should be a spectacle. It shouldn’t be spectacular. Maybe some nights ought to feature gospel choirs and tribal groups, music by Kendrick Lamar, Lila Downs, Pamyua, Gladys Knight and Rhiannon Giddens. Maybe every installment should simply feature the lustrous power of Bernice Johnson Reagon, Rutha Mae Harris and Bettie Mae Fikes, the voices of the civil rights movement. Fikes is “the Voice of Selma” and the most important living American singer without a Wikipedia entry. She vowed that the singing she did at John Lewis’ funeral would be her last. Someone should beg her to reconsider.
Entertainment, here, would be a sobering virtue, catharsis rather than a loophole. There would be serious room made for spiritual address and cosmic redress; for acknowledgments of country and native land stewardship; for many nights of Native Americans reinserting themselves in the nation’s narrative, troubling it, setting it right; for breath work and silence that assist us through the heft of this undertaking. There should be readings and dancing and photography and bands and orchestras. There would be a place, as well, for comedy, some of which would arise on its own, some of which might necessitate actual comedians. Laughter helps.
There is no shame in entertainment intended to restore, heal, repair, reveal, reframe, to midwife. A belief in that aspect of entertainment is what once brought historic droves of us to “Roots.” We just didn’t know what to do once it was over. That finale ends with its formerly enslaved family standing atop the hills of Lauderdale County, Tennessee, as if it were the beginning of “The Sound of Music.”
Feels like a comfort now. But in 1977, the predominant response was a deep sigh. The Center for Policy Research polled 500 Black Americans and 500 white Americans and found that many people were saddened by “Roots.” It was a Moment that ultimately withered.
This Moment didn’t come cheaply. It should not be squandered. It should be nationally witnessed and absorbed. Truth and reconciliation is a death and a birth, accordingly arduous, tense, procedural, affirming, painful. The outcome feels secondary to the process. The ritual is the benefit. The Moment demands that we summon the courage to put ourselves through it. At last.

TIVOLI, N.Y. — This summer, as stages around the country lie empty and unused, Kaatsbaan will be something precious and rare: one of the few places in America where dancers will be performing live, in person, in front of a living and breathing, if well-distanced and masked audience.
From Saturday through Sept. 27, Kaatsbaan is planning an outdoor dance festival — the first festival in its 30-year history. Performances will take place on weekends on an outdoor stage in the middle of a field, built from scratch over the past few weeks.
Kaatsbaan’s bucolic expanse of forests and fields along the Hudson River — it was originally a farm belonging to Eleanor Roosevelt’s grandparents — has been a haven for dance since 1990. It has airy studios surrounded by trees and a small theater devoted to training, workshops and creative residencies.
The festival, a response to the depressing lack of performance opportunities facing American dancers, is the brainchild of Stella Abrera, the center’s artistic director of less than a year, and Sonja Kostich, executive director since 2018. As spring approached, Abrera, who retired as a principal dancer from American Ballet Theatre in June, had an idea. “I looked out over the fields,” she said in a recent phone call, “and said to Sonja, can we please build a stage?”
Foremost in her mind, she said, was the knowledge that dancers around the country were sitting idle, even as their colleagues across the Atlantic were beginning to return to work. “It was important to do what we could to get the dance community to a place where they could slowly, safely begin to re-emerge into their performing life, even if it was going be in an unconventional way,” she said.
The national soul-searching touched off by the killing of George Floyd in police custody further intensified the sense of urgency. “How can we not respond to what is happening in our society?” Abrera said. “Art helps us be part of our world, to process what is happening around us, to grieve.”
She and Kostich saw a need, as well as an opportunity. To make the festival inclusive and as responsive to the moment as possible, they invited a trio of distinguished Black dancers to develop the programming with them: Alicia Graf Mack, who also runs the dance department at the Juilliard School in New York; Lloyd Knight, of the Martha Graham Dance Company; and Calvin Royal III, of American Ballet Theatre. Their input influenced all aspects of the festival, from the curation of programs, to the selection of dancers, and the inclusion of new works by Knight, Royal, and others.
“This is a great example of how Black voices don’t have to be siloed,” Graf Mack said. “Their voices can be woven through the work of different artists of various backgrounds. It doesn’t have to only exist within historically Black companies.”
For Royal, who programmed the first evening of the festival and is choreographing and performing in it as well, the chance to re-immerse himself in dance came at just the right moment. The summer has been difficult, he said. A ballet dancer just on the cusp of stardom, he saw several important debuts melt away with the cancellation of Ballet Theater’s spring season. “I’ve been trying to navigate what the future is going to hold,” he said.
Then came the killing of Floyd, and the ugliness it revealed. “The news is so depressing and so negative,” Royal said. “I wanted to really show the beauty that’s out there, honoring Black and brown artists.” His evening includes performances by Courtney Lavine and Melvin Lawovi, colleagues from American Ballet Theatre, and a tap solo by Leonardo Sandoval, accompanied by bassist Greg Richardson; the pair have performed with Michelle Dorrance’s company, Dorrance Dance, and have their own tap ensemble.
In a sense, Kaatsbaan is filling the void left by the larger, more established festivals, which were forced to cancel live performances this year. Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts, the American Dance Festival North Carolina and the Vail Dance Festival in Colorado, all had made the decision to go virtual. Designed to draw dancers and choreographers from around the world, those festivals found themselves stymied by the logistics of travel in a pandemic, and financially unable to radically downsize.
Unlike European festivals like Salzburg, the Rossini Opera Festival in Italy, and the Festival Internacional de Música y Danza de Granada in Spain — all of which are holding live events this summer — they aren’t backed by state and local governments; they need to preserve their resources in order to survive.
Kaatsbaan, by contrast, has no precedent to live up to. And an advantage of being small is the ability to keep things simple and costs down. “This is a fairly bare bones operation at the moment,” Abrera said. There are just seven employees, including her and the two men building the stage.
“People have been doing things online” Knight said, “but to have an actual festival, where you’re going to see performers live, and it’s going to be done safely, surrounded by so much beautiful nature, is really exciting.”
All the performances will be free, paid for by benefactors and small donations, 25% of which will go to the NAACP and other Black Lives Matter-related organizations. People planning to come must register online ahead of time. (Some of the content will later be shared via Kaatsbaan’s social media as well.)
The rate of new coronavirus infections in the Hudson Valley has remained low since mid-May. On July 7, the area entered Phase 4, allowing museums to reopen for a reduced number of visitors, restaurants to serve a limited number of diners, and gatherings of up to 50 people to take place, with proper distancing. On a recent visit to Tivoli, the few people milling around downtown wore masks. The vibe was respectful and relaxed.
Back in May institutions like the sculpture park Opus 40 and the performing arts center PS 21 began to make plans to reopen and host a few small-scale performances. This, too, encouraged the Kaatsbaan team to move forward, Kostich said.
Kaatsbaan also has the advantage of being self-contained, with studios, living areas and the newly built stage, all on site. And of being only two hours from New York City, home to a large number of dancers, who can travel there with relative ease and safety. The dancers will drive up after quarantining for 14 days, during which time they will take two coronavirus tests. They will stay secluded on the property in the days preceding each week’s performances.
Programs will be kept short, between 20 minutes and a half-hour, and audiences small, with no more than 50 people viewing from benches (or from cars). As Abrera pointed out, that brevity will reduce the number of audience members needing bathroom breaks (they’re hoping for very few) and discourage people from traveling long distances to attend.
The idea is to keep things local — the festival grounds are right off Tivoli’s main street — and low-key. “We wanted to provide something for this amazing community where we are located,” Kostich said, “from whom we’ve received overwhelming support and encouragement.”
That communitarian sentiment was echoed by Joel Griffith, the mayor of Tivoli, who is also a painter. “Dancers are going to dance, painters are going to paint and restaurants are going to serve food,” he said in a phone conversation. “That’s the human spirit. You just have to blend it all with the necessary discipline.”
The programs, made up mostly of solos and socially distanced duets, will be refreshingly eclectic, ranging from ballet to flamenco to tap to Broadway to postmodern dance. (Only people who live together will be allowed to touch onstage.) There will be new works by Royal and Knight, as well as by the postmodernist Jodi Melnick, the tapper Caleb Teicher, and Emily Kikta and Peter Walker of New York City Ballet.
Anchoring it all will be a light and sound installation, a meditation on police violence and the disproportionate effect of the coronavirus on minority groups. “In light: of the time” contains images projected onto the ceiling of a barn near the property’s entrance designed in 1895 by Stanford White’s firm. The public will walk through on its way to the benches.
The artist behind the project is Brandon Stirling Baker, a lighting designer who is working as part of a collective that includes Jamar Roberts and Hope Boykin of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the poet and playwright Carl Hancock Rux, and the lighting designer Alan C. Edwards. Boykin and Rux have written text, while Roberts, who has a background in visual art, provided drawings.
“Generally I’m a hopeful person,” Roberts said in a phone call, “but at this moment I just don’t know how I feel. If you allow yourself to really take in what’s happening, it’s all sad. All of it. In every way.”
The gravity of the moment is lost on no one. It seems to animate the festival, providing the organizers with the drive to push forward, despite the complications of organizing a festival in a time of great anxiety. As well as a certain humility before the enormity of events. “I just hope,” said Kostich, “that we can provide a fleeting moment of relief or joy. We’re just trying to do our job as best we can.”

Hong Kong Is Keeping Pro-Democracy Candidates Out of Its Election [With graphic(s)]

HONG KONG — Weeks after the Chinese government imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong, raising fears of a broader crackdown on the semiautonomous territory, the city’s authorities have taken aggressive steps against the pro-democracy opposition.
Officials on Thursday barred 12 candidates, including well-known pro-democracy figures, from the September legislative election. The disqualifications came a day after the police made what appeared to be the first targeted arrests of four activists accused of posting pro-independence messages online.
Local news outlets also reported that the government was considering postponing the election by as much as a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, though pro-democracy lawmakers argued it would be a naked attempt to avoid a loss at the polls.
Opposition candidates said they had hoped to ride a wave of protests and public discontent to electoral success on Sept. 6. But they had also acknowledged the fear that the government would disqualify candidates on the nebulous grounds that they would not uphold the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Constitution.
The candidates who said they were barred included Joshua Wong, a prominent activist, and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist, both of them front-runners in an unofficial democratic primary this month. The list also includes four sitting lawmakers, including members of the moderate, pro-democracy Civic Party.
Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong said it supported the disqualifications. The Hong Kong government said more could follow.
It also said in a statement that grounds for disqualification included advocating Hong Kong’s independence or self-determination, soliciting intervention from foreign governments, expressing an objection in principle to the national security law Beijing imposed last month, or vowing to indiscriminately vote against government proposals.
“The excuse they use is that I describe national security law as a draconian law, which shows that I do not support this sweeping law,” Wong, 23, wrote on Facebook. “Clearly, Beijing shows a total disregard for the will of the Hongkongers, tramples upon the city’s last pillar of vanishing autonomy and attempts to keep Hong Kong’s legislature under its firm grip.”
Disqualification letters sent to the pro-democracy lawmakers Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok and Kenneth Leung said their calls for the U.S. to impose sanctions on those responsible for rights abuses in Hong Kong would violate the national security law.
Yeung and Kwok said in their reply that their visit to New York last August and a joint letter they sent in September to U.S. senators took place months before the national security law took effect.
Though the security law could not be applied retroactively, election officers said candidates’ past actions and remarks reflected their true intentions.
Yeung’s disqualification letter also accused him of planning, along with other members of the Civic Party, to “indiscriminately vote down” government proposals. Under the Basic Law, the chief executive must call for a new legislative election if the government cannot pass a budget. If it happens again under a new legislature, the chief executive must step down.
Eric Cheung, a law lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said he believed lawmakers had the constitutional right to block government proposals and compel the leader to step down. He said the mass disqualifications showed that Hong Kong was growing increasingly similar to mainland China.
“According to the legal system in the mainland, one cannot openly oppose the regime, which is considered to be beyond the limits of free speech,” he said. “Only allowing certain people they find acceptable to run isn’t a free election — it’s what totalitarian governments do.”
The disqualifications came on the heels of the arrests of four people accused of publishing social media posts that called for the city to become independent from China. The sweep on Wednesday was an early indication that authorities would strictly enforce the new law and crack down on speech that was now considered illegal.
The police said the activists, three men and one woman whose ages range from 16 to 21, were arrested in the New Territories area of Hong Kong for the “publishing of content about secession, and inciting or abetting others for the commission of secession.” Officers seized mobile phones, computers and documents during the roundup.
Li Kwai-wah, a senior superintendent of the Hong Kong police’s new national security department, said the arrests had been made after an organization posted on social media about creating a new party to promote Hong Kong independence. Its “declarations” referred to establishing a “Hong Kong country” and using “all means” to achieve its goals, Li said.
Li gave no further information about the organization or about the four people arrested. He said the comments had been posted after the security law took effect, but he would not say whether they had been taken down or elaborate further on their content.
A political organization called Studentlocalism said its former convener, Tony Chung, was among those arrested. When the national security law took effect, the group said it had ended its operations in Hong Kong but that some members would continue to work overseas.
The legislation came into force a month ago and gives the Chinese government broad new powers over the semiautonomous territory. The new law targets subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers, and many of its clauses indicate they were written to curb the protests. For a city that had generally had strong protections for free speech, the legislation represented a drastic shift.
The law had already been cited in the arrests of about a dozen people during several demonstrations, including on July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control. Human rights groups denounced those street arrests, saying they showed that the authorities intended to use the new powers to clamp down on peaceful activities. The Wednesday arrests, rights groups said, sent another chilling message and raised concerns about a crackdown on activism and political speech in Hong Kong.
“The gross misuse of this draconian law makes clear that the aim is to silence dissent, not protect national security,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch.
Under the new law, Chinese security agencies can now operate openly in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong police said the arrests had been carried out by its own national security department.
Beijing imposed the security law after more than a year of large protests in Hong Kong, many of which involved violent clashes with the police. The protests were set off by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China from Hong Kong, which is guaranteed its own legal system under the terms of the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule in 1997.
The demonstrations evolved to encompass a range of issues, including the police’s use of force and calls for expanding direct elections.
This month, more than 600,000 people participated in a primary for the pro-democracy camp despite warnings from the government that it was possibly illegal. That show of support followed a landslide win for opposition candidates in district council elections in November.

Officials in Louisville, Kentucky, where there have been continuing protests over the police killing of Breonna Taylor and where coronavirus cases have begun to rise, said Wednesday that the city might join a growing list of local governments that have declared racism a public health crisis.
Local officials in 19 states — including California, Connecticut, Georgia, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin — have passed or are considering similar resolutions, according to the American Public Health Association.
“We must have a new sense of urgency to make this declaration and do the hard work of dismantling racism and creating real transformation,” Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “I look forward to partnering with Council on this work of declaring racism as a public health emergency.”
How exactly Louisville makes its declaration is still being negotiated, one health official said. It could be made through a resolution or ordinance passed by the Louisville Metro Council or through an executive order from the mayor.
Once declared, it could help establish funding priorities and possibly lead to regular reports on how local government officials are addressing racial inequality, according to T. Benicio Gonzales, director of the Center for Health Equity at the Louisville health department.
If racism is identified as a public health emergency, then local lawmakers could say to the heads of city agencies, “What are you doing in order to address this important health issue?” Gonzales said in an interview.
Gonzales said the declaration could provide “an opportunity to be explicit about what are the causes and barriers to good health.”
Earlier Wednesday, officials at a Louisville Metro Council meeting said health and income disparities fell disproportionately along racial lines in the city.
Kendall Boyd, chief equity officer for the mayor’s office, presented a report at the hearing that found Black residents of the city were 2.6 times more likely to be arrested by police than white residents.
The report also found that in 2016, the unemployment rate among Black residents was 11%, compared with 5% for white residents; and the mortality rate for Black infants was 2.5 times higher than for white babies from 2011 through 2015.
“When someone doesn’t look at racism and equity every day like I do, it can be hard to connect those dots,” Boyd said. “So that’s why if we declare racism and racist attitudes and racist structures as part of this overall public health crisis, we can see how racism literally can kill people.”
Boyd said that the coronavirus pandemic and the recent protests for racial justice sparked by police killings of Black people — including Taylor in Louisville and George Floyd in Minneapolis — had given these centuries-old problems new urgency.
Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was shot and killed March 13 by Louisville police officers who entered her home using a battering ram while executing a search warrant. Police have said that they returned fire when Taylor’s boyfriend shot an officer in the leg. Several investigations into Taylor’s killing are underway.
One Louisville officer was terminated in June; two other officers have been placed on administrative reassignment.
On Wednesday, the mayor wrote on Twitter that he shared “the frustration at the pace of justice as we all await” the results of the investigations into Taylor’s killing.
Some residents on social media criticized the proposed declaration, responding to the mayor’s tweet and Facebook post about the news with calls to bring justice for Taylor’s family. Other residents saw the move as a distraction.
Tim Wohlford, a Louisville resident, said the declaration was a symbolic move by the mayor, rather than a substantive one.
“Everybody was yelling at him for six years to do something about the police,” Wohlford, 58, said.
“Racism is an all-encompassing term,” he said, and it was unfair to expect health officials to address such a wide-ranging problem. “No way in hell. They don’t have the funding or the expertise.”
Since the beginning of July, the coronavirus has continued to spread throughout Kentucky, according to a New York Times database. The seven-day average of new cases at the beginning of the month was 227. By Tuesday, that figure was 605.
In Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, there are 854 cases per 100,000 people, above the statewide total of 660 cases per 100,000.
According to Boyd, Black residents are 23% of the city’s population but account for about 27% of coronavirus-related deaths.
Moving forward, Boyd said funding was needed to address racism as a health crisis.
“Just putting something on paper and declaring it a public health crisis is one thing,” Boyd said. “There has to be a specific intentionality and commitment of resources addressing this as a public health crisis.”

The Black Book Club Takes It to the Next Level [With graphic(s)]

“I want people to think radically,” said Noname, the 28-year-old rapper, in a phone interview this month from her home in Los Angeles. She is outspoken, especially on Twitter, about dismantling patriarchy, white supremacy and capitalism, but over the last year she has also been opening people’s minds through a more analog medium.
It started in July 2019, when she posted a photo of “Jackson Rising: The Struggle for Economic Democracy and Black Self-Determination in Jackson, Mississippi,” a collection of essays about the movement to develop cooperative economic practices in the capital of America’s poorest state. Later, another Twitter user replied with a photo of the book and suggested that they become “pen pals and swap notes.”
Thus began the Noname Book Club, a reading group focused on texts by authors of color (tagline: “reading material for the homies”). Hers is one of many Black- and women-led book clubs people are turning to in the midst of a virus that has alienated people from their communities and a continuing global conversation about anti-Black racism.
What is essential to each of these groups — and why members find them appealing — has a lot to do with leaders creating a space free of the white gaze.
Black Book Clubs Then and Now
The Black book club has, over time, served as a space of critical study, leisure and fellowship. In the 19th century, free Black Americans in the North saw literary societies and the organized literary activities that they sponsored “as one way to arrest the attention of the public, assert their racial and American identities, and give voice to their belief in the promises of democracy,” Elizabeth McHenry wrote in “Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies.”
McHenry also notes in her book that “not every member of African American literary societies wanted to be a writer or enjoyed unmediated relationship with texts.” Some members weren’t even literate, so they relied on others to share information.
At the end of the 20th century, the Black-led book club became a national phenomenon and a commercial success. Oprah’s Book Club, founded by Oprah Winfrey in 1996, introduced readers to Black authors including Toni Morrison and Pearl Cleage in the 1990s and early aughts. Winfrey helped bring Black literature to non-Black consumers and created a blueprint for celebrities of all stripes to become literary tastemakers.
Of course, many of Oprah’s readers — and the authors she has recommended to them — have been white.
The protests following the killings of George Floyd, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor and countless others have led many people, most of them white, to immerse themselves in books about race in America, like the bestselling titles “How to Be an Antiracist,” by Ibram X. Kendi, and “White Fragility,” by Robin DiAngelo.
At Good Books Atlanta, a pop-up and online bookstore owned by Katie Mitchell and her mother, Katherine, recent purchasing trends reflect non-Black customers’ desire to better understand race and whiteness.
“I’ve definitely seen a surge in demand for anti-racist reading, nonfiction that really exposes systemic racism,” Mitchell said. Those books are usually purchased by newer customers.
The Radicalization of Noname
Since its founding in August 2019, Noname’s book club has grown to nearly 10,000 Patreon subscribers, who pay at least $1 a month for membership. Others follow her book recommendations on Twitter and support the club by buying merchandise.
Though her mother, Desiree Sanders, owned a bookstore in Chicago, Noname did not necessarily inherit her bookish tendencies.
“I wasn’t really interested in reading,” she said of her grade-school years. And even now, “I’m pretty insecure about it. I’m just doing it now because I think it’s important, and I do love language and literature.”
Her more recent interest in reading was born out of the formation of her politics. “I’m still doing the reading, learning,” she said. She supports abolition — “of the U.S. empire,” she said, but especially the police, an idea that has gained broader support in recent months. Activists have pushed for local policing budgets to be redirected toward social and mental health services.
She posts about many of these ideas on Twitter, where she is the recipient of much adoration and vitriol.
“Anything that’s going to be pro-liberation, I’ll always tweet that without hesitation,” she said. “I think when you start questioning systems, it helps you to open up other parts of your humanity.”
Her work expands to other forms of social activism, including sending literature to incarcerated people. The future of her book club includes plans to start a grocery drive and provide cooked meals for the homeless in Los Angeles, where she lives.
“The Free Reading Program,” which she plans to start once she reaches 10,000 subscribers, will focus on one essay a month and will be facilitated by organizers and educators, according to the book club’s Patreon page. The program is specifically focused on political education, and will focus on themes like Marxism and feminism.
“We read books, but under the umbrella that I am continuously trying to expand different initiatives through book club,” she said.
Black Book Clubs Everywhere
The vlogger known as Jouelzy, who founded the book club Smart Brown Girl, believes there is a privilege associated with selecting and interpreting texts, so the space she has created is an attempt to remedy that.
“We have a cohort of Black women graduate-level researchers who produce what we call syllabi that walk you through the readings we’re doing to make the books more accessible,” she said. Those materials include background on each author, a book overview, themes and motifs, reading tips, discussion questions and suggestions of similar books to read next.
Expanding the kinds of Black stories that are centered is what prompted K Bailey Obazee, 30, to start OKHA, a book club in London that she describes as “hella Black and hella gay.” (“Okha” means “tale” in Edo, the language spoken in the state in Nigeria where she is from.)
Obazee grew tired of seeing the same Black authors promoted over and over again. “We kind of try and make sure that you are reading books, not just by the same people and not just by people who are well known,” she said.
Beyond the texts that are discussed, physical space is also key, particularly for Obazee’s largely queer membership (though the pandemic has put in-person meetings on hold).
“It’s nice to create a safe space, somewhere that can primarily be a sober space, particularly for those who don’t drink, for those who don’t want to party but still want to engage and connect with their community,” Obazee said.
The club serves as an exhibition as well, where Black and queer artists’ work is on display.
“That’s an opportunity for people who come to the book club to also become accustomed to the other forms of storytelling,” she said, “because it’s not just written. We tell stories in varying mediums.”
There are chapters of the Well-Read Black Girl book club, founded by Glory Edim, 36, in independent bookstores across all 50 states, thanks to a partnership with the American Booksellers Association. The clubs are self-directed but follow the same book recommendations, which include one monthly title for adults and one for Young Adult readers.
The book club also holds an annual festival, now in its fourth year. Past participants have included the novelist Jacqueline Woodson and the poets Aja Monet and Staceyann Chin.
“Last year our theme was reading as resistance, and it being a kind of radical act,” Edim said. This year’s event, which does not yet have a date, will be virtual, but its ambition is just as huge: “Trying to find ways to just have a really positive impact and move towards the Black liberation,” she said.

Trump Plays on Racist Fears of Terrorized Suburbs to Court White Voters [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump vowed Wednesday to protect suburbanites from low-income housing being built in their neighborhoods, making an appeal to white suburban voters by trying to stir up racist fears about affordable housing and the people who live there.
In a tweet and later in remarks during a visit to Texas, Trump painted a false picture of the suburbs as under siege and ravaged by crime, using fearmongering language that has become something of a rhetorical flourish in his general election campaign against the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
Trump said on Twitter that “people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream” would “no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood.” The president was referring to the administration’s decision last week to roll back an Obama-era program intended to combat racial segregation in suburban housing. The program expanded provisions in the Fair Housing Act to encourage diversification and “foster inclusive communities.”
“Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down,” he wrote, even though there was no evidence that the program led to an increase in crime.
The tweet, sent from aboard Air Force One as Trump traveled to Texas, was the latest example of the president stoking racial division as he seeks to win over voters in his bid for reelection. White suburban voters, particularly women, were key to his victory in 2016 but are slipping away from him.
The remarks also came just days after aides had convinced the president that his best reelection strategy was to demonstrate that he was focused on a comprehensive response to the surging coronavirus pandemic. In recent weeks, as the president’s poll numbers have tumbled, some of his advisers have told Trump to try to convince a skeptical nation that he has been effective in managing the virus crisis and is taking it seriously.
Last week, Trump resuscitated the White House briefings focused on the pandemic, keeping them shorter and more focused than the ones he conducted in March, when he often rambled in his comments, sparred with the news media and engaged in fanciful speculation, including that injecting disinfectant into the human body could help fend off the virus.
He also changed his stance on face masks, calling it “patriotic” to wear one and even appearing in public with one on. On Monday, Trump promoted what he claimed was quick progress on a vaccine during a trip to North Carolina to visit a plant working on one.
But since he took office, Trump’s presidency has unfolded along two tracks: the scripted one, which he sticks to for hours or sometimes days at a time, and the one guided by his own instincts, often revealed on Twitter. Trump has been more eager to talk about culture wars and draw attention to images of unrest on the streets of cities led by Democratic politicians than to stay focused on the virus.
And his tweet Wednesday was further evidence that he inevitably reverts to his instinct to play to his base when campaigning under pressure.
During his remarks in West Texas later Wednesday, Trump bragged again that he had ended a government program that tries to reduce segregation in suburban areas.
“People fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home,” he said. “There will be no more low-income housing forced into the suburbs.
“It’s been hell for suburbia,” he added, before telling the audience to “enjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen.”
Trump has also invoked the suburbs to try to increase apprehension about Biden. Last week he provocatively tweeted directly to “the Suburban Housewives of America,” warning, “Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream.”
Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden, the former vice president, accused Trump of trying to further divide the country.
“Instead of finally leading, Donald Trump is yet again attempting to distract from his catastrophic failed response to the pandemic by trying to divide our nation,” Bates said. “Turning Americans against each other with total lies is unacceptable for a commander-in-chief at any time, but it’s especially heinous to do so in a moment of worsening crisis.”
The Biden campaign said that as president, Biden would reinstate the program expanding provisions in the Fair Housing Act.
Trump and his father, Fred Trump, were sued by the Justice Department in the 1970s for their company’s practice of discriminating against Black tenants.
Trump’s view of the makeup of the American suburbs also appears to be frozen in time. In 2018, support from suburban voters helped Democrats retake the House of Representatives. The following year, they helped Democrats win governorships in reliably red states like Kentucky and Louisiana.
Trump’s support among women and among independent voters has suffered as he has repeatedly made divisive entreaties based on race or retweeted inflammatory Twitter posts. His mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic has also contributed to his falloff in the polls.
Earlier this year, the Trump campaign poured tens of millions of dollars into television commercials highlighting the administration’s focus on criminal justice reform, which was as much an attempt to convince white suburban voters that the president was not racist as it was to expand Trump’s appeal among voters of color.
Since then, however, Trump’s own rhetoric and the actions of his administration appear to have undone any inroads those advertisements may have made. He has demonized protesters in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in the custody of white police officers. Vice President Mike Pence has refused to say “Black Lives Matter,” insisting in an interview that “all life matters, born and unborn.”
Trump has said that Black Lives Matter is a “symbol of hate,” despite the fact that a majority of voters support the protests that have taken place nationally.
The president also has openly defended the Confederate flag, scolding NASCAR when it banned it from its races, and he has tried to conflate peaceful protesters with a smaller group who have more aggressively sought to tear down statues of Confederate generals.
Jef Pollock, a Democratic pollster, said that Trump is recycling a political playbook from an era that’s long gone.
“Trump is playing old New York politics from the 1990s,” Pollock said. “The reality is that more and more suburban voters have embraced diversity as a positive thing for their community. They support the Black Lives Matter movement, and from an aspirational perspective, they want their children to grow up in a more tolerant and less divided country. What’s scary to them is the constant division and intolerance that Trump is promulgating.”

NEW YORK — The Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the Bronx Zoo, three other zoos and an aquarium in New York, apologized Wednesday for two aspects of its history that the society’s chief executive described as demonstrating “unconscionable racial intolerance.”
In a statement, the society apologized for an incident that took place in 1906 when the Bronx Zoo put a young Central African man of the Mbuti ethnic group on display in the Monkey House for several days.
Objections from local Black ministers ultimately put a stop to the exploitative exhibition.
The conservation society, which was established as the New York Zoological Society in 1895, had never before issued a formal public apology for the inhumane treatment of the young man, Ota Benga, who had previously been taken from his home in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo and put on display at the St. Louis World’s Fair.
The second part of the apology addressed two of the group’s founders — Madison Grant and Henry Fairfield Osborn — and their advancement of “eugenics-based, pseudoscientific racism.”
The chief executive of the conservation society, Cristián Samper, said in an interview that the group had started digging into its history because of its 125th anniversary this year and that that process — combined with conversations about racial injustice sweeping the country after the police killing of George Floyd — led the organization to publish the apology.
Samper said that over the years, the organization had heard from both employees and outside observers who wanted the group to directly address the issue of Ota Benga.
“As we looked to the 125th, I kept coming back to this,” Samper said. “We really needed to look at this, to own up to this. It’s a tragic thing that we did.”
In a letter to staff last month, the society announced its plan to acknowledge the mistakes publicly and to make available its digitized archives related to Ota Benga, which it did Wednesday. Among the documents is a letter from the Bronx Zoo director at the time, William Temple Hornaday, to the New York mayor, George McClellan, saying that the Black ministers’ objection to the display of Ota Benga was “notoriety-seeking” and not an attempt to address a “real grievance.”
The letter to staff noted that Ota Benga ultimately took his own life after he was unable to return home because of travel restrictions during World War I, calling him a “victim of the racism that robbed him of his humanity.”
Grant, who helped create the zoological society, was a conservationist and eugenicist who wrote a book called “The Passing of the Great Race.” It argued that America’s greatness, built on the Nordic stock of its founders, was being eroded by immigrants. Adolf Hitler is said to have called the book “my bible.” The book was praised by another of the group’s founders, Osborn, also a noted eugenicist, who for 25 years led the American Museum of Natural History as its president.
“We deeply regret that many people and generations have been hurt by these actions,” Samper wrote in his public statement, “or by our failure previously to publicly condemn and denounce them.”

An Orlando, Florida police officer shoved a 27-year-old Hispanic woman down a flight of stairs, breaking her ankle. A jury ordered him to pay her medical bills.
Another officer slammed an 84-year-old World War II veteran to the ground during a car-towing dispute, resulting in doctors’ putting him into a medically induced coma. The city had to pay him $880,000.
Outside a Target store, officers investigating a robbery surrounded a minivan and fired into it nearly a dozen times, critically injuring an unarmed man. He won a $750,000 settlement.
The episodes all occurred between 2007 and 2010, long before the ongoing protests currently sweeping the country, decrying the disproportionate use of police force against people of color. If the Orlando police felt even a fraction of the pressure that departments face today, the leadership did not bend to it: The chief, Val Demings, defended the officers in each case.
A decade later, Demings, now a second-term Democratic congresswoman, has emerged as a finalist to be Joe Biden’s running mate. She rose in politics as a Black woman with law enforcement credentials, but her moment in the spotlight comes as the nation reckons with the difficult legacy of police brutality and racial discrimination.
If she is chosen as the vice-presidential nominee, her career could prove to be a political asset against an incumbent president who is building his reelection campaign around his call for law and order, while attacking Biden as weak on crime. But in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, it could also be a political liability.
“This is an opportunity to change the way things are,” said David Porter, a former newspaper columnist active in progressive causes, who worked for Demings early in her political career. “I just don’t know that picking a cop would send the right message right now.”
In recent weeks, Demings has become a leading voice calling for changes in policing, and she has cast herself as an experienced reformer, repeating that she started out as a social worker and brought a “social worker’s heart” to police work. But a review by The New York Times shows a more complicated record: that of a police leader with a long history of defending the status quo.
Demings, 63, spent 27 years in one of the most violent police departments of its size in the United States. She repeatedly defended fellow officers, dating at least to 1999, when she helped vindicate a white chief in a neighboring city of allegations of racial discrimination. During her time as chief, crime sharply declined, but police use of force remained high; a 2015 study by The Orlando Sentinel showed that in the second half of Demings’ tenure and during the tenure of her successor, officers used force at a rate that was twice as high as those of officers at other departments of similar size.
In an interview this week, Demings stood by her record on police accountability, saying she improved hiring practices and increased officer training. But she said her top priority as chief was addressing a spike in crime.
“Police work is not a perfect science,” she said. “We’re there to clean up messes. And sometimes when you clean up messes, it’s not pretty.”
Demings rose from humble roots to become Orlando’s first female chief and a House manager in Trump’s impeachment trial this year. Her supporters believe she could appeal to enough independents, and perhaps even Republicans, to improve Biden’s prospects in Florida, a battleground state where major elections are routinely decided by razor-thin margins.
Demings was born Valdez Butler, the youngest of seven children of a maid and a janitor. She grew up in a two-room house outside Jacksonville, Florida, and said growing up she experienced racism and the vestiges of segregation.
After graduating from Florida State University with a degree in criminology, she worked for a year at a security company and then for two years as a counselor to children in foster homes.
In 1983, she heard a radio ad recruiting officers for the Orlando Police Department and decided to apply.
Demings rose through the ranks, serving in nearly every part of the department, including the patrol division, the hostage negotiation team and the public information office, and earning stellar reviews.
Violent crime in Orlando was at a high when Demings became chief in 2007. She responded by focusing on specific neighborhoods and housing complexes, and during her tenure, violent crime fell by 40%.
But her tenure also was marked by repeated allegations of police brutality.
Perhaps the most scrutinized case she faced occurred in 2010, when Officer Travis LaMont, then 26, encountered 84-year-old Daniel Daley arguing with a tow-truck driver outside of a bar.
Daley urged LaMont to help, and he later acknowledged tapping the officer’s arm several times. The officer told him to stop, and when he did not, he performed what is known as a “dynamic takedown,” leaning into Daley with his hip and throwing him to the ground.
Daley landed on his head and broke his neck. Demings defended LaMont, saying, “The officer performed the technique within department guidelines,” although she said she would review the guidelines.
Demings declined to answer written questions about specific cases but said she did her best to hold officers accountable.
“I did what I could, when I could and where I could,” she said in an email.
As protests have swept the nation, Demings has responded carefully. She published an op-ed in The Washington Post entitled, “My fellow brothers and sisters in blue, what the hell are you doing?” But she has declined to say whether the officers who killed Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, should be arrested, as protesters have demanded.
This spring, before the protests began but after impeachment hearings increased her profile, Demings updated her campaign website. Her logo previously read “Chief Val Demings for Congress.” Now it says “Val Demings for Congress.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Still, they come — from all over the country and beyond. From New Mexico, Texas, Massachusetts. From Africa and Europe. One man even said he walked a thousand miles, all the way from Alabama, just to be in Minneapolis.
“They are coming to feel the energy and pay tribute,” said Bianca Dawkins, 28, a local resident who has met many of the visitors.
Two months after the police killing of George Floyd, the four-block area of South Minneapolis where he gasped his last breaths remains a sacred space, a no-go zone for officers. There is a neatly trimmed garden, anchored by a sculpture of a raised fist. There are colorful murals and the words “I can’t breathe” painted across the pavement, as well as the names of dozens of other Black people killed by the police.
At night, though, the space is increasingly a battleground, with shootings and drug overdoses. The area has had an uptick in gun violence similar to what other cities have seen in the wake of protests.
At all times, the neighborhood brims with emotion. In its totality, it feels like the raw center of America’s reckoning with racial injustice.
The chaos at night has presented city officials with the challenge of how to reassert control of the space without setting off new waves of anger, all while maintaining it as a solemn place to honor Floyd. In Ferguson, Missouri, where the police killing of Michael Brown set off protests in 2014, tensions were reignited when officers moved to clear out a memorial.
But in Minneapolis, at least for now, the city is moving cautiously.
“Opening up too quickly will have a devastating effect on people still mourning,” said Angela Conley, a Hennepin County commissioner, who has been leading community discussions about the future of the area where Floyd was killed.
Even so, elected officials are fielding a growing number of calls from residents concerned about the violence and loud noise at night in the area, where, among several incidents, a pregnant woman was recently killed.
“What people aren’t recognizing is that people who live there are having a very, very challenging time from the unlawfulness that is occurring after the sun goes down,” said Andrea Jenkins, a member of the City Council whose district includes the memorial space. “There are constant gunshots every night. Emergency vehicles can’t get in. Disabled people are not able to access their medications, their appointments, their food deliveries, et cetera. It’s a very challenging situation.”
Jenkins, who noted that the area has historically been plagued by gang violence, has also been taking a leading role in discussions over how to memorialize Floyd’s killing. One proposal suggests making the garden permanent. Other ideas include a civil rights museum and renaming Chicago Avenue in honor of Floyd. Activists are finding ways to preserve the street art that was painted over the plywood boards that went up to protect businesses during the protests.
From Baltimore to Ferguson to New York, organic memorials to mark where Black men have been killed by the police have taken shape in recent years.
But time has also worn many of them away. On Staten Island, New York, there is a plaque where Eric Garner was killed by police in 2014, but a memorial with flowers and candles was set on fire a year after his death. In Baltimore, where Freddie Gray’s death in a police van sparked protests, a graffiti mural in honor of him was destroyed when the housing project where he lived was torn down this year. In Ferguson last year, on the fifth anniversary of Brown’s death, a memorial that had been taken down was rebuilt.
Even before the killing of Floyd, Jenkins and other activists in South Minneapolis said they had hoped to build a site to recognize the history of racial injustice in the city. “I’ve been talking about a museum for the last three years,” Jenkins said. “My top priority is to build a center for racial healing in the city of Minneapolis because Black people have been in pain for hundreds of years.”
The conversation over what to do with the space comes as many activists in the city are fighting to defund the Police Department and reimagine public safety. But that push for reform happening amid a rise in violence. Many Black residents of South Minneapolis, especially those who live near Cup Foods, the convenience store where Floyd was accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes before he was killed, say they are caught between two emotions: anger at the police but fearful for their safety now that officers have pulled back from the area.
Dawkins lives a few doors down from Cup Foods, and on a recent afternoon was selling candy and drinks and promoting a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to avoid foreclosure. When the pandemic hit, she was furloughed from her job at Nordstrom, and her fiancé is also out of work.
But financial worries are only one thing on her mind. She has two children, including a 6-week-old baby. She says the daytime is fine, and she has met many people who have traveled to pay their respects to Floyd.
“But when the other crowd comes at night, I can’t call the police, and that scares the hell out of me,” she said. Dawkins pointed to a gunshot in the windshield of her car, a gold sedan.
“We have kids in this home, so I do want police to protect families,” she said. “It’s a hard balance. I’m happy this incident brought change, but I want to feel safe.”
As the protests gained momentum in late May, Dr. Jackie Kawiecki set up a medic station near Cup Foods, administering first aid to injured protesters. Since then, she has maintained a group of medics who treat minor ailments like abrasions and heat exhaustion during the daytime.
Sunset to sunrise is very different from sunrise to sunset, she said. “My nighttime world, after sunset, I have taken care of double gunshot wounds, drug overdoses.” One night a man wounded by gunfire drove a bicycle past the barricades, she said, before collapsing outside her tent and yelling: “I’m shot! I’m shot!”
After the pregnant woman was killed nearby in early July, and having dodged gunfire herself, Kawiecki limited the hours of her medic station from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
But residents say that nothing happening at night diminishes the atmosphere that prevails in daylight. The other day, Anna Raeker, 25, was greeting visitors to the space and directing people to a pamphlet taped to a table: “This is a space community members want to decentralize white feelings and prioritize Black pain.”
“I think it’s important that white people are intentional with the ways they are using this space,” said Raeker, who is white.
Nearby, next to a large mural of Floyd, a local rapper, Jordan Wallingford, was taking a break from filming a music video. Wallingford, who performs under the name Haphduzn, said he at least wanted to see the garden, roundabout and raised fist sculpture stay permanently. “Because that was the spark that changed the world,” he said.
Deborah Straub, who for weeks has been handing out snacks to children from the neighborhood — “free candy, free chips, free popcorn, free hot dogs,” she said — said the area should be preserved.
“Leave everything the way it is,” she said.

WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee tensely confronted each other over the federal response to the nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in police custody and the Russia investigation.
Democrats immediately accused Barr of making overtly political decisions to help President Donald Trump.
“You have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president,” Rep. Jerrold R. Nadler of New York, the committee chairman, said to Barr, who sat impassively.
Nadler added, “The message these actions send is clear: In this Justice Department, the president’s enemies will be punished and his friends will be protected, no matter the cost to liberty, no matter the cost to justice.”
He said that Barr’s actions eroded the separation of powers and damaged norms and the public’s faith in the administration of justice.
Barr came out swinging. In a prepared opening statement released a night earlier, he accused Democrats of demonizing him because he believed the Trump-Russia investigation was misguided.
He also warned that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction” in places like Portland, Oregon.
In his prepared statement, which he did not fully read aloud, Barr said: “We should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners.”
His comments were the latest attempt by federal officials to draw more attention to vandals’ nightly bids to damage federal buildings in Portland, accusing local police of doing little to stop them. City officials have accused federal agents of being heavy-handed and said their presence reinvigorated tensions that had been subsiding.
The attorney general appears to have played a primary role in using federal agents to violently clear protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House last month before a photo opportunity for Trump in front of a church. Although the White House initially said that Barr had ordered the clearance, he later said that he had not given a “tactical” order. Either way, Democrats were livid over his presence and have come to see Barr as a key impediment to overhauls of policing that enjoy broad public support.
More recently, he has become a face of the Trump administration’s pledge to surge federal agents into Democratic-led cities like Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Kansas City, Missouri, where, the White House says, violence has increased, both during protests and elsewhere. The federal intervention — the details of which remain hazy — is quickly becoming another flashpoint in the monthslong cultural reckoning over systemic racism, and it appears to be a key campaign strategy by Trump, who is trying to stoke a sense that Democrats are leading the country into chaos.
Republicans and Democrats each played videos to make competing points about protests.
Republicans had counterpunches of their own. Their most visceral case came in the form of a five-minute video montage that appeared to show protesters or people infiltrating their ranks across the country turning to violence.
“I want to thank you for defending law enforcement, for pointing out what a crazy idea the defund the police policy, whatever you want to call it, is, and standing up for the rule of law,” Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the panel’s top Republican, told Barr before playing the video. It began with footage of cable news anchors describing the protests as “peaceful” before streaming through scenes like a police precinct being set ablaze in Minneapolis, American flags burning, cans being hurled at police and stores looted.
While some protesters have been violent, many others have been peaceful and have included high school students, military veterans, off-duty lawyers and lines of mothers who call themselves the “Wall of Moms.”
The video that Jordan played omitted instances in which federal agents, who arrived in the city July 4, had responded aggressively and sometimes with disproportionate force through the use of tear gas, and flash bangs and pepper balls.
Video shows that in come cases, agents attacked protesters when there was no apparent threat, including the case of a Navy veteran whose hands were smashed by officers.
In the afternoon, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., grilled Barr about instances in which peaceful protesters — and some elected officials who joined them — have been injured or subjected to tear gas.
“I want to let you see now a video that fairly represents peaceful protest that is happening now across America that you conveniently omitted from your testimony and your statement,” Cicilline said.
He defended the protests as a fundamental American value and said it was important to remember that what inspired them was the abuse of African Americans by police. His montage featured footage of demonstrators kneeling and holding their arms aloft, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”
Democrats criticized Barr’s intervention in the Roger Stone case.
Democrats attacked Barr’s intervention to recommend a shorter prison sentence for Trump’s longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. on seven felony crimes — a sentence that Trump has since commuted.
Barr defended his extraordinary decision to overrule career prosecutors, saying that they were trying to treat Stone more harshly than other defendants.The Judiciary Committee heard testimony from a prosecutor on the case last month accusing department leaders of changing the sentencing recommendation for “political reasons.”
“The prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice what anyone else in a similar position had ever served,” Barr said. “This is a 67-year-old man, first-time offender, no violence — they were trying to put them in jail for seven to nine years. I was not going to advocate that. That is not the rule of law.”
But the prosecutors said in court that they arrived at the seven- to nine-year recommendation by following the department’s own sentencing guidelines, as is customary in any federal criminal case. Questioned by the federal judge who oversaw the Stone case, department officials acknowledged that it was the policy of the U.S. attorney’s office to seek the harshest possible sentence under the sentencing guidelines and to let the judge decide whether it was warranted. She questioned why the Justice Department treated Stone more leniently than other defendants.
Under questioning by Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., Barr agreed that the prosecutors’ recommendation was within sentencing guidelines.
“But it was not within Justice Department policy in my view,” he said.
In an especially heated exchange, Johnson retorted: “You are expecting the American people to believe that you did not do what Trump wanted you to do? You think the American people don’t understand that you were carrying out Trump’s” wishes?
“Let me ask you,” Barr replied. “Do you think it is fair for a 67-year-old man to be sent to prison for seven to nine years?” He insisted that he never discussed his decision to overrule Stone’s prosecutors with anyone at the White House.
Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., later asked Barr repeatedly if he would point to any other case in which the department had recommended a more lenient punishment than the guidelines set out for a defendant like Stone, who had threatened a judge and a witness.
Barr did not answer directly, insisting that “the judge agreed with me” and gave Stone a lighter sentence.
Deutch was displeased.
“The essence of the rule of law is that we have one rule for everybody, and we don’t in this case because he is a friend of the president,” he said.
Democrats want answers on Barr’s approach to the Mueller investigation.
House Democrats have sought to press Barr on his handling of the Russia report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for more than a year. They finally have their chance.
A federal judge has said that in summarizing the report himself weeks before releasing it, Barr put forward a “distorted” and “misleading” account that torqued public understanding of it in a way that favored Trump. Democrats felt at the time that those distortions brazenly helped protect Trump politically from possible impeachment — an accusation that Barr denies.
But his written opening statement suggested that Democrats’ hatred of Trump has blinded them to abuses by law enforcement and intelligence officials. He said: “Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus ‘Russiagate’ scandal, many of the Democrats on this committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the president’s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions.”
He has long been a critic of law enforcement and intelligence officials’ attempts to understand Russia’s efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and whether any Trump associates conspired. Barr has directed a criminal prosecutor to scrutinize the FBI inquiry into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and stepped in to reverse key prosecutorial decisions stemming from the investigation.
Mueller’s report said that Russia favored Trump and that his campaign welcomed the interference and expected to benefit from it, but that investigators found insufficient evidence to bring criminal conspiracy charges.
Barr also said that Trump has never tried to “interfere” in his decisions and that he feels that he has “complete freedom” to do what he thinks is right.
But Trump has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department’s investigations and employees. Barr himself expressed frustration with Trump’s attacks, saying in February that his public statements and tweets “make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we’re doing our work with integrity.”
Republicans want details on the Justice Department’s scrutiny of the Russia inquiry.
Republicans have cheered on Barr as he took steps to discredit the Russia investigation, and Tuesday, they accused Democrats of trying to smear him because he called out members of their party when he said last year that he was scrutinizing the inquiry.
“They have been attacking you ever since for simply stating the truth that the Obama-Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign,” Rep. Jordan of Ohio said.
They also fished for more clues about where he is going, welcoming Barr’s response when he noted that he had asked a U.S. attorney in Texas, John F. Bash, to review some matters related to the inquiry.
That was in addition to the criminal prosecutor, John H. Durham, whom Barr has appointed to lead the scrutiny of the case. The attorney general has repeatedly hinted at possible indictments and has suggested that he does not believe long-standing department policy against taking actions that could affect elections should apply to Durham’s work this fall.
Mueller’s investigators determined that Trump’s campaign welcomed Moscow’s help in 2016 but found insufficient evidence to charge any campaign officials or Trump associates with conspiring with the interference by a hostile foreign power.
Barr was questioned about his warning of widespread voter fraud.
As states prepare for record numbers of voters to cast ballots this fall by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic, Barr has provided key backup to Trump’s claims of rampant fraud. Democrats fear their comments are intended to or will at least have the effect of suppressing voter turnout or limiting access to the ballot box.
After Trump attacked efforts to expand mail-in voting during the pandemic and claimed it would be used to rig the election against him — even though the president has voted by mail — Barr has repeatedly raised without evidence, including in interviews with The New York Times and Fox News, the suggestion that a foreign country could engage in fraud by counterfeiting numerous ballots.
Experts say that a foreign-sponsored plot to systematically tamper with ballots is nearly impossible because of how they are printed and tracked. Many states have been conducting elections by mail for years without any major security problems or widespread fraud.
At the hearing, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., asked Barr whether he believed the 2020 election would be rigged. The attorney general said he had no reason to think it would be. Richmond then followed up by asking whether he believed that mail-in voting would lead to massive voter fraud.
“I think there is a high risk that it will,” Barr replied, adding: “If you have wholesale mail-in voting, it increases the risk of fraud.”
Barr did not explain further, and Richmond did not ask him whether any evidence existed supporting his earlier claims that foreign governments could counterfeit and mail in tens of thousands of ballots. But the lawmakers did get Barr to acknowledge that he had once cast a ballot by mail.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — Tuesday’s testimony by Attorney General William Barr in front of the House Judiciary Committee got off to a tense start.
Democrats immediately accused Barr of making overtly political decisions to help President Donald Trump.
“You have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president,” Rep. Jerrold R. Nadler of New York, the committee chairman, said to Barr, who sat impassively.
Nadler added, “The message these actions send is clear: In this Justice Department, the president’s enemies will be punished and his friends will be protected, no matter the cost to liberty, no matter the cost to justice.”
He said that Barr’s actions eroded the separation of powers and damaged norms and the public’s faith in the administration of justice.
Barr came out swinging. In a prepared opening statement released Monday night, he accused Democrats of demonizing him because he believed the Trump-Russia investigation was misguided and aggressively defended the federal response to the nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in May while he was in police custody in Minneapolis.
The attorney general appears to have played a primary role in using federal agents to violently clear protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House last month before a photo opportunity for Trump in front of a church. Although the White House initially said that Barr had ordered the clearance, he later said that he had not given a “tactical” order. Either way, Democrats were livid over his presence and have come to see Barr as a key impediment to overhauls of policing that enjoy broad public support.
More recently, he has become a face of the Trump administration’s pledge to surge federal agents into Democratic-led cities like Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Kansas City, Missouri, where, the White House says, violence has increased, both during protests and elsewhere. The federal intervention — the details of which remain hazy — is quickly becoming another flashpoint in the monthslong cultural reckoning over systemic racism, and it appears to be a key campaign strategy by Trump, who is trying to stoke a sense that Democrats are leading the country into chaos.
Republicans played a video highlighting violence against police.
Republicans had counterpunches of their own. Their most visceral case came in the form of a five-minute video montage that appeared to show protesters or people infiltrating their ranks across the country turning to violence.
“I want to thank you for defending law enforcement, for pointing out what a crazy idea the defund the police policy, whatever you want to call it, is, and standing up for the rule of law,” Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the panel’s top Republican, told Barr before playing the video. It began with footage of cable news anchors describing the protests as “peaceful” before streaming through scenes like a police precinct being set ablaze in Minneapolis, American flags burning, cans being hurled at police and stores looted.
The attorney general needed little help defending himself, though. In his prepared remarks, he warned that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction” in places like Portland.
In his prepared statement submitted to the committee, which he did not fully read aloud, Barr also said: “We should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners.”
His comments were the latest attempt by federal officials to draw more attention to vandals’ nightly bids to damage federal buildings in Portland, accusing local police of doing little to stop them. City officials have accused federal agents of being heavy-handed and said their presence reinvigorated tensions that had been subsiding.
While some protesters have been violent, many others have been peaceful and have included high school students, military veterans, off-duty lawyers and lines of mothers who call themselves the “Wall of Moms.”
The video that Jordan played omitted instances in which federal agents, who arrived in the city July 4, had responded aggressively and sometimes with disproportionate force through the use of tear gas, and flash bangs and pepper balls.
Video shows that in come cases, agents attacked protesters when there was no apparent threat, including the case of a Navy veteran whose hands were smashed by officers.
Democrats criticized Barr’s interventions in the Roger Stone and Michael Flynn cases.
Specifically, Democrats attacked Barr’s intervention to recommend a shorter prison sentence for Trump’s longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. on seven felony crimes — a sentence Trump has since commuted — and to drop charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn even though he had pleaded guilty.
The Judiciary Committee heard testimony from a prosecutor on the Stone case last month accusing department leaders of changing a sentencing recommendation for Stone for “political reasons.”
Barr defended his extraordinary decision to overrule career prosecutors and recommend a lighter sentence for Stone, saying that the prosecutors were treating Stone more harshly than other defendants and that he acted “without regard to political or personal.”
“The prosecutors were trying to advocate for a sentence that was more than twice what anyone else in a similar position had ever served,” Barr said. “This is a 67-year-old man, first-time offender, no violence — they were trying to put them in jail for seven to nine years. I was not going to advocate that. That is not the rule of law.”
But the prosecutors said in court that they arrived at the seven- to nine-year recommendation by following the department’s own sentencing guidelines, as is customary in any federal criminal case. Questioned by the federal judge who oversaw the Stone case, department officials acknowledged that it was the policy of the U.S. attorney’s office to seek the harshest possible sentence under the sentencing guidelines and to let the judge decide whether it was warranted. She questioned why the Justice Department treated Stone more leniently than other defendants
Democrats want answers on Barr’s approach to the Mueller investigation.
House Democrats have sought to press Barr on his handling of the Russia report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for more than a year. They finally have their chance.

He has suggested that he does not believe that long-standing department policy against taking actions that could affect elections should apply to Durham’s work this fall and that he worries federal agents unfairly and dangerously targeted Trump and his campaign.
In the meantime, Republican lawmakers are likely to ask for Barr’s thoughts on a raft of recently declassified case files that they argue show FBI agents were relying on shoddy foreign information to undertake key investigative actions into Trump’s associates.
Mueller’s investigators determined that Trump’s campaign welcomed Moscow’s help in 2016 but found insufficient evidence to charge any campaign officials or Trump associates with conspiring with the interference by a hostile foreign power.
Barr may also be questioned about his warning of widespread voter fraud.

Democrats fear their comments are intended to or will at least have the effect of suppressing voter turnout or limiting access to the ballot box.
In an interview with Fox News last month, Barr said widespread vote by mail “opens the floodgates to fraud,” including by a foreign power.
“Right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot,” Barr said.
He made similar comments to The New York Times.
“In terms of foreign influence, there are a number of foreign countries that could easily make counterfeit ballots, put names on them, send them in,” he said.
Like Trump, the attorney general has not presented evidence to back up his claims but has mostly spoken in hypotheticals about the insecurity of mailboxes.
Experts say that tampering with ballots is nearly impossible because of how they are printed and tracked. Many states have been conducting elections by mail for years without any major security problems or widespread fraud.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Maya D. Wiley, a former top counsel for Mayor Bill de Blasio, is leaving her role as a contributor on MSNBC and NBC News to explore a run for mayor of New York City, an official at MSNBC confirmed Tuesday.
Wiley, a Black former chairwoman of the city’s police oversight agency, would be entering a mayor’s race that has been reshaped by recent Black Lives Matter protests and the coronavirus pandemic.
If she runs, she would likely be a formidable candidate as she vied to become the first female mayor of New York City.
Wiley, a civil rights lawyer whose father was a well-known civil rights leader, could distinguish herself as a top-tier candidate by focusing on race and criminal justice issues; she served roughly a year as chairwoman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
She has worked as a professor at The New School and regularly appeared on MSNBC, grabbing the attention of its left-leaning viewership, an important demographic in a Democratic primary in New York.
Her departure from MSNBC and NBC News, where she has appeared on television as a legal analyst, was confirmed by a spokeswoman at MSNBC.
But she has also faced criticism over her time at the civilian review board and her work for de Blasio, which included an instance where she had argued that the mayor’s email communications with certain outside advisers were protected because the advisers were acting as “agents of the city.”
Thousands of pages of those emails were eventually released in what became an embarrassing episode for the mayor.
Wiley would enter a crowded primary race for mayor next June. Several Democratic candidates are already raising money, including Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president who is Black; Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker who is white; and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller who is white. Some have called on Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate who is Black, to run as a forceful voice against police brutality, but he says he does not plan to run.
But Wiley is well known. She already has more than 330,000 followers on Twitter, compared with nearly 8,000 for Stringer’s personal account. She could catch up on fundraising by tapping the national audience she found on MSNBC, said Christina M. Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University.
As for her voting base, Wiley could gain support in Brooklyn, where she lives, and in liberal pockets of the city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 6-1.
“Anyone who likes smart women — that’s one base,” Greer said.
Wiley has been meeting with elected officials, union leaders and progressive activists to discuss the mayor’s race, according to a person who was familiar with her exploration of whether to run.
Wiley appeared live on MSNBC on Tuesday to weigh in on the hearing of William Barr, the attorney general, before the House Judiciary Committee. She did not respond to requests for comment and referred questions to Jon Paul Lupo, a political consultant who has served as an adviser to de Blasio and worked on the mayor’s presidential campaign.
Lupo said Wiley did not want to discuss her private deliberations over the race, and would not comment on what her time frame might be for deciding whether she would run.
Wiley’s ties to the mayor, who is unpopular and has received criticism for his handling of the protests and the coronavirus pandemic, could be one of her greatest challenges, along with the fact that she has not been elected to any office before.
“She needs to make sure she’s not yoked to de Blasio in a negative way,” Greer said.
De Blasio, a Democrat in his second term, must step down because of term limits.
Wiley resigned as the mayor’s lawyer in 2016 after growing discouraged over not being part of de Blasio’s inner circle, according to a person who was familiar with her thinking at the time. She moved to the citizen review board, which investigates and makes recommendations about complaints against police officers for using excessive force.
At the board, she was praised for holding more public meetings. But critics say the agency was still too secretive and sluggish. In a report on the use of Taser stun guns released when she was chairwoman, the agency removed language that highlighted how officers had mostly used the stun guns on people who were unarmed.
Wiley’s father, George A. Wiley, was the former head of the National Welfare Rights Organization and achieved national prominence for organizing poor Black and white people. He died in a boating accident in 1973.
She has attended the recent wave of protests and called on de Blasio’s police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, to resign — a possible sign that she may seek to distance herself from her former boss.
Carl Heastie, the State Assembly speaker and an influential Black leader, posted photos on social media from a meal he had with Wiley earlier this month. Seated outside with both wearing masks, Heastie thanked her for coming to the Bronx to have Caribbean food and an “even greater conversation about the future of the Bronx and NYC.”
The race is in flux because of the pandemic, and it remains to be seen whether voters would rather elect a candidate with deep political experience or perhaps an outsider in the mold of someone like Michael Bloomberg, said Rebecca Katz, a former adviser to de Blasio.
“Anyone who has been in Maya’s presence knows that she is a force,” she said, “and I would not underestimate her.”

WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr will travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for his first congressional testimony in more than a year, and lawmakers are prepared to press for explanations on the federal response to nationwide protests of police killings of Black Americans and the handling of criminal cases involving President Donald Trump’s allies.
The hearing before the House Judiciary Committee is certain to be tense and likely one of the final congressional oversight showdowns of Trump’s first term. Barr plans to come out swinging. In a prepared opening statement released Monday night, he aggressively defended the federal response to the protests and accused Democrats of demonizing him because he believed the Trump-Russia investigation was misguided.
The socially distant hearing was scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. ET but was delayed 45 minutes after the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, was involved in a car accident en route to Washington. Nadler was uninjured, according to a spokesman.
Here’s what to expect when the hearing gets underway.
Lawmakers will focus on the protests — to different ends.
Democrats are prepared to accuse Barr, the nation’s top law enforcement officer, of making overtly political decisions to help Trump. But their most pressing examples will be the federal response to nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in May while he was in police custody in Minneapolis.
The attorney general appears to have played a primary role in using federal agents to violently clear protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House last month before a photo opportunity for Trump in front of a church. Although the White House initially said that Barr had ordered the clearance, he later said that he had not given a “tactical” order. Either way, Democrats were livid over his presence and have come to see Barr as a key impediment to overhauls of policing that enjoy broad public support.
More recently, he has become a face of the Trump administration’s pledge to surge federal agents into Democratic-led cities like Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Kansas City, Missouri, where, the White House says, protests have descended into violence, including against federal buildings. The federal intervention — the details of which remain hazy — is quickly becoming another flashpoint in the monthslong cultural reckoning over systemic racism, and it appears to be a key campaign strategy by Trump, who is trying to stoke a sense that Democrats are leading the country into chaos.
Republicans plan to use much of their allotted time to buck up Barr, whom they see as holding the line against protesters they accuse of targeting police and federal property while using Floyd’s name as cover.
But the attorney general seems unlikely to need much help. In his prepared remarks, he warned that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction” in places like Portland.
“We should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners,” he planned to say.
His comments were the latest attempt by federal officials to draw more attention to vandals’ nightly bids to damage federal buildings in Portland, accusing local police of doing little to stop them. City officials have accused federal agents of being heavy-handed and said their presence reinvigorated tensions that had been subsiding.
Barr was also prepared to testify that the aftermath of Floyd’s death had led to “demonizing police” and accusations of systemic racism in law enforcement. That view is an “oversimplification,” he will say, of a more complex mix of problems that prompt mistrust in police by people of color.
Democrats want answers on Barr’s interventions in the Stone and Flynn cases.
House Democrats have sought to press Barr on his handling of the Russia report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for more than a year. They will finally have their chance.
A federal judge has said that in summarizing the report himself weeks before releasing it, Barr put forward a “distorted” and “misleading” account that torqued public understanding of it in a way that favored Trump. Democrats felt at the time that those distortions brazenly helped protect Trump politically from possible impeachment — an accusation that Barr denies.
Since then, the attorney general has directed a criminal prosecutor to scrutinize the FBI inquiry into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and stepped in to reverse key prosecutorial decisions stemming from the investigation.
Specifically, Democrats will ask about his intervention to recommend a shorter prison sentence for Trump’s longtime friend Roger Stone on seven felony crimes — a sentence that Trump has since commuted — and to drop charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn even though he had pleaded guilty.
The Judiciary Committee heard testimony from a prosecutor on the Stone case last month accusing department leaders of changing a sentencing recommendation for Stone for “political reasons.” A second whistleblower at that session also accused Barr of ordering antitrust investigations to harass marijuana sellers in states that have legalized the substance and to scrutinize California’s emissions deal with automakers after Trump attacked it.
Barr is prepared to testify that he acted “without partisan considerations” and that Democrats’ hatred of Trump has blinded them to abuses by law enforcement and intelligence officials. (He did not address the cases specifically in his prepared opening statement.)
“Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus ‘Russiagate’ scandal, many of the Democrats on this committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the president’s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions,” Barr planned to say.
He has long been a critic of law enforcement and intelligence officials’ attempts to understand Russia’s efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and whether any Trump associates conspired.
Mueller’s report said that Russia favored Trump and that his campaign welcomed the interference and expected to benefit from it, but that investigators found insufficient evidence to bring criminal conspiracy charges.
Barr will also say that Trump has never tried to “interfere” in his decisions, giving him “complete freedom” to do what he thinks is right.
Republicans want details on the investigation examining the Russia inquiry.
Republicans have cheered on Barr as he took steps to discredit the Russia investigation. On Tuesday, they will be fishing for more clues about where he is going.
Barr appointed a criminal prosecutor, John H. Durham, to lead the scrutiny, has repeatedly hinted at possible indictments and could provide new details. He has suggested that he does not believe that long-standing department policy against taking actions that could affect elections should apply to Durham’s work this fall and that he worries federal agents unfairly and dangerously targeted Trump and his campaign.
In the meantime, Republican lawmakers are likely to ask for Barr’s thoughts on a raft of recently declassified case files that they argue show FBI agents were relying on shoddy foreign information to undertake key investigative actions into Trump’s associates.
Mueller’s investigators determined that Trump’s campaign welcomed Moscow’s help in 2016 but found insufficient evidence to charge any campaign officials or Trump associates with conspiring with the interference by a hostile foreign power.
Barr may also be questioned about his warning of widespread voter fraud.
With states preparing for record numbers of voters to cast ballots this fall by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic, Barr has provided key backup to Trump’s claims of rampant fraud. Democrats fear their comments are intended to or will at least have the effect of suppressing voter turnout or limiting access to the ballot box.
In an interview with Fox News last month, Barr said widespread vote by mail “opens the floodgates to fraud,” including by a foreign power.
“Right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot,” Barr said.
He made similar comments to The New York Times.
“In terms of foreign influence, there are a number of foreign countries that could easily make counterfeit ballots, put names on them, send them in,” he said.
Like Trump, the attorney general has not presented evidence to back up his claims but has mostly spoken in hypotheticals about the insecurity of mailboxes.
Experts say that tampering with ballots is nearly impossible because of how they are printed and tracked. Many states have been conducting elections by mail for years without any major security problems or widespread fraud.

WASHINGTON — Tuesday’s testimony by Attorney General William Barr in front of the House Judiciary Committee got off to a tense start.
Democrats immediately accused Barr of making overtly political decisions to help President Donald Trump.
“You have aided and abetted the worst failings of the president,” Rep. Jerrold R. Nadler of New York, the committee chairman, said to Barr, who sat impassively.
Nadler added, “The message these actions send is clear: In this Justice Department, the president’s enemies will be punished and his friends will be protected, no matter the cost to liberty, no matter the cost to justice.”
He said that Barr’s actions eroded the separation of powers and damaged norms and the public’s faith in the administration of justice.
Barr came out swinging. In a prepared opening statement released Monday night, he accused Democrats of demonizing him because he believed the Trump-Russia investigation was misguided and aggressively defended the federal response to the nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in May while he was in police custody in Minneapolis.
The attorney general appears to have played a primary role in using federal agents to violently clear protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House last month before a photo opportunity for Trump in front of a church. Although the White House initially said that Barr had ordered the clearance, he later said that he had not given a “tactical” order. Either way, Democrats were livid over his presence and have come to see Barr as a key impediment to overhauls of policing that enjoy broad public support.
More recently, he has become a face of the Trump administration’s pledge to surge federal agents into Democratic-led cities like Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Kansas City, Missouri, where, the White House says, protests have descended into violence, including against federal buildings. The federal intervention — the details of which remain hazy — is quickly becoming another flashpoint in the monthslong cultural reckoning over systemic racism, and it appears to be a key campaign strategy by Trump, who is trying to stoke a sense that Democrats are leading the country into chaos.
Republicans plan to use much of their allotted time to buck up Barr, whom they see as holding the line against protesters they accuse of targeting police and federal property while using Floyd’s name as cover.
But the attorney general seems unlikely to need much help. He warned that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction” in places like Portland.
In a prepared opening statement submitted to the committee but that he did not fully read aloud, Barr also said: “We should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners.”
His comments were the latest attempt by federal officials to draw more attention to vandals’ nightly bids to damage federal buildings in Portland, accusing local police of doing little to stop them. City officials have accused federal agents of being heavy-handed and said their presence reinvigorated tensions that had been subsiding.
While some protesters have been violent, many others have been peaceful. In describing the demonstrations as hijacked by “violent rioters and anarchists” and emphasizing that federal agents were “charged with a defensive mission,” Barr also omitted that federal agents have aggressively responded by using tear gas, munitions fired from paintball-style guns and baton — and recently escalated violence in Portland.
Barr also cited statistics compiled by The Washington Post to compare the number of unarmed Black men killed by police (eight) to the number of unarmed white men killed by police (11) this year. It was an echo of Trump’s technically accurate, but misleading, claim that “more white” Americans are killed by police than Black Americans. The Post also noted that Black Americans are killed at more than twice the rate as white Americans, when factoring in population size. Research has also shown that across the United States, on average, that the probability of being Black, unarmed and shot is higher than being white, armed and shot.
Barr also said that the aftermath of Floyd’s death had led to “demonizing police” and accusations of systemic racism in law enforcement. That view is an “oversimplification,” he said, of a more complex mix of problems that prompt mistrust in police by people of color.
Democrats want answers on Barr’s interventions in the Stone and Flynn cases.
House Democrats have sought to press Barr on his handling of the Russia report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, for more than a year. They will finally have their chance.
A federal judge has said that in summarizing the report himself weeks before releasing it, Barr put forward a “distorted” and “misleading” account that torqued public understanding of it in a way that favored Trump.

Barr testified that he acted “without regard to political or personal.”
His written opening statement went further, suggesting that Democrats’ hatred of Trump has blinded them to abuses by law enforcement and intelligence officials, and saying: “Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus ‘Russiagate’ scandal, many of the Democrats on this committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the president’s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions.”

Barr said that Trump has never tried to “interfere” in his decisions and that he feels that he has “complete freedom” to do what he thinks is right.
But Trump has repeatedly attacked the Justice Department’s investigations and employees. Barr himself expressed frustration with Trump’s attacks, saying in February that his public statements and tweets “make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we’re doing our work with integrity.”
Republicans want details on the Justice Department’s scrutiny of the Russia inquiry.
Republicans have cheered on Barr as he took steps to discredit the Russia investigation, and Tuesday, they accused Democrats of trying to smear him because he called out members of their party when he said last year that he was scrutinizing the inquiry.
“They have been attacking you ever since for simply stating the truth that the Obama-Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign,” said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the panel.
They will be fishing for more clues about where he is going.
Barr appointed a criminal prosecutor, John H. Durham, to lead the scrutiny, has repeatedly hinted at possible indictments and could provide new details. He has suggested that he does not believe that long-standing department policy against taking actions that could affect elections should apply to Durham’s work this fall and that he worries federal agents unfairly and dangerously targeted Trump and his campaign.

PORTLAND, Ore. — A week after federal officers in Portland, Oregon, brutally struck a Navy veteran who said he had approached them simply to ask a question, a group of military veterans Friday joined the front lines of the city’s growing protests.
Duston Obermeyer, a Marine Corps veteran, said he and other veterans were there to make sure federal officers did not infringe on the free speech of protesters, who numbered in the thousands.
“Our veterans are here specifically to support the rights of the protesters to protest,” said Obermeyer, who said he had deployed three times during a decade in the Marines.
The group of vets lined up in front of a fence erected outside the federal courthouse. They stayed together until a cloud of tear gas scattered much of the crowd.
While President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have repeatedly labeled the protesters in Portland as “violent anarchists,” demonstrators have banded together in groups. A “Wall of Moms” has grown to include hundreds of women in yellow shirts linking arms. A “Wall of Dads” in orange shirts has included some with leaf blowers used to push tear gas away from the crowds. Many nurses Saturday showed up in blue scrubs.
Local officials have demanded that federal agents leave the city, saying their presence has inflamed tensions and their tactics have been outrageous. One of those concerning cases was that of Christopher J. David, a Navy veteran who said he went to the protests for the first time last weekend to ask officers whether they felt their actions violated the Constitution.
As he stood still in front of the officers, one began hitting him with a baton. David said the attack broke his fingers.
Obermeyer cited that case as one of the motivations of the “Wall of Vets.”
Another veteran, Clint Hall, said he came out to support the Black Lives Matter movement. Carrying a “Disabled Veterans 4 BLM” sign, the Army veteran said the federal presence in the city had simply increased the tension.
“Things were getting better, and then they came here and made it worse,” Hall said. “Enough is enough.”
After suffering through the tear gas that was shot into the crowd, Hall said that the tear gas was so strong that it was leaving burns on his skin. He said it felt worse than the tear gas he recalled from his time in the Army.
“This response from the feds is over the top,” he said.

When a video showing George Floyd’s death in police custody spread across social media, cities and towns nationwide soon erupted in protests against systemic racism and police brutality. But while protests in many places subsided after a few weeks, Portland, Oregon, has been holding demonstrations every night since May 29.The arrival of federal forces in the city this month — and concerns they were exceeding their authority and violating protesters’ rights — drew the ire of local officials and reinvigorated nightly demonstrations. With renewed force, marchers have spray-painted the walls of the U.S. District Court building, demanding that federal agents go home. Groups of mothers have banded together, locking arms and chanting: “Feds stay clear. Moms are here.”
Early in the protests, protesters broke into the Multnomah County Justice Center and set some of the offices on fire, and the Portland police have reported cases of looting. More recently, demonstrators have thrown rocks and bottles at federal officers. But many have protested peacefully, and Gov. Kate Brown has called the presence of federal agents an “abuse of power.”
President Donald Trump has called the demonstrators “anarchists” who “hate” the country, and Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, has blamed Oregon officials for the unrest.
What are the protesters demanding?
What started out as a movement for police accountability and racial justice has morphed into a complex mobilization. The protesters’ goals now include defunding the police, addressing income inequality and pushing federal agents out of the city.
In Portland, which is one of America’s whitest cities and has a racist history, protesters have maintained a public call for change that has subsided elsewhere in the country.
Experts say the protests bring together a coalition of racial justice proponents and anti-fascist advocates, who have long been active in Portland. The groups share some intersecting grievances and common goals, such as cutting police budgets and installing more civilian oversight of the police.
Signs such as “White Silence=Violence” and “Black Lives Matter” are widespread, and calls at the demonstrations to address racial inequities persist. One woman held a sign that said: “My Black Child is Watching! #BLM She Will Know Her Life Matters.”
Demonstrators have also expressed increasing frustration with the federal presence and the Trump administration.
“What is making more people come to the street every night now is the brutalization that’s happening to regular community members at the hands of Portland police and these federal agents,” Jo Ann Hardesty, a city commissioner, said at a news conference.
How has the city responded?
Street protests began four days after the death of Floyd in Minneapolis. As the demonstrations continued and officers used tear gas to disperse crowds, public outrage against aggressive police tactics increased and calls to defund the police escalated.
On June 8, after more than a week of large-scale demonstrations involving thousands of marchers, the chief of the Portland Police Bureau stepped down, saying new leadership was needed to rebuild public trust. Shortly after, a federal judge upheld restrictions on tear gas put in place by Mayor Ted Wheeler, barring the use of the chemical agent except when life or safety was at risk.
The City Council also passed a budget that would cut $15 million from the police in the upcoming fiscal year, a demand sought by protesters.
Why have the protests continued this long?
By late June, the size of protests had diminished significantly. Rose City Justice, a major mobilizing force in Portland, announced plans to pull back on organizing efforts. Nightly marches, numbering in the hundreds, became more decentralized.
But after federal agents, including some from the Department of Homeland Security, arrived in July, reports soon emerged that they had forcefully pulled people into unmarked vehicles, injured protesters and deployed tear gas. Mayor Wheeler, who called the situation “an attack on our democracy.” was tear-gassed with a group of protesters outside the federal courthouse.
By the time the federal agents arrived, city leaders said, the situation on the streets had de-escalated. But outrage at the Trump administration’s deployment reinvigorated the daily rallies.
Which federal law enforcement agencies are involved?
The federal agents present in Portland include personnel from the U.S. Marshals and tactical agents from Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in addition to the Federal Protective Service, which was already stationed to protect federal property in Portland.
Some of the agents are from a group known as BORTAC, the Border Patrol’s equivalent of a SWAT team, which typically investigates drug smuggling organizations.
What is motivating the movement in Portland?
Oregon has a history of white supremacy. A law passed in 1844 said that any Black person would be “whipped twice a year until he or she shall quit the territory,” and leaders also later banned Black people from entering the territory.
Some protesters say the state’s deeply racist history is still reflected in Portland’s structures. One protester, Reginald Liggins, who is Black, told The New York Times that he began commuting by bus after being pulled over multiple times by the Portland police without reason. Liza Lopetrone, a veterinary nurse who is white and joined the Wall of Moms protest this past week, said she wanted to bring the state’s white supremacist legacy to light.
Others were not moved to participate until federal agents entered the city. Christopher J. David, a Navy veteran who was filmed being beaten with a baton by federal officers, had not followed the protests until U.S. agents were deployed. He came to the protests to ask officers about their use of violent tactics against protesters, which he said conflicted with their oath to uphold the Constitution.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Seyi Fasoranti, a chemist who moved to Oregon from the East Coast six months ago, has watched the Black Lives Matter protests in Portland with fascination. A sea of white faces in one of the whitest major American cities has cried out for racial justice every night for nearly two months.
“It’s something I joke about with my friends,” Fasoranti, who is Black, said over the din of protest chants this week. “There are more Black Lives Matter signs in Portland than Black people.”
Loud advocacy has been a hallmark of Portland life for decades, but unlike past protests over environmental policies or foreign wars, racism is a more complicated topic in Oregon, one that is intertwined with demographics and the state’s legacy of some of the most brutal anti-Black laws in the nation.
During 56 straight nights of protests here, throngs of largely white protesters have raised their fists in the air and chanted, “This is not a riot, it’s a revolution.” They have thrown water bottles at the federal courthouse, tried to pry off the plywood that protects the entrance and engaged in running battles with police officers through clouds of tear gas. In recent nights, the number of protesters has swollen into the thousands.
Damany Igwé, 43, a bath products salesman who is Black and has taken part in dozens of the protests, says white crowds have shielded him from police, all the while yelling “Black power!”
“I feel the most protected that I ever have in my city,” Igwé said during a Wednesday night protest that lasted well into Thursday morning. “White people can’t understand what we’ve been through completely, but they are trying to empathize. That’s a beginning.”
Of the 35 cities in the United States with populations larger than 500,000, Portland is the whitest, according to census data, with 71% of residents categorized as non-Latino whites.
Oregon’s relative homogeneity — the state is three-quarters white compared with neighboring California, where white people make up 37% of the population — was not accidental. The state was founded on principles of white supremacy. A 19th-century lash law called for whipping any Black person found in the state. In the early part of the 20th century Oregon’s Legislature was dominated by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
Today the average income level for Black families in Portland is nearly half that of white residents and police shootings of Black residents are disproportionate to their 6% share of the population. Three years ago, two good Samaritans were fatally stabbed while trying to stop a man from shouting slurs at two African American women on a commuter train, one of whom was wearing Muslim dress.
“Really there are two Portlands that exist,” said Walidah Imarisha, a scholar of Black history in Oregon. “There’s white Portland and Portland of color.”
The differences, she said, cover almost every aspect of life. “There’s massive racial disparities around wealth, health care, schools and criminal legal systems that white Portlanders just don’t understand.”
Yet on the streets this week in Portland there was optimism among Black protest leaders who generally spoke admiringly of the large white crowds, which were reinvigorated last week after clashes with federal riot police officers who are protecting a U.S. courthouse and other buildings.
Xavier Warner, a Black protest organizer, called the predominance of white protesters “a beautiful thing” that speaks to the progressive ethos in the city.
Teal Lindseth, another Black organizer, said she saw the irony in predominantly white Portland having among the longest continuous protests stemming from the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. But she said she was thankful for the strength in numbers. “They hurt us less when there are more people,” she said.
The role of white protesters has some detractors in the Black community.
In an op-ed published Thursday in The Washington Post, the Rev. E.D. Mondainé, president of the Portland branch of the NAACP, called the protests a “spectacle” that distracted attention from the Black Lives Matter movement.
“Are they really furthering the cause of justice, or is this another example of white co-optation?” he wrote.
But in a measure of the divided opinion on this question, Mondainé’s predecessor at the NAACP, Jo Ann Hardesty, a city commissioner, rejected his criticism.
“There’s a lot of new, aware folks who have joined into the battle for Black lives,” she said during a news conference Thursday.
Hardesty, who took office in 2019 as the first African American woman on the Portland City Council, said the protests were serving the dual purposes of fighting racial injustice and rejecting the presence of federal agents sent to the city by the Trump administration.
Both protest goals were important, she said. “And one is not any more important than the other.”
Joe Lowndes, an expert on right-wing politics and race at the University of Oregon, said the protests reflected an intertwining of interests in recent years between racial justice advocates and the largely white anti-fascist movement. Both are deeply distrustful of police and want police powers and budgets curtailed. The presence of far-right groups in Oregon, emboldened during the Trump administration, has also brought anti-racists and anti-fascists into closer alignment, he said.
Speeches and chants at the protests have touched on the legacy of slavery and the stripping of lands from Native Americans. From a historical perspective, the sight of hundreds of white protesters chanting one of that movement’s most popular refrains — “Stolen lands and stolen people” — can be jarring.
As the destination of the Lewis and Clark expeditions, Oregon once symbolized the conquest of the American West and the subjugation of Native peoples.
Some white protesters said it was this white supremacist legacy that helped spur them into the streets.
“Bringing that history to light is definitely a motivating factor,” said Liza Lopetrone, a veterinary nurse who joined the Wall of Moms protest this week that consisted mostly of white women locking arms in the face of the federal troops. “Oregon has an extremely racist history. I’m not from here but I take responsibility for it now.”
Another woman at the protest, Julie Liggins, had a more immediate connection to prejudice and racism in Portland. She is white and her husband of three decades, Reginald, is Black.
During the years he drove his car to work, Liggins said, he was pulled over by Portland police multiple times without cause. He said he switched to riding the bus. But two years ago when Liggins, who is 60, ran to catch a bus, the police pulled it over after misidentifying him for a robbery suspect in his 20s.
Liggins said he was encouraged by the protests even if he wished the reckoning over race in America had occurred earlier. And he loves his life in Portland.
“You can literally go days without seeing people that look like you,” he said. “But I find Portland to be a very progressive city despite its racist past. I can honestly say that as an interracial couple we haven’t had any problems here.”
Fasoranti, the chemist, says he has been impressed with the awareness of racial issues in Portland and described the current round of protests as something that “feels genuine.”
He says he feels welcome in the city and was intrigued soon after he arrived when a white motorist pulled over to the sidewalk and asked if he needed a ride. He has been invited to conversations about gentrification and the displacement of Black residents.
“There are less of these conversations in New York or New Jersey, where I used to live,” he said.

On the Latest Boutique Fitness Playlist: Black Lives Matter [With graphic(s)]

Before the pandemic changed the way we work out, possibly forever, Sarah Levey was among the boutique fitness industry’s fastest-rising stars. She and her husband, Mason Levey, are the founders of Y7, a yoga company with 14 studio locations in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, with classes costing $25 each, taking place in candlelit rooms with the heat and hip-hop playlists on full blast.
By 2017, Y7 had raised nearly $7 million from private equity backers. Levey appeared on the September 2018 cover of Inc. magazine as “yoga’s newest mogul.” A few months later, she told Forbes that her company’s success is built on “setting a vibe.”
This vibe included a heavy reliance on Black culture, starting with a Y7 branding tagline, “A Tribe Called Sweat,” prominently featured on walls and merchandise: a play on A Tribe Called Quest, the hip-hop group. Hip-hop music has been a big part of the company’s image, and its draw to yogis.
In 2018, the company hired a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant, Levey, who is Asian American, said in an interview. Among the recommendations was that Y7 stop branding itself as “hip-hop yoga.”
But as recently as May 25, Y7’s Instagram feed featured a black square with the name of hip-hop artist Young M.A. in white letters at its center, with the caption, “SAVAGE MODE - Join our 30-minute themed flow on IG Live this week ft. @youngma #HipHopWednesdays.”
At the bottom right of the black square was one of Y7’s hallmarks: a block of text mimicking the parental advisory label on music with explicit lyrics, reading, “Y7 Studios, Hip Hop Yoga, We Flow Hard.”
As civil rights protests grew in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, many companies vowed to revise their marketing and business practices to recognize racial injustice. Y7, which has laid off 340 workers and is down to 10 full-time and three part-time employees, is among them.
“What came out of a deep appreciation for the music became an appropriation that went on too long and was unaddressed as we expanded,” Levey said.
The company is now working with a Black-owned marketing firm to “freshen” Y7’s brand. It is doing away with #hiphopwednesday and #hiphopsunday classes, as well as the “tribe called sweat” line, and promising more scholarships for teacher training programs. The company also said it is refocusing efforts on programs that bring yoga to young people in underserved communities and other philanthropic activities when studios open again.
The American fitness industry has frequently profited from trends made popular by Black dancers, choreographers and music creators. Now it is being forced to address inequality at a time when studios and gyms around the country have been closed for months. This has resulted in layoffs of thousands of fitness workers, many of them Black and paid hourly, without benefits.
Peloton, the at-home fitness company, has thrived during lockdown.
In early June, as protesters marched in cities and towns around the world, Tunde Oyeneyin, a Black Peloton instructor, woke in the middle of the night and began to jot down thoughts about how to amplify their message on a bedside notepad.
In the morning, Oyeneyin received an email from Jen Cotter, the chief content officer of Peloton, asking if she would be interested in creating a spin class with a meditation, led by Chelsea Jackson Roberts, a yoga instructor, that would capture the importance of the moment.
Oyeneyin spent the next three days interviewing Black colleagues at Peloton, preparing an inspiring, provocative monologue quoting them and a playlist including songs like Nipsey Hussle’s “Right Hand 2 God,” “Patience” by Nas, featuring Damian Marley, and James Blake’s “Radio Silence,” which she would use to invoke the killing of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and “countless others.”
The result was “Speak Up,” a 30-minute class that has since been streamed more than 110,000 times.
In an interview, Oyeneyin said her goal was to combine the physical intensity of a tough workout with the emotional intensity of addressing how Black people can feel in predominantly white spaces, like fitness studios.
“I wanted to be able to elevate those Black voices, and I have this platform,” she said. “For 34 years, I have tiptoed around, trying not to make people uncomfortable at the expense of my own comfort.”
Oyeneyin’s class was like a prepared piece of performance art with an endorphin-doused audience. But a class led by one of Peloton’s longtime instructors, Alex Toussaint, was an improvised emotional address from a Black man who was, as he explained it, trying to reconcile the racism he has experienced throughout his personal life with the professional success and renown he has earned in the white world of corporate boutique fitness.
“I understand for some of y’all, I’m the one person from the African American community in your household,” Toussaint told his riders. “I understand that. My responsibility is to let you know there’s other individuals like me, who talk like me, who walk like me, who provide light to this world, man.”
He told his riders of his mother’s inability to sleep at night until she gets a text from him letting her know that he is home safely, and urged riders to extend their concern beyond posting on Instagram: “Less caption and more action,” he said.
The class has been streamed more than 65,000 times.
In an interview, Toussaint said that his father sent him to military school to help him avoid jail or worse, and that he has been pulled out of his car at gunpoint by police “because they are afraid of the color of my skin.”
He hoped to awaken students oblivious to such realities. “I’m a young Black male on a platform with 2 million people,” Toussaint said. “I’m out there to rep for my people, myself and my last name.”
Cotter, the Peloton executive, said the company applauded Oyeneyin and Toussaint’s self-expression. “We’re always considering it as part of our content strategy to create conversations,” she said. Instructors are generally expected to avoid political topics while teaching their classes, but the Black Lives Matter movement is different, she said. “We see this as a human rights issue. Those are not the same for us, politics and civil rights.”
The popular chain SoulCycle had marked Black History Month in February by sharing images and stories from Black studio managers and instructors. A few days after Floyd was killed, the company, like so many others, posted acknowledgment of anguish around the country, concluding, “#BlackLivesMatter today, every day, always.”
But to some customers, such messaging from the company, which has nearly 100 studios in three countries (but has lagged behind Peloton in marketing a home bike), rang hollow. Many were outraged last summer when Stephen Ross, the chairman of the Related Cos., whose principals own majority stakes in SoulCycle and the fitness club chain Equinox, hosted a high-priced fundraiser for President Donald Trump, whose administration ordered the tear-gassing of protesters, at Ross’ home in Southampton, New York. One typical comment on the Black Lives Matter post read: “SOULCYCLE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM STOP FUNDING TRUMP.”
The company, which in March introduced an at-home bike for riders that costs $2,500, also organized a series of free Zoom workouts, requesting that attendees donate to various charities combating racial inequality.
This irked some who wondered why the company wasn’t publicly donating its own money rather than soliciting from riders.
In response to SoulCycle marking the completion of the day’s classes with a “Thank You, Soul Fam” Instagram post, Zoe Galloway, a SoulCycle customer of 10 years, commented, “Putting your Black instructors on a podium (literally and figuratively) and having them perform to show that SoulCycle is inclusive is not how this is done.”
Earlier this month, flyers promoting SoulCycle’s Sirius XM channel were distributed at an outdoor ride in the Hamptons, raising eyebrows of some present because of its photograph of homogeneous white women.
But SoulCycle’s casting of Black instructors in other marketing materials has rankled employees who perceive it as tokenism, given the overwhelming whiteness in the executive ranks.
Then last week, Soeuraya Wilson, a popular instructor who was one of the faces of the SoulCycle at-home app, quit. She posted on Instagram that she did not want her image and body to be “used” by a company that, in her view, performs activism “when it is convenient for their bottom line or their seasonal campaign,” and stands with “investors and individuals who continue to support racism and bigotry without true compassion for the health and wellness of the employees and riders.”
A marketing photograph of Wilson on the new at-home bike was taken down this week and has been replaced with a shot of an empty bike.
On Wednesday, four more instructors at SoulCycle announced their resignation on Instagram. “Those that know me well, know that I advocate for authenticity in every aspect of life and with the times we are living in I must stand in truth,” wrote Tina Jackson, a Black instructor who had been with the company for seven years and whose image is used on SoulCycle’s Sirius XM’s marketing materials. “Who would I be as your teacher if I didn’t walk in my own words? If I didn’t stand up for what I believe?”
On Wednesday evening, SoulCycle posted on Instagram a lengthy letter from its interim chief executive, Sunder Reddy, promising to honor the company’s commitment to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. “Since March we have had to navigate unimaginably difficult economic, social and emotional situations,” he wrote, adding that “our ability to make meaningful financial contributions to outside organizations is limited today.”
Lockdown measures have been cataclysmic for the boutique fitness industry, which was built on packed, pricey indoor sessions, and some instructors feel too uncertain about their futures to quit. Rique Uresti, a SoulCycle senior master instructor since 2010 who was furloughed last week, said he agreed with much of what Wilson wrote in her post.
Uresti worries that instructors who haven’t followed Wilson out the door are assumed to support the company’s culture. “At what point do I draw the line of having an employer who, given what is going on, won’t meaningfully address it?” he said. “As a parent, can I cut off my bread and butter?”
Away from these big brands, Shaun Patrick Tubbs is a Black fitness instructor piecing together different gigs into a career with possibility. A manager and teacher at Harlem Cycle, he’s also leading spin classes for Myx Fitness, a new at-home equipment and streaming content company. He’s a coach for CityRow, which offers online training through CityRowGo, and working as a running motivational coach for CardioCast, an audio fitness content company.
Virtual fitness, when a student has a screen right in front of their face in the intimacy of their home, can sometimes seem more personal than being one of 30 in a packed studio.
“I know I am often the only Black person who the members have had in the living room, and there is pressure around that,” Tubbs said. “Pressure to be nonthreatening, pressure to be opening their minds and pressure to perhaps encourage them to have a conversation with others too.”
He said working in boutique fitness makes him a respected and admired figure in spaces dominated by white people. “But I’ll leave the studio in a hoodie and stand next to a client at the bus stop and say hi, and they can’t put it together that it’s me,” he said. “I don’t want to just be accepted as an instructor. I want to be accepted as a person.”

NEW YORK — Clashes between protesters and the police were familiar sights in the days after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer. But a new kind of unrest has emerged in recent days: confrontations between New Yorkers who support law enforcement and those who are pressing for an overhaul of the Police Department.
There have been raw encounters in Brooklyn, Queens and in Manhattan, as civilian groups identifying themselves as pro-police have led marches in support of the men and women in blue.
The pro-police rallies also attract counterprotesters. Violent clashes and arrests have played out this month as unsettling images of civilian-versus-civilian rage echo back to periods of racial violence in the city. New Yorkers are shouting, not at police officers, but over their shoulders, at one another.
Diane Atkins, who lives in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, attended pro-police events in the borough on a Saturday and a Sunday this month. “We wanted to stand up for our police officers,” Atkins said. “These are everyday New Yorkers who could be your friends, family and neighbors.”
Most of the pro-police events have been neighborhood-based and organized by local residents, using Facebook and other social media outlets to gain traction. Others have been co-organized by local political groups, such as the Brooklyn Conservative Party, although most organizers try to refrain from discussing politics at their rallies.
The crowds, which are overwhelmingly white, have been a mix of retired officers, their friends and family and other attendees who have said they are rallying support for law and order. Many law enforcement supporters feel local officers have been wrongly vilified since Floyd’s death. The rise of pro-police rallies is also a reaction to legislative efforts to shrink the Police Department.
But the rallies, often known as “Back the Blue” or “Blue Lives Matter” events, have been met by Black Lives Matter backers — racially diverse groups of protesters who are outraged at gatherings that they see as undermining their own cause.
“For pro-cop rallies to come down into the streets and yell ‘white lives matter’ or ‘blue lives matter,’ it almost takes away from the conversation,” said 18-year-old Abdullah Akl, who helped organize a counterprotest in Bay Ridge. “We aren’t fighting against individual police. We are fighting against the institution as a whole and all the racism practices within.”
Organizers of counterprotests have said that they intend their demonstrations to be “a peaceful, nonviolent show of opposition.”
But quelling public anger has proved to be difficult for both sides. This month in Brooklyn, in the Dyker Heights and Bay Ridge neighborhoods, hundreds turned out for pro-police rallies that were interrupted by protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, and tensions quickly escalated in confrontations largely split along racial lines.
At the rally in Bay Ridge, pro-police participants waved American and Thin Blue Line flags and campaign signs for President Donald Trump. Counterprotesters arrived with Black liberation flags and Black Lives Matter banners. Fists and insults flew even as police officers stood between the two groups.
Several people were seen being taken away by officers. The police later said two people were arrested in Bay Ridge, one for throwing a helmet into a crowd and the other for attempted assault.
Days later, a more violent clash took place on the Brooklyn Bridge.
A march of clergy to promote peace was joined by a group of off-duty police officers heading to City Hall Park. Black Lives Matter protesters planned to meet the march halfway. Before the two groups could face off, a few dozen on-duty officers halted the Black Lives Matter protesters.
Again, violence broke out, but this time solely between police and Black Lives Matter protesters. When a protester was being arrested on the bridge, a woman attacked officers with a cane, the police said. Among the targets was Terence Monahan, the Police Department’s chief of department and top uniformed officer, who sprained a finger. Other officers bled from head injuries, and several protesters were injured. The police said 36 people were arrested.
The incidents have each been separate, without a single group organizing all the various “Blue Lives” events, but they share a frustration with the criticism of police behavior and tactics and the calls to defund the police.
The smartphone videos filmed at the events and shared on social media tend to focus on the loudest and most volatile voices in attendance, but others have quietly sought to mobilize backing for law enforcement.
Mary Ziegler, 43, who lives in Burnt Hills, New York, near Schenectady, created a Facebook group to rally support for the police. In a little over a month, the group has grown to over 9,000 members from across the country.
“I would say this movement to ‘Back the Blue’ was galvanized when calls to defund and abolish the police became a very real force in this country,” Ziegler said in an email.
She recently created a Facebook event to organize a pro-police rally in Albany, New York, next month.
Trump has attacked calls to defund the police, labeling the demand a fad. And this month, he criticized New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for allowing “Black Lives Matter” to be painted on the street outside Trump Tower. On Twitter, Trump said the painted motto will “further antagonize New York’s Finest.”
It may have instead inspired them to create their own message: Last week, two police advocacy groups called for a “Blue Lives Matter” painting on a street near 1 Police Plaza in lower Manhattan.
Some pro-police rally attendees insist that their mission is not to antagonize Black Lives Matter protesters. At a recent police rally in Staten Island, Scott LoBaido, 55, told participants the message should be kept positive.
“I emphasized if you’re going to spew anti-BLM rhetoric, that will not be tolerated at this rally,“ he said.
And not everyone in pro-police circles favors the rallies. The Brooklyn Young Republican Club turned down an invitation to the rally in Dyker Heights, according to Joel Acevedo, 25, the president of the organization.
“Good police do not need defending,” Acevedo said. “You can be pro-police and still support accountability to a police system that perpetuates inequities in Black communities. They’re not mutually exclusive.”
The mere presence and timing of the nascent movement — and the “Blue Lives” language — has upset protesters calling for overhaul of policing.
“The logic is nonsense,” said Noah Weston, 35, an activist from Bay Ridge who attended two pro-police rallies as a counterprotester. On Saturday, he was treated at an emergency room after someone kicked him in the groin.
“Blue is their uniform, and they can take it off,” he said. “But Black people can’t stop being Black at their leisure.”
Protesters who want to defund the police said they plan to disrupt future pro-police rallies and are training their members on how to respond to an angry reception.
Some who attended recent counterprotests said police officers were aggressive toward Black Lives Matter protesters while being lenient with pro-police attendees when trying to intervene during confrontations.
Joseph Imperatrice, 35, the founder of the group Blue Lives Matter-NYC, attended the pro-police march in Bayside, Queens, in mid-July where violent confrontations with Black Lives Matter protesters erupted.
The consistency of counterprotests and altercations at pro-cop rallies has made Imperatrice cautious.
“That doesn’t mean I won’t go,” Imperatrice said. “But I’ll definitely think twice.”

NEW YORK — Police officers in riot gear cleared out the “Occupy City Hall” encampment in City Hall Park near dawn Wednesday, shutting down a monthlong demonstration against police brutality that recently had attracted numerous homeless people.
A phalanx of officers in helmets started closing in on dozens of protesters and homeless people shortly before 4 a.m., moving in lock-step behind a wall of plastic shields, according to protesters and videos posted on social media.
Seven people were arrested after sporadic clashes erupted between officers and residents of the camp, officials said. One protester was taken into custody after the police said he threw a brick at an officer.
As the police moved through the camp, officers took down a series of tarps and makeshift tents that demonstrators and several homeless people had been living in for weeks and tossed them into city garbage trucks.
By 8 a.m., city cleaning crews had arrived to scrub anti-police graffiti from sidewalks, subway entrances and the walls of several historic buildings in the area, including the Manhattan Surrogate’s Court across the street from City Hall and the Tweed Courthouse, home of the Department of Education.
The graffiti on the courthouse and other government landmarks — much of it obscene — became a graphic symbol of the continuing unrest in the city. Police officials said the cleanup at and around the protest site could take weeks to finish.
Police union leaders and some local residents complained that the city had waited too long to take the graffiti down.
“The graffiti is just another manifestation of the city in decline,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Cuomo urged city officials to clean it up as quickly as possible, saying, “What does it take? It’s spray paint.”
Speaking to reporters later Wednesday morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the decision to shut down the camp had been made around 10 p.m. Tuesday because of “health and safety.”
“What we saw change over the last few weeks was the gathering there got smaller and smaller, was less and less about protest and more and more of an area where homeless folks were gathering,” the mayor said.
At a separate news conference, Raymond Spinella, the police department’s chief of support services, said that several hundred officers moved into the park at about 3:40 a.m. after giving the protesters camped there a 10-minute warning.
He said the decision to move in Wednesday had been reached with City Hall and was based on the relatively few number of people in the park.
A similar raid was launched almost a decade ago to dismantle the Occupy Wall Street camp in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan.
In November 2011, dozens of officers marched into the park at 1 a.m., rousting protesters who had been there since September and removing their tents, tarps and belongings.
On Wednesday, Yessenia Benitez, 29, of Harlem, said she saw about 100 officers converge on City Hall Park well before sunrise, announcing to protesters that they were breaking the law and ordering them to leave at once.
Most people dispersed, she said, but a small group watched the police operation from Foley Square, a few blocks to the north.
A few protesters said the police had told them that they would be able to return to the park to retrieve their belongings. But when they went back, everything — their water, clothing and personal effects — had been tossed into sanitation trucks, they said.
The occupation began June 23 when about 100 people set up camp on a small patch of grass to the east of City Hall with the mission of bringing pressure on the City Council to cut the New York Police Department’s funding at an upcoming vote before the July 1 budget deadline.
Within a week, the small squatters’ colony grew into a ramshackle community with food service, a hand-sanitizing station and even a library where campers could go to hear lectures on mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline.
Hundreds slept in the park each night, festooning benches and fences with signs denouncing racism and police brutality.
The project reached its peak June 30 when thousands crowded into the plaza after dark to watch the Council vote on a giant video screen. While the Council ultimately decided to shift nearly $1 billion away from the police, many of the protesters expressed disappointment, wanting deeper cuts. Most went home within days.
Those who remained quickly assumed a new responsibility: caring for the dozens of homeless people who had flocked to the site — which protesters started calling Abolition Park — for its free meals, open-air camping and communal sensibility.
While organizers said they felt a duty to tend to some of the city’s most vulnerable residents, problems soon arose. Fights broke out. Passersby were harassed.
Some local residents, even those who said they supported the project’s politics, started to complain that the once-peaceful compound had turned into a shantytown marred by violence and disorder.
The camp, just feet from City Hall, had presented a thorny political problem for de Blasio. He has been routinely criticized by the demonstrators and his Black supporters since the larger, citywide protests, prompted by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, started in late May.
The decision to close the encampment came only days after President Donald Trump sent teams of heavily armed federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal property and to subdue protests there that have turned violent on occasion.
Trump has also threatened to send agents to New York and other cities.
Jawanza James Williams, one of the original organizers of the encampment in June, said the use of hundreds of police officers to disperse several dozen people was “a reminder of why we made the demands we did in the beginning.”
Williams also disputed de Blasio’s argument that the homeless encampment was a health concern, pointing to the Center for Disease Control’s warning that breaking up homeless encampments could risk a spread of the coronavirus. “The park was the safest place for homeless people besides having their own permanent housing,” he said.
Although the occupation at City Hall was over, some protesters said it was not a fatal blow to their cause.
“It’s a reminder that the fight isn’t over, and you know what, I’m glad that they reminded us now,” said Gabe Quinones, 22, who worked at the camp as a volunteer “de-escalator,” settling disputes and soothing frayed tempers. “We’ll go somewhere else with everything that we learned here and continue our work.”
In a sign that some people were not quite ready to give up on City Hall Park altogether, around 300 protesters marched there from Union Square Park on Wednesday in hopes of staging another demonstration.
After being met by barricades and dozens of officers in riot gear, the group marched off into Lower Manhattan, a small armada of police vans not far behind.

Manifestantes en Portland fueron detenidos en las calles sin orden judicial por agentes no identificados. Y se anunció que en Chicago podría suceder lo mismo. ¿Ya podemos llamarlo fascismo?
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times.
Un mes después de la toma de posesión de Donald Trump, un historiador de la Universidad de Yale, Timothy Snyder, publicó el libro superventas Sobre la tiranía: Veinte lecciones que aprender del siglo XX . Fue parte de una pequeña cascada de títulos que tenían la intención de ayudar a los estadounidenses a encontrar su rumbo a medida que el nuevo presidente atacaba la democracia liberal.
Una de las lecciones de Snyder fue: “Desconfía de las fuerzas paramilitares”. Escribió: “Cuando las fuerzas paramilitares partidarias de un líder se entremezclan con la policía y las fuerzas oficiales, ha llegado el final”. En 2017, la idea de agentes no identificados vestidos con camuflaje que se llevaran a personas de izquierda en plena calle sin órdenes de aprehensión podría haber parecido como una fantasía febril de resistencia. Ahora está ocurriendo.
Según una demanda legal presentada el viernes por la fiscala general de Oregón, Ellen Rosenblum, agentes federales “han usado vehículos particulares para manejar por el centro de Portland, detener a manifestantes y subirlos a los vehículos sin identificación de los agentes” desde al menos el martes pasado. Los manifestantes no son arrestados ni se les dice por qué están siendo retenidos.
No hay manera de conocer la afiliación de todos los agentes —han usado uniformes militares con parches que solo dicen “Policía”—, pero The New York Times reportó que algunos de ellos son parte de un grupo de la Patrulla Fronteriza “que normalmente se encarga de investigar a organizaciones de contrabando de droga”.
El gobierno de Trump ha anunciado que tiene la intención de enviar una fuerza similar a otras ciudades; el lunes 20 de julio, el Chicago Tribune reportó planes de desplegar a alrededor de 150 agentes federales en Chicago. “No necesito una invitación del estado”, dijo en Fox News el lunes Chad Wolf, secretario interino del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, y agregó: “Vamos a hacer eso, les guste que estemos ahí o no”.
En Portland, vemos cómo luce una ocupación como esa. Oregon Public Broadcasting reportó el caso de Mark Pettibone, de 29 años, que el miércoles pasado fue detenido en la calle por hombres no identificados, subido de manera apresurada a una miniván sin distintivos de ninguna agencia de seguridad y llevado a una celda en la corte federal. Finalmente, fue liberado sin saber quién lo secuestró.
Un agente federal le disparó en la cabeza a Donavan La Bella, de 26 años, con munición de impacto —un tipo no letal para control de multitudes—; La Bella fue hospitalizado y requirió cirugía reconstructiva. En un video ampliamente difundido, un veterano de la Marina de 53 años fue rociado con gas pimienta y golpeado después de acercarse a agentes federales para preguntarles sobre sus juramentos de defender la Constitución, lo que lo dejó con dos huesos rotos.
Existe algo particularmente aterrador en el uso de los agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza en contra de los disidentes estadounidenses. Después del ataque contra los manifestantes cerca de la Casa Blanca el mes pasado, los militares rechazaron los intentos de Trump de usarlos en contra de los ciudadanos. Los policías de muchas ciudades están dispuestos a violentar a los inconformes, pero ellos están bajo el control de las autoridades locales. Por el contrario, la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por su sigla en inglés) de Estados Unidos está bajo el control de la autoridad federal, tiene líderes que son devotos fanáticos de Trump y está saturada de políticos de extrema derecha.
“No me sorprende que Donald Trump eligió a la CBP para que fuera a Portland e hiciera esto”, me dijo Joaquin Castro, representante demócrata de Texas. “Ha sido una agencia muy problemática en términos de respetar los derechos humanos y la ley”.
Es verdad que la CBP no es una milicia extragubernamental y por ello podría no encajar de manera precisa en el esquema que Snyder presenta en Sobre la tiranía . Sin embargo, cuando hablé con Snyder el lunes, sugirió que la distinción no es tan significativa. “El Estado tiene permiso de usar la fuerza, pero el Estado tiene permiso de usar la fuerza conforme a las reglas”, dijo. Estos agentes, al operar fuera de los papeles que normalmente desempeñan, se comportan, de manera evidente, sin ley.
Snyder señaló que la historia de la autocracia ofrece varios ejemplos de agentes fronterizos usados en contra de enemigos del régimen.
“Esta es una forma clásica en que la violencia ocurre en regímenes autoritarios, ya sea en la España de Franco o en el imperio ruso”, dijo Snyder. “Las personas que están acostumbradas a cometer violencia en la frontera luego son traídas para cometer violencia contra personas en el interior”.
A Castro le preocupa que debido a que los agentes no se identifican a sí mismos, grupos de extrema derecha podrían fácilmente hacerse pasar por ellos para ir en contra de sus enemigos de izquierda. “Se vuelve más probable entre más se use esta táctica”, dijo.
El viernes, la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, tuiteó sobre lo que pasa en Portland: “Trump y sus ‘stormtroopers’ [tropas de asalto] deben ser detenidos” (en una posible referencia a las Camisas Pardas que ayudaron al ascenso al poder de Adolf Hitler). No mencionó qué planea hacer el Congreso para detenerlos, pero la Cámara de Representantes pronto votará en torno a un proyecto de ley de asignaciones de seguridad nacional. Las personas indignadas por las tácticas de Estado policiaco del gobierno deberían exigir, como mínimo, que el Congreso retenga el financiamiento del departamento hasta que esas tácticas sean detenidas.
Durante el gobierno de Trump, ha habido un debate sobre si el autoritarismo del presidente es detenido por su incompetencia. Aquellos que piensan que la preocupación sobre el fascismo es exagerada pueden citar varias instancias en las que el gobierno ha sido criticado después de exceder sus límites. Sin embargo, con demasiada frecuencia, la Casa Blanca ha perseverado, al deformar la vida estadounidense hasta que lo que antes parecía ser la peor situación posible se convierte en el “statu quo”.
Trump ha establecido que sus aliados, como Michael Flynn y Roger Stone, están por encima de la ley. Lo que ocurra ahora nos dirá cuántos de nosotros estamos por debajo de ella.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Shields were made of pool noodles, umbrellas and sleds. The body armor was pieced together with bicycle helmets and football pads. The weapons included water bottles and cigarette lighters.
Facing federal forces who came to Portland to subdue them, many of the city’s protesters have taken to the streets this week with items scrounged from home. Then they have assembled at the federal courthouse each night with sometimes starkly different visions of how to put their tools to use.
In 55 consecutive nights of protest in Portland, no two have been alike. The protests began May 29, following the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. They have continued ever since, night after fiery night, and they show no signs of letting up.
With no clear leaders or blueprints, the demonstrators have largely embraced a strategy of spontaneous consensus, which follows the whims of the crowd and, sometimes, the resolutions of their internal disagreements — such as whether fire is an appropriate addition to their protest.
“It’s really organic and noncentralized,” said Luke Meyer, who walked through the streets overnight with a plywood shield. “You almost vote with your actions.”
With the movement largely without leaders or a consistent strategy, city officials have been unable to find a way to bring the demonstrations to an end. Now those protesters are giving grief to federal agents who were assigned to maintain calm in the city but have instead watched the number of protesters outside the federal courthouse swell into the thousands.
“Whose streets?” they shout, in one of their signature chats. “Our streets. Whose lives matter? Black lives matter.”
The protests have drawn diverse crowds, from teenagers up to grandmothers, from longtime activists to those joining the fray for the first time.
In the early morning hours Wednesday, protesters used a range of tactics. While some spent their time chanting, dancing or locking arms, others slowly chipped away at the temporary wooden facade of the courthouse building, eventually pulling away a whole panel to expose an entryway. Some used lasers or bright lights to shine at holes from which federal officers sometimes fire projectiles into the crowd. Others dragged in barricades to cover the building’s entrances.
The strategy of nuisance has provoked aggressive federal responses that illustrate the type of militarized policing the protesters oppose, sending tear gas and less lethal munitions flying into crowds.
At one point in the protests that raged from late Tuesday into Wednesday, federal agents rushed out of the courthouse and shoved a group of mothers wearing matching yellow shirts as tear gas billowed around them. In another moment, the agents knocked one protester down onto a pole. After clearing a park, the agents rummaged through a makeshift kitchen that has been used to feed the protesters, knocking food and supplies to the ground.
Facing volleys of tear gas that left many coughing, the protesters retreated up Main Street. But they soon regrouped and returned as authorities backed off. In an echo of the “umbrella revolution” in Hong Kong, protesters with shields and umbrellas took the front of the line to protect themselves and others from the weaponry of federal forces in tactical gear.
Authorities have accused protesters of at times using dangerous methods, including launching projectiles from slingshots. In one of dozens of arrests during the demonstrations, a protester was charged recently with hitting an officer with a hammer. The federal efforts to confront the demonstrators in recent days were often preceded by attempts by some protesters to light fires on the facade of the federal courthouse, which has been boarded up with wood that has been painted and targeted by protesters.
On Wednesday morning, someone started trying to light a portion of the facade but was blocked by another person. Later, a debate developed in the crowd over whether to allow the fire, with one protester arguing that being peaceful was the better route.
Megan Smith is among those who opposed the use of fire, saying she douses any flames she encounters.
“I would prefer fires to be controlled,” Smith said. “I get it that it’s how you get your anger out, but it makes it dangerous for everybody else.”
In part, she said, starting a fire raises the risks for everyone because it is clear that it will prompt federal officers to come out to confront the crowds. And Wednesday, it did just that.

Cities Say They Want Federal Agents Fighting Crime, Not Protesters [With graphic(s)]

In recent years, cities like Chicago, Baltimore and New York have turned to Washington for help in combating gun violence and other crimes, arguing that only the federal government has the resources to tackle problems like guns being traded illegally across state borders.
Now as President Donald Trump has threatened to send federal agents to clean up what he called “totally out of control” crime and disorder, some big-city mayors and police officials are pushing back on such federal involvement, suggesting that the president is using their cities as props in a political game.
Portland, Oregon, has become a cautionary tale. Several Democratic mayors have said they don’t want unidentified officers dressed in camouflage patrolling their streets and battling protesters. If the federal government wants to bring resources to bear on violence, said mayors and other officials, it should help with issues like gun crimes, rather than dispatching officers who will make an already tense summer worse.
“The deployment of unnamed special secret agents onto our streets to detain people without cause and to effectively take away their civil rights and civil liberties without due process — that is not going to happen in Chicago,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a news conference Tuesday.
Instead, Lightfoot said, Chicago will be receiving resources from the FBI, the DEA and the ATF, agencies that the city has worked with regularly in the past “to help manage and suppress violent crime in our city.”
It’s this type of help that many mayors say they need.
In Chicago, the deployment will be coordinated with local officials, unlike in Portland where the city’s wishes were ignored, Lightfoot said, adding, “What happened was not only unconstitutional, it was undemocratic.”
The spectacle of Homeland Security agents in unmarked uniforms ringing federal buildings like the courthouse in Portland — and occasionally arresting protesters — in the name of protecting them from nightly vandalism attempts is unusual. But it is common and generally apolitical for local and state police to work hand in hand with law enforcement officials from the Justice Department in combating criminal networks.
In 2017, for example, the Chicago police created a joint strike force to try to reduce the number of guns reaching criminals in the city, consisting of 20 officers each from the Chicago police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Local and federal law enforcement agents also routinely team up on joint task forces across the country with the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration to hunt for terrorism suspects and to investigate drug trafficking networks.
Kansas City, Missouri, has found itself struggling with a wave of shootings this year, and its Police Department asked for federal help.
Rick Smith, the police chief, said that his department had applied for a grant for federal assistance and that officials in Washington quickly offered federal resources. “We said, ‘Of course,’” Smith said. “We’d just come off four homicides, two police officers being shot, a 4-year-old being killed. We were looking for some sort of help, any way we could get it.”
But the city’s mayor, Quinton Lucas, a Democrat, was caught by surprise when Washington suddenly mapped out an entire project called Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, the 4-year-old boy who was killed. Lucas said he learned about the operation on Twitter. He supports receiving help in solving crimes but is worried that the federal agents may end up being used for more intrusive purposes.
“When you have a president of the United States who talks about cities as if they’re his enemies, as if they’re lawless hellscapes, that gives me concern that a federal government-led program may descend into that,” he said. “I fear that there may be an expanded focus.”
More than 200 agents from the FBI, the DEA, the U.S. Marshals Service and the ATF have begun helping with police investigations in Kansas City. The federal prosecutor in Kansas City on Monday promoted the operation’s first arrest and charged a 20-year-old man with being a “drug user in possession of firearms.”
The federal agents will not patrol or help to control protests, Smith said, adding that the city does not need that type of assistance. “It’s a very surgical look at those who are involved in violence,” he said. As of Monday, there had been 110 homicides in Kansas City, 31 more than at the same time a year ago, according to The Kansas City Star. The city is on pace to shatter its previous high of 155 homicides in 2017.
This summer has seen an increase in homicides and shootings in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and elsewhere, including the shooting of 14 people near a Chicago funeral home on Tuesday. Combined with continuing protests over police violence prompted by the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, the violence has left many cities on edge. Even with violent crime down overall, some statistics are startling.
In New York City, there were 42 homicides in the 28 days before July 19, and 323 shootings. That is an increase of more than 13% for homicides and 199% for shootings during the same period the previous year, said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who analyzes crime statistics.
In Chicago, there were 116 homicides over those 28 days, nearly a 200% increase, while there were 559 shootings, up more than 100%, he said.
Trump’s threats to deploy federal agents to address urban unrest echo those he made earlier in his administration, which some critics — then and now — have dismissed as posturing.
“This president blusters and bluffs and says he’s going to do things, and they never materialize on a regular basis,” Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said at a news conference on Tuesday. “So first we should not overrate his statements — they are so often not true.”
Detroit’s leaders have unequivocally rejected Trump’s proposal to send in federal law enforcement agents to quell protests.
“Detroit, unlike New York, unlike Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, just to name a few cities, didn’t have looting, buildings being burned,” said Chief James Craig of the Detroit Police Department. “We have not experienced the same level of violence, and that was handled by the Detroit Police Department and our community.”
The city has struggled with crime this year, seeing a 7% uptick in violent crime, Craig said. Detroit is part of Operation Relentless Pursuit, a Justice Department program started in December that provides additional federal law enforcement personnel and resources to help cities tackle crime. Craig said that he welcomed that support but that it was not to be confused with Trump’s suggestion that federal agents be sent to quell protests.
It’s not just cities led by Democrats that are struggling. In Jacksonville, Florida, where the Republican National Convention will be held next month, the city’s Republican mayor, Lenny Curry, said at a news conference Tuesday that there was no need for federal law enforcement to help calm violent protests in his city because local police had been more aggressive. Still, the city is facing one of its deadliest years in decades, with more than 100 homicides as of Monday, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.
In Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney said he opposed any federal intervention in response to the protests. And Larry Krasner, the city’s progressive district attorney, said in a statement Monday that he would prosecute anyone, including federal agents, who broke the law by assaulting or kidnapping people.
Lightfoot said that she did not expect a Portland-style deployment in Chicago. Still, she cautioned residents that if the situation changed and they saw anything similar to Portland, they should call her office or 911.
In Oakland, California, Mayor Libby Schaaf, a Democrat, has accused Trump of trying to distract people from the abysmal job the federal government has done in containing the coronavirus.
“I don’t need law enforcement in Oakland,” Schaaf said. “I need testing, I need personal protective equipment, we need direct income support for people who are out of work, that’s what we need. This president seems to confuse a political bent — obviously Oakland is a proud diverse, progressive city, and that is not a mess, nor is it hell.”
Yet, regular cooperation hasn’t always worked.
In Chicago this year, the police have already confiscated 5,296 guns, Lightfoot said. Still, she said, the ATF is too constrained by the gun lobby to tackle serious problems like guns pouring into Chicago from Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere.
Analysts also say there has never been a public reckoning of what was accomplished by the cooperation between the Chicago police and the ATF in the Crime Gun Strike Force.
“It was pure theater,” said Tracy Siska, the founder and director of the Chicago Justice Project, which tracks criminal justice issues. “It was Trump playing to his base to show them that he was being tough.”
The real issues behind the crime and unrest — poverty, segregation, racism — are never addressed, he said.
Federal agents who are deployed in Portland lack training in crowd control and other police tactics, analysts noted. It would be even harder for them to operate in Chicago, a far larger city with entrenched gang activity, they said.
“It is hard to believe that 150 federal agents out on the street will have much public safety benefit,” said Jens Ludwig, director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, adding that it would just “pour gasoline on a lot of the tensions that we currently have in cities all across the country.”

MIAMI — Andrew Gillum sounded like a prophet. His words quick, his tone urgent, the man who nearly became Florida’s governor predicted in a podcast interview that the coronavirus would cripple the state’s tourism industry, hide in nursing homes and proliferate amid rampant misinformation.
It was a Thursday afternoon in early March. Several of his predictions would prove true: Florida now battles a dangerous surge in virus cases. But hours after the interview, police would be summoned to a Miami Beach hotel room after a 911 call, and Gillum’s promising political career would begin to unravel.
He was found by police shortly after midnight vomiting on the bathroom floor of Room 1107 at the Mondrian South Beach. Another man had been struggling to breathe after a possible drug overdose.
Prescription pills were spilled on the carpet. Police identified three clear plastic bags of what they suspected was crystal methamphetamine.
“Mr. Gillum was unable to communicate with officers due to his inebriated state,” the police report said.
Gillum, the 40-year-old former mayor of Tallahassee, denied using methamphetamines and apologized for being drunk. He called the other man a friend. Quick internet searches showed that the man was also an escort. Two days later, Gillum said he would check himself into rehab for alcoholism and depression.
It was a stunning and swift fall for one of the Democratic Party’s brightest young political stars. One moment, his name was floated as a contender for the 2020 vice presidential nomination. The next, his lawyer was battling leaked hotel room photographs of Gillum naked on the floor. Still, as Gov. Ron DeSantis in recent months resisted a few basic ways to control the pandemic, some in Florida wondered about a different fate for the state had Gillum won in 2018.
On Monday, Gillum surfaced for the first time since the hotel room incident to say he had left rehab and embraced talk therapy.
“I totally underestimated the impact that losing the race for governor had on my life,” said Gillum, who for months had been unavailable for comment, in an 11-minute video on Instagram. “I didn’t want to talk emotionally or really deeply about what happened in the race for governor because it was a constant reminder of failure and my own personal failures.”
How exactly Gillum lost his way in the 16 months between his high-profile loss and that night in the hotel room might be known only to him. What was evident to those around him — and he said as much in his video — was that his life was packed with commitments that pulled him away from his family and left him little time to rest. All that, his friends believe, may have clouded his judgment.
“What’s being portrayed — I don’t know that Andrew,” state Rep. Shevrin D. Jones, a friend since college who texted Gillum the day after the Miami Beach incident to offer support, said before Gillum left rehab. “I’ve known Andrew for almost 20 years, and I’ve never known Andrew to have a drinking or a drug problem.”
With few satisfying answers while their old boss was in treatment, Gillum’s former campaign operatives deployed a line he used to give about felons fighting for their voting rights: “Nobody should be judged forever on their worst day.”
Gillum’s 2018 campaign never really ended. After he conceded the race twice — first on election night, then after a recount confirmed he had lost to DeSantis by about 32,000 votes — Gillum threw himself into growing a voter-registration organization, fundraising for the Democratic Party and commentating for CNN.
Had he become Florida’s first African American governor, a young Democrat leading a Southern state and the nation’s biggest presidential battleground, speculation about Gillum’s future would have included the White House. Instead, he was left to inhabit the purgatory of ambitious politicians who lose and have no obvious public role to keep them relevant until the next election.
“Losing hurts,” said state Sen. Oscar Braynon II, a friend. “And he lost on a big scale. That can do a number on people.”
Beto O’Rourke journaled and drove across the plains before running for president. Stacey Abrams focused on fighting voter suppression and has been making the case for why she should be Joe Biden’s running mate.
Gillum, against the advice of some close to him, did not take a post-campaign break. He was often far from his Tallahassee home and away from his wife and their three young children. His father, an alcoholic with whom he had a complicated relationship, died in February 2019.
In a state with a thin Democratic bench, Gillum was the rare figure who could attract Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters. He felt he had created a movement and was obligated to grow it, said Christopher Chestnut, Gillum's best friend since high school.
Chestnut recalled a breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in Tallahassee a few weeks after Gillum’s concessions. People kept interrupting them.
“I remember early on in the primary people not answering the phone, not taking a meeting, standing us up for meetings,” Chestnut said. “Now Democrats, Republicans, white people, Black people were coming up, telling him they voted for him.”
Some Democrats suggested that Gillum push to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Others urged him to work toward a state assault weapons ban. Gillum chose to register voters, especially African Americans and Hispanics.
Expanding the base could not only help the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 but also Gillum if he ran against Sen. Marco Rubio in 2022 as some staff members hoped.
The private sector was not appealing for someone in political office since age 23. But Gillum needed the money and exposure, so he took paid speaking engagements and the CNN gig. The deeper into the presidential primary, the more he appeared from debate halls and New York and Washington studios.
“As a Black man in politics, we don’t have the luxury to sit on the sidelines,” said Bakari Sellers, a CNN commentator and former South Carolina state legislator. “Because too many people depend on you. Not just personally, but when you lose that race, you feel like you let people down who stood in front of you.”
Gillum’s organization, Forward Florida, pledged to register or reactivate 1 million voters by the 2020 presidential election. It began with nearly $3 million in the bank that Gillum’s campaign had not spent before Election Day, in part because the airwaves were saturated.
But the unspent cash bothered John Morgan, an Orlando lawyer and influential Democratic donor whose firm had contributed $250,000. Morgan texted Gillum last year, urging him to use the leftover funds to pay off felons’ fines so thousands of them could become eligible to vote. Morgan then went after Gillum on Twitter: “Give it to charity not yourself.”
Shortly after, The Tampa Bay Times revealed that Forward Florida — along with Gillum’s campaign, one of his former employers, a wealthy Gillum donor and others — had been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury in March 2019 for a number of records dating back to 2015. Gillum was not subpoenaed, and no charges have been filed.
It was not the first time Gillum had come within the gaze of federal investigators. As Tallahassee mayor in 2016, he took a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty with a lobbyist who paid for the trip and with two developers who were actually undercover FBI agents investigating possible City Hall corruption. The incident clouded his 2018 campaign, and Gillum, who was never criminally charged, paid a $5,000 state ethics fine last year for accepting the lobbyist’s gift.
By July 2019, Forward Florida had transferred its work to a newly created sister organization, Forward Florida Action. Unlike the political committee, the new organization’s nonprofit status allowed it to keep financial records secret. Morgan called it a “slush fund.”
“I don’t live on your plantation,” Gillum responded. (“What Andrew does any time you criticize him is makes it a race issue,” Morgan, who is white, said in an interview.)
The Forward Florida political committee has spent about $1 million on legal fees since March 2019 to two big firms, Stearns Weaver Miller and Perkins Coie, that are handling the federal investigation, according to financial disclosure reports.
Forward Florida Action, the nonprofit group, says it has raised over $1 million for more than a half-dozen partner organizations that have registered some 200,000 people, about one-fifth of the goal.
The legal and financial wrangling did not lower Gillum’s profile. He arrived with a small entourage when he headlined a Miami fundraiser in September for Jones, the state representative. He gave a keynote address at a commemoration for Martin Luther King Jr. at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. He drew laughs on “Real Time With Bill Maher.”
Then he traveled to Miami with his wife, R. Jai, for a long weekend in March to officiate the wedding of some friends.
Before he was found disoriented in the hotel room, he recorded an episode for the podcast “Campaign HQ” with David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.
Gillum demanded that the nation’s leaders rise to the gravity of the pandemic. He pleaded to bolster public safety nets. He rejected the notion that Florida might have turned irreversibly red and challenged progressives to organize before the presidential election in November.
“Man,” Plouffe said, “I wish you were elected governor of Florida, Andrew.”
On Monday, Gillum acknowledged that he felt guilt and shame over the hotel room incident. “My stuff had to be public and cause great embarrassment and rumors, some false, some true,” he said in the Instagram video. He thanked his wife, adding that she “knows everything that I am and everything that I am not. And she chooses to love me anyhow.”
And he said it had been difficult to be away during the pandemic — his mother fought the coronavirus for a month — and during nationwide protests against police brutality and racism.
“I know as a Black man what it means just to have to convince people that your life has meaning, convince people that your life has purpose,” he said. “This is a tough moment not to be out in the world and contributing.”

PORTLAND, Ore. — With a ski helmet and goggles on her head, Allison Hyder said she had told her family members that she planned to stand at the rear of protests in downtown Portland. But, in the early hours of Tuesday, the grandmother of five found herself right up front, locking arms with other mothers dressed in yellow.
Standing with a pack of other protesters, she chanted in front of the boarded-up entrance to the federal courthouse. Even as some in the crowd began prying at the wood affixed to the building, leaving Hyder uneasy about where things were headed, she remained resolute.
“I am the face of anarchy,” Hyder said. “The people of the U.S. need to know that moms, grandmas and nurses are out here in the middle of the night demanding rights for everybody.”
The demonstrations that have shuddered through Portland for 54 consecutive days have drawn out a complicated mix of emotions and grievances, and an array of people who are expressing them.
In a state with a deep history of racial-exclusion laws and a spirited protest tradition, the Portland protests have persisted since George Floyd’s killing even as Black Lives Matter demonstrations have waned in parts of the country.
But some leaders in the Black community, grateful for a reckoning on race, worry that what should be a moment for racial justice could be squandered by violence. Businesses supportive of change have been left demoralized by the mayhem the protests have brought. The city’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, despised by many of the protesters, has now been fighting to have federal officers leave them alone.
Amid the Gordian knot of grievances and escalations, most everyone seems to agree about one thing: The combative deployment of camouflaged federal agents has only made things worse.
President Donald Trump, in pushing a law-and-order message for his reelection campaign, has embraced a dark vision of Portland as a lawless place filled with people who “hate our country.” His administration’s crackdown has brought armed officers from a wide variety of federal agencies to the streets, where they have been firing tear gas and pulling protesters into unmarked vans.
The president’s portrayal of Portland and the crackdown he has unleashed have infuriated protesters who see Trump as trying to use the city’s unrest as political theater during an election year. They say he is forcing a federal police presence on a city that doesn’t want it — a city with such a rich tradition of protest that an aide to another Republican president, George Bush, reportedly referred to it as Little Beirut.
While the protests have consumed parts of downtown at nighttime, much of the city has been left untouched. By day, boaters putter up the Willamette River while joggers run down the trail alongside it. On Monday evening, large groups of diners were eating on outdoor patios a few blocks away from the county’s Justice Center, where protesters were amassing for the night.
To the protesters, the president’s unusual deployment of federal power has provided yet more compelling evidence that their fears about rising fascism in the United States are justified.
In the Portland area, activists aligned with the loosely-organized group known as antifa have long denounced police militarization and a punishing criminal justice system, and have clashed with the police in recent years. The protests of the last seven weeks developed a near-nightly cycle of conflict between protesters and local police, with officers reacting to objects being thrown by protesters and protesters expressing alarm by the use of tear gas that impacted peaceful people.
Reflecting an oft-heard refrain, Angel Almanza, 44, said a government can only suppress people so much before they will respond in kind.
“This has been an act of self-defense,” Almanza said.
The strife on the streets escalated with the arrival of federal forces, which have relied heavily on tear gas, munitions fired from paintball-style guns and batons.
Among the others concerned by the federal crackdown was Joey Gibson, a far-right activist who has long battled with Portland’s antifa demonstrators. He said he found it somewhat frightening to see video of one officer whacking a Navy veteran with a baton, and he worried that the Trump administration was setting a precedent that would encourage other presidents to embrace a more expansive use of federal forces.
“It is very concerning,” Gibson said.
On Tuesday morning, dozens of agents moved around the streets and at times threw people to the ground to detain them. As federal officers appeared to try detaining one person, others in the crowd rushed to free the person.
Portland authorities have cited ongoing troubles with the protesters, and on Tuesday police said a jewelry store had been looted.
The nightly protests have also alarmed businesses in downtown, who were first hit with widespread looting in the aftermath of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on Memorial Day and have struggled to navigate the weeks since. Stacey Gibson, who owns a Subway sandwich shop downtown, said the store’s windows have been boarded up much of the time, which has contributed to shrinking sales already limited by the coronavirus and related lockdowns.
Gibson said she was frustrated at a Police Department which she said cannot respond when there is a problem and at city leaders who have been unable to find a resolution. She is not optimistic about the future of her store, either.
“At this point, I’m just trying to figure out how to get out and to minimize the damage,” Gibson said.
The protests after Floyd’s death drew thousands to the streets in Portland, creating powerful images of crowds lying face down on the Burnside Bridge in honor of Floyd.
While the numbers dwindled over the subsequent weeks and Gov. Kate Brown expressed a belief that things were beginning to cool off, the crowds have surged back in recent days, with protesters chanting “Feds go home” and focusing much of their ire on the federal courthouse building.
The demonstrations have continued to have a strong component of calls for racial justice, including on Monday night, when thousands chanted “Black Lives Matter” and young Black activists led the predominantly white crowd in speeches and song.
But some Black leaders have grown wary of the persistent unrest. Pastor J.W. Matt Hennessee, who has participated in demonstrations and considers this a hopeful moment for racial reconciliation, said he worries that the disruptive elements of the protests may be pulling the focus away from racial justice.
“In many ways it has distracted from the message of early June,” he said. He called on protesters to meet to discuss a path forward and help find a resolution.
The mayor and the governor have both called on federal forces to leave in order to ease tensions and give the city space to resolve the differences.

Protesters, some of whom identify with the loosely organized group known as antifa, see the unusual deployment of federal power as compelling evidence that their fears about rising fascism in the United States are justified.
On the streets, the scenes can resemble mayhem.

Minneapolis Police Experience Surge of Departures in Aftermath of George Floyd Protests [With graphic(s)]

MINNEAPOLIS — Nearly two months after four of its officers were charged with killing George Floyd, the Minneapolis Police Department is reeling, with police officers leaving the job in large numbers, crime surging and politicians planning a top-to-bottom overhaul of the force.
Veteran officers say that morale within the department is lower than they have ever experienced. Some officers are scaling back their policing efforts, concerned that any contentious interactions on the street could land them in trouble. And many others are calling it quits altogether.
“It’s almost like a nuclear bomb hit the city, and the people who didn’t perish are standing around,” Officer Rich Walker Sr., a 16-year Minneapolis police veteran and union official, said of the mood within the department. “I’m still surprised that we’ve got cops showing up to work, to be honest.”
Many American police departments have faced challenges in retention and recruitment in recent years amid growing criticism of police abuses. But the woes in Minneapolis and elsewhere have only grown since May, when Floyd was killed after the police detained him.
Nearly 200 officers have applied to leave the Minneapolis Police Department because of what they describe as post-traumatic stress, said Ronald F. Meuser Jr., a lawyer representing the officers. The prospect that a department of about 850 could lose about 20% of its force in the coming months has prompted major concern.
Already, about 65 officers have left the department this year, surpassing the typical attrition rate of 45 a year, Chief Medaria Arradondo told the City Council during a meeting last week. Dozens of other officers have taken temporary leave since Floyd’s death, complicating the staffing picture.
Minneapolis’ police force has long had a troubled relationship with the community. Excessive force complaints against Minneapolis officers have become commonplace, especially by Black residents. African Americans account for about 20% of the city’s population, but they are more likely to be pulled over, arrested and have force used against them than white residents.
Cmdr. Scott Gerlicher, head of the Special Operations and Intelligence Division, wrote in an email to supervisors this month that, “Due to significant staffing losses of late,” the department was “looking at all options” for responding to calls, including shift, schedule and organizational changes.
The email, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, also said the department would not “be going back to business as usual.” The guiding principle going forward, Gerlicher wrote, would be to “do no harm,” and he highlighted potential reforms, including, “Looking for reasonable and safe alternatives to police services in some areas.”
“Front line supervisors play the most critical role in making meaningful changes,” he wrote. “Don’t take this lightly.”
With fewer officers to patrol, some of those on the streets find themselves stretched thin and working longer hours. Complaints about the lack of support from politicians, community members and even department commanders are part of the daily conversation in precincts and squad cars.
For years, police departments nationwide have faced a workforce crisis, according to a report published last year by the Police Executive Research Forum. In a survey of more than 400 departments nationwide, the forum found that 63% of them saw a slight or significant decrease in the number of applicants over the previous five years, 41% had growing staff shortages and nearly half reported that officer tenures were decreasing.
The current climate differs from six years ago — when the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked national unrest — in that the demands are not just to reform police departments, but to get rid of them, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the forum.
Many activists see an overdue reckoning for an institution that they say has long gotten away with brutalizing people of color with impunity.
“Policing as an institution has largely been untouchable, despite the many, many, many failings that are cultural,” said Jeremiah Ellison, a Minneapolis City Council member who supports defunding the police. “Here we are in a moment where people all over the country are saying, ‘No, no, no, no, no, we are interested in real accountability.’”
Instead of embracing change, Ellison added, the police are saying, “You’re picking on us, you don’t know how hard our job is and we’re going home.”
Several officers in Minneapolis said they felt like they all were being stereotyped because of Derek Chauvin, the white former officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes before Floyd died.
“If anything has the propensity to have a violent interaction, we already know we’re judged before they even hear the facts,” said Walker, whose stop of a motorist 11 years ago led to a lawsuit that the city settled for $235,000 after several responding officers punched and kicked the driver in an episode captured on video.
To Sasha Cotton, director of the Office of Violence Prevention in Minneapolis, there is a cruel irony to officers saying they feel stereotyped. Her office regularly works with Black men and boys to try to keep them out of violence.
“Our officers are experiencing what so often our young men and boys, who we service through the program, say they feel,” she said. “They feel like they are being judged based on the behavior of some of their peers.”
Minneapolis officers say that much of their frustration is rooted in an uncertainty over what comes next. A majority of City Council members have pledged to defund the Police Department, and they are currently in the process of trying to replace the agency with a new public safety department.
Many officers say they feel like city leaders and some residents have turned their backs on them, making them less inclined to go “above and beyond what they need to do,” said Walker, the union official.
“Cops have not been to the work level of before, but it’s not a slowdown,” he added. “They’re just not being as proactive because they know they’re not supported in case something bad happens.”
Officers said they were also concerned about their job security.
Sgt. Anna Hedberg, a 14-year Minneapolis police veteran and board member of the Minneapolis Police Federation, the union representing officers, said a colleague recently told her he had another job opportunity. He has been on the force for six years, but it takes 10 years to be fully vested in his pension, so he was unsure whether he should leave.
“I told him to leave because he’s not happy,” Hedberg said.
The tensions between the city and its Police Department come as crime is on the rise. There have been 16 homicides since June 1, more than twice as many as during the same period last year. Violent crime is up by 20% compared with the same stretch a year ago. Experts say there are many reasons for the spike, not just police staffing levels.
Alondra Cano, a City Council member who supports defunding the police, said that any change to the department would take time and that officers would not lose their jobs overnight. It would be better for everyone — officers included — if they worked together toward a transition, she said.
“I would prefer that people don’t resort to those extreme decisions of quitting or collecting a paycheck but not responding to calls,” she said.
For one senior officer on leave because of PTSD symptoms, the problems started when he could not sleep after long nights of work during the unrest following Floyd’s death. Eventually he got headaches, he said, and lost his appetite and desire to do anything.
“We were stepchildren. We were abandoned,” said the officer, who asked that his name be withheld because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
He saw a therapist, who told him he should take time off. He is torn about whether he will return.
“I’m coming back to chaos,” he said. “I’m coming back to no leadership. I’m coming back to an administration that doesn’t care about the officers. I’m coming back to a City Council that doesn’t want us here. I’m coming back to a family, or a community, that doesn’t want me here. Why do I want to come back to that?”
Many officers are on edge in part because they believe that Arradondo and other senior department leaders have not provided clear direction to the rank and file, Hedberg said.
“They’re waking up the next day: ‘Is it going to be the day I get transferred? Is it the day my unit’s going to be dissolved?’” she said. “People are concerned about it.”
John Elder, a spokesman for the department, said in an email: “We have not heard those complaints; in fact I have received compliments from staff about the support from the front office.”
While many officers express anxiety about the future, Officer Charles Adams III said he supported the efforts of Arradondo, the first Black officer to lead the force.
Although Adams has felt unsupported by the community and demoralized at times — especially after he was removed from his job as a school resource officer when the school district ended its contract with the Police Department — he said thoughts of leaving the force never crossed his mind.
“Now is not the time for us to run away,” said Adams, a 19-year veteran and native of the city’s predominantly Black North Side.
“I’m a Black face. I can be out there,” he added. “I wear blue, but let’s talk: ‘What do you want to see done? How can I help you?’ I think it’s my opportunity to give people what they’ve been asking for.”

ADAMS, Wis. — Nate Zimdars, a Democratic candidate for the Wisconsin state Assembly, arrived at the VFW lodge in Adams, Wisconsin, after marching in the local Independence Day parade, ready to meet voters at an annual outdoor chicken cookout called the “Chic Nic.” Although the event was hosted by the local Republican Party, Zimdars was far from nervous being behind enemy lines. He was eager.
The county flipped from blue to red in 2016, Zimdars noted, which meant it could flip again. Plus, national Democrats had done him a favor: They chose former Vice President Joe Biden for the top of their ticket.
“Biden comes across as someone who’s moderate and has experience on both sides of the aisle,” Zimdars said. “My close family and friends, who are a little more on the Republican side of the fence, said if Biden became the nominee, they would vote for him.”
Such persuasion is at the core of Biden’s campaign strategy, designed to bring together moderates, older adults, working-class voters across races and former supporters of President Donald Trump. The approach has helped him jump out to an early lead in polling, both in national surveys and in swing states like Wisconsin, where Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. It has also helped Biden fend off attacks from Trump, who has sought to cast Biden as a radical progressive despite his lengthy career as a moderate lawmaker.
But if Biden hopes to maintain his advantage as November draws near, Wisconsin Democrats like Zimdars have some advice, akin to the famous medical principle of “do no harm” or the cautionary words of the hit HBO series “The Wire”: “Keep it boring.”
Being politically milquetoast is Biden’s appeal, they said, driving his ability to attract progressives in Milwaukee, moderates in suburbs like Waukesha and more rural voters in places like Adams County, one of the 22 counties in the state that voted for Trump after backing President Barack Obama in 2012.
They don’t lament that Biden is not a historic candidate like Obama or Hillary Clinton, or that he lacks bumper-sticker progressive policies like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders; they’re grateful for it.
After the 2016 election, Clinton was lambasted for running a risk-averse campaign that seemed to rely on voters finding Trump’s conduct inherently repugnant. Four years later, facing a changed electoral landscape, many Wisconsin Democrats think Biden can win the state with that exact playbook.
Biden is “the perfect candidate for this area at this time,” said Matt Mareno, chair of the Waukesha Democratic Party.
“Trump’s whole rallying cry was that he was an outsider coming to fix the establishment, and now he is the establishment,” Mareno said. “We’re seeing more and more college-educated white voters leaving him, and we’re seeing more seniors leave him. We’re seeing that coalition just completely dissolved down to the very core base of his support.”
Several characteristics inform Biden’s strategy, including his lengthy career as a bipartisan legislator, Trump’s panned response to the pandemic and Biden’s identity as an older white man, the type of politician easily categorized as “presidential.”
There are a range of ways Biden can build a general election coalition in a battleground state like Wisconsin.
He could focus on winning back voters in low-population areas, where Clinton suffered big losses in 2016.
He could build on recent Democratic efforts to target the college-educated white voters that Trump has, at times, repelled, particularly in suburban counties like Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, where Clinton outperformed Obama but also lost some votes to third-party candidates.
Or he could seek to motivate reliable Democratic voters like young people, Black voters and Latino voters in Milwaukee, the Democratic stronghold where voter turnout was down significantly in 2016.
Biden’s advisers said he will seek to both appeal to persuadable voters and motivate the party’s base, mimicking the successful campaign of Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, a progressive who won reelection in 2018 by an eye-popping 10 points. Biden led Trump by 11 points in Wisconsin in a poll by The New York Times and Siena College last month, and more recent polling from other battleground states like Pennsylvania has been even better for him.
Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat who represents Madison, said Biden’s campaign had already outpaced Clinton’s in terms of investment in and attention to Wisconsin. Pocan said the Clinton campaign “took the purple state for granted,” citing both a lack of visits and financial support for down-ballot candidates.
“Donald Trump came and lied to us, but at least he showed up,” he said, calling the Democrats’ losses in 2016 a “duh moment” for the party. It was Democratic voter drop-off across Wisconsin — not big Republican turnout — that most helped Trump win there, he said.
“When one candidate doesn’t campaign and the other one does, you would expect that you might get the results that we got,” Pocan said. “But no one will ever make that mistake again.”
This does not mean that Biden has avoided skepticism from core Democratic constituencies like young people and progressive minority voters — the same groups that frequently needled Clinton and backed Biden’s rivals in the primary.
In fact, the same polls that show Biden securely ahead of Trump also find Biden with tepid numbers among young people and minority voters. His favorability rating decreased in a recent survey by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, driven by shifts among younger Democrats.
At a protest in Milwaukee in support of Black Lives Matter this month, Larissa Gladding, 23, said she viewed voting for Biden as the unfortunate cost of beating Trump. “It doesn’t even feel like it’s an election about young people or he wants the young vote anymore,” she said, adding that she planned to vote for Biden anyway.
Dominique Tonneas, 24, who was interviewed at a fireworks show in Muskego and who plans to vote for Trump in November, said Biden’s age and long career meant he wouldn’t bring a new perspective to the table. She said she planned to vote for Trump, who is only a few years younger, because she preferred his economic policies.
What is already clear: The last several months, which have featured the largest protest movement in U.S. history and a pandemic that continues to kill thousands and upend the country’s social and economic fabric, have forced Biden and Trump to adjust the structure and the message of their campaigns.
Sue Schaetzka, who attended the Chic Nic in Adams, said she voted for Trump in 2016 and planned to do so again in November. But she said the events of the past few months, and particularly the nation’s response to the coronavirus, had changed the way people in her social circles felt about the president.
Schaetzka was unsure Trump could win the state again this year, particularly against a Democrat like Biden.
“With everything that’s going on with COVID, I know some people are rethinking,” Schaetzka said.
“People just like Biden more than they like Hillary,” she added. “I don’t know if it’s her past and all that, but they didn’t trust her.”
At the protest in Milwaukee, young liberals said they planned to vote for Biden, but the exact things that help him appeal to people like Schaetzka are what makes them begrudging, even resentful, supporters.
They portrayed Biden as too moderate ideologically and as a doddering elder personally, a critique that mimics the “Sleepy Joe” moniker Trump has sought to popularize.
Diarelis Rodriguez, who marched in the protest, said she understood the young people who saw Biden and Trump as two sides of the same coin.
“Biden is part of the problem. He helped with the War on Drugs and doesn’t really understand the issues we need him to,” said Rodriguez, 18. “The people I talk to don’t want to vote because they don’t want to participate in a corrupt system.”
But Rodriguez still said she planned to vote for Biden in November, though both she and Gladding wished he embraced more activist rhetoric on matters of racial equality and defunding police.
There’s a reason he has not. Twenty miles away, leaders of the Waukesha Democratic Party said they recently fielded a phone call from a skeptical voter who said she wanted to vote for Biden, but she was worried Democrats were becoming hostile to police officers.
A volunteer named Scott Prindl called the woman back. Prindl, 65, said the woman had family in law enforcement, and he does also. During the phone call, he explained the Black Lives Matter movement and its goals, as he saw them.
“The real Black Lives Matter protests are the ones who are peaceful,” Prindl, who is white, assured the woman over the phone. “It’s outsiders who are coming in and wreaking havoc,” he said, alluding to the destructive political groups that protesters said turned some of the demonstrations violent.
The woman was comforted. She will be voting for Democrats in November, she said, and for Biden over Trump.

NEW YORK — On Saturday, March 28, Dawn Kelly got the phone call summoning her to the hospital to say goodbye to her husband, Larry. A palliative care social worker was pressing her to think about what her husband would want.
In other words, Larry wasn’t going to make it. They needed her permission to take him off life support. Dawn’s knees gave way; she grabbed the kitchen counter so she wouldn’t fall.
Dawn last saw Larry 11 days earlier, in their apartment on the Upper West Side, on March 17 at 5 a.m. Barely able to walk, he asked her to help him get into clean underwear before the ambulance arrived. He texted her one last time from the hospital before he was put on a ventilator, which required being put into a drug-induced coma: “I promise I’ll never stop fighting.”
Larry didn’t have a living will; he’d kept putting it off. “What would he want?” Dawn replied to the social worker. “He’d want to live.”
“Go Get Tested. You Probably Have It”
Lawrence Kelly’s was an early case of COVID-19 in New York. The week he got sick, the first virus-related death was reported in the city. With Westchester County and Bergen County, New Jersey, emerging as East Coast epicenters of the disease, Mayor Bill de Blasio was in the process of shutting down the schools. Gov. Andrew Cuomo canceled the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. New York hospitals were bracing for the onslaught.
Larry hadn’t been feeling well for about a week, and Dawn had been getting annoyed.
“Go get tested,” she urged him. “You probably have it.” She was a special-education teacher at PS 131 in Brooklyn, a magnet school for the performing arts, and she was busy with her students.
Larry, 64, had retired a few years earlier from his career in the New York City public school system. His 28-year-old daughter Jackie, the younger of his two daughters, had moved home temporarily, and she was also feeling sick. The two of them went for coronavirus tests at an urgent care clinic March 12 while Dawn was at her school in Brooklyn, training to teach remotely.
Both Jackie and Larry felt rotten, but Larry’s symptoms — cough, chills, fever, labored breathing — were far worse, bad enough that the urgent care doctor sent him directly to the emergency room.
The doctors kept him overnight, then sent him home with a prescription for antibiotics. Larry’s brother Danny, who lives a few blocks away, filled the prescription and delivered Gatorade to the apartment, where Larry had moved to the foldout couch in the living room to try to keep from infecting Dawn. By the morning of the 17th, Larry and Jackie still hadn’t been notified of their test results. Jackie seemed to be coping, but Larry had become so sick and weak that he was terrified, and he called 911.
As they waited for the ambulance, Larry had a lot of advice for Dawn, as usual. He was obsessing about alternate-side-of-the-street parking; he had found a perfect spot he didn’t want Dawn to lose. (The next day, the parking rule was suspended and stayed so for months.) He told her to check the mail. He had always paid the bills; he tried to give her a crash course on the family finances. He showed her where the life insurance policies were. “You’ll need 12 death certificates,” he instructed her.
The paramedics arrived, and somehow they knew the results of Larry’s coronavirus test. “He has it,” they told Dawn. As they took Larry, masked with oxygen, to the ambulance, he raised his hand to wave goodbye.
The Sickest Patient They Had
Jessica Montanaro was the nurse on duty at Mount Sinai Morningside when Larry arrived. She had been a nurse for 18 years, five of those as a nursing coordinator in the ICU at Mount Sinai. Since February, the staff in the 24-bed unit had been getting ready for coronavirus patients, practicing donning and doffing their protective gear and preparing negative pressure rooms, typically used for airborne viruses.
Larry was the first patient she admitted who was alert. “He kept asking me over and over if I was going to help him breathe,” she remembered. “But he could still smile. When Jackie called and told him she had tested positive, his whole focus shifted.”
In that instant Jessica herself felt fear. “I was suddenly acutely aware that despite the PPE, this was a deadly airborne virus we didn’t know very much about, and I was sitting in a room with a very sick patient. I couldn’t let on that I was nervous, but I was. Now, the disease is scary,” she said. “Then, it was terrifying.”
Larry was put on BiPap, a noninvasive breathing machine that helps a patient breathe through a mask. Jessica had the following day off. The next time she saw Larry, two days later, his condition had deteriorated so precipitously that he had been intubated — a tube inserted down his throat — and put into a medically induced coma. A ventilator was breathing for him.
On March 20, Danny tried to visit his brother in the hospital. COVID-19 was still so new in the city he didn’t yet realize that no visitors were allowed. “How can patients get better if they don’t have loved ones by their hospital beds giving them the energy they need to fight?” he wondered. A guard in the lobby called the ICU, and a doctor came down to talk to Danny. Larry was the sickest patient they had, she said. Danny didn’t tell that to Dawn and Jackie.
That day there were more than 4,000 new confirmed cases in New York City; 665 people were hospitalized, and 47 people died. Cuomo ordered half of the workforce to stay home. The only exceptions were those employed by essential businesses like pharmacies and groceries.
A Life in the City
Larry Kelly grew up in Sayville, New York, on Long Island, the second of six children in a close Irish Italian family, member of the Class of ’73 at Sayville High, game for any sport, outstanding as a wrestler. He wanted to be an actor and had won a scholarship to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts on East 30th Street. Dawn Hewins, from Brookline, Massachusetts, was a student there too.
They went out for a while, broke up, got back together, got married at City Hall, had some successes in the New York theater world — Larry wrote a play, “Out!,” about the 1919 Black Sox scandal, that was produced off-Broadway in 1986 — started a family, decided they needed more reliable income, got education degrees and became teachers.
They moved into a modest brick co-op on West 92nd Street in 1997. I lived there too. Larry, an apologetic but helplessly addicted smoker, was often out in front of the building, always happy to chat. He was an ebullient presence, all 5-foot-6 of him, with a winning smile.
He taught English and drama at A. Philip Randolph, a high school on West 135th Street in Harlem where the students were mostly Black and Latino. He started boys and girls soccer teams and a drama club. He advised the debate team. He persuaded the English department to add the plays of August Wilson to the curriculum. His point: “These kids don’t want to read ‘The Canterbury Tales!’” He started his semesters with “Fences.” From there, he could take them to Shakespeare.
He was the teachers union representative, and then, encouraged by his principal, earned another master’s degree and returned to Randolph as an assistant principal.
Two years later he was asked to start a program for students who had been suspended from their schools. He and five teachers would work with them for the duration of their suspensions: 60 days, 90 days. The program, begun in the basement of Martin Luther King Jr. High School, became the Manhattan Alternate Learning Center for at-risk students. Larry won a battle to get the students credits toward graduation for their schoolwork. He retired in 2017.
Since then, Larry had been enjoying himself. He’d finally quit smoking. He played poker on Friday nights, and he and Dawn went to baseball games and out to hear music. They delighted in their granddaughters whenever they could see them; their older daughter, Jessica Christopher, 33, had moved with her husband to Maryland. They visited Larry’s brother Michael in Florida.
He’d been doing some dinner theater — “You Can’t Take It With You,” in South Orange, New Jersey — and had just opened in Fair Lawn in the Radburn Players’ production of “The Underpants,” Steve Martin’s adaptation of a German door-slamming sex farce. “I’m big in Jersey,” Larry would brag.
The whole cast of “The Underpants” got sick. Larry was the oldest, and the sickest.
Saying Their Goodbyes
In the days after Larry was admitted to the hospital, the crisis hit the city. The ICU in mid-March was swamped. “We got the sickest of the sick,” Larry’s nurse, Jessica Montanaro, said. “You know what you sign up for in a trauma hospital; your nurse brain doesn’t change, you know what you have to do. But it was shocking.”
When she went home to Westchester after a shift, she’d sit in the car, sometimes for half an hour, pulling herself together before she could go in the house to her husband and 10-year-old daughter. “Even when I wasn’t at the hospital there was never really an on-and-off button.” Because there was no school, her daughter spent days with her father at the pizzeria he ran in the Bronx.
She found herself particularly disturbed about Larry. “I liked him,” she said. “I was shocked at how fast he deteriorated. He looked so healthy, and fit, other than not being able to breathe.” Once, while flipping him onto his stomach to ease his breathing, she noticed the tattoo on his back: the king of hearts and the queen of diamonds playing poker, wearing Comedy and Tragedy masks.
“The saddest thing to me is that these patients have to die alone,” she said. “I talk to patients all the time, even if they’re in a coma. I just sit with them and tell them they’re not alone.”
Before the pandemic, a ventilator was intended primarily for short-term use. Total sedation is necessary; the patient’s reflex is to fight the intruding tube. People usually come off ventilators quickly, one way or another: able to breathe again for themselves, or gone. Larry was on a ventilator for 51 days.
Larry had seizures. Infections. Fevers. Pneumonia. Cerebral hemorrhages. Doctors struggled to take Larry off sedatives long enough to assess his brain activity. Their somber conclusion by the end of March: “No mentation.”
Dawn, Jackie and Danny were allowed to visit March 28, one by one, to see Larry, through a glass wall, and say their goodbyes.
But Larry held on.
Danny relayed updates to friends and family. The notes from the last days of March through the first weeks of April were grave.
“The status of Larry’s brain is the complete focus,” he wrote on March 31. “He is still having intermittent seizures, and the doctors have told us that traditionally patients who have had this trauma to their brain for this period of time are in danger of irreversible damage.”
He concluded that note with what became a hopeful mantra: “Miracle Larry.”
Jackie and Dawn kept to themselves in the apartment, afraid to go out. The city had closed down. Sirens blared without respite. Jackie, who works in marketing for Estée Lauder, had recovered from the virus pretty quickly, but she and Dawn were both struggling with their jobs. Jackie was on all the phone calls, when they came, with her mother and the hospital, recording what the doctors — rarely the same one — reported. “There was lots of crying ourselves to sleep,” Jackie said.
‘Let’s Go Miracle Larry!’
The death count in the city reached its peak April 7: 598, in an 11-day stretch when more than 500 people were dying every day. On Easter Sunday, April 12, 573 people in New York City died of the coronavirus.
That day, Larry Kelly opened his eyes.
He had what the doctors call a “purposeful response.” He turned in the direction of a doctor who was calling his name. Over the next few days he could squeeze a hand. He could follow a pencil with his eyes. He knew who he was. He knew he had a wife and two daughters.
The family clung to that tiny sliver of good news, aware of how tenuous it was. “All we really knew was that he wasn’t a vegetable,” Danny said.
At Dive Bar on West 96th Street, the Kellys’ favorite local joint, a big hand-colored sign was taped to the window: “Let’s Go Miracle Larry!” The owner told Dawn it wouldn’t come down until Larry came home.
Plans started to be made for a tracheotomy, an incision in Larry’s neck, so that the tube down his throat could be removed and the ventilator, which he still needed, could be hooked up through a trach tube, but there were obstacles before the operation could be performed. Larry had been given the powerful opioid fentanyl for weeks. As the doctors reduced his dosage, he went into withdrawal. They had to wean him with methadone.
At the end of April, Dawn learned that Larry had been moved in the middle of the night to Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital on First Avenue and 16th Street, to a unit set up specifically to get patients off ventilators. Although she was startled and angry that he’d been moved without her knowledge, she was also encouraged.
Larry was the new unit’s first patient; he’d been chosen because he had a chance of surviving. Erica Crouse, a physician assistant in North Carolina who had volunteered at the beginning of the pandemic to help out in New York, was the first person to take care of him there. “The question was his mental status,” she remembered. At this point, with COVID-19, it was a rare occurrence that a person was on a ventilator for so long. “We didn’t know how anyone was going to respond.”
On May 1, Erica set up a Zoom call for Larry and his family. It was the first time Larry had seen them since he was wheeled to the ambulance in March. “Hey, Dad,” said Jackie, softly.
They started Zooming every day, and Dawn could witness Larry’s halting improvement. He still couldn’t talk, and sometimes he fell asleep, but soon he was forming words; he couldn’t yet use his voice, but they did their best to read his lips.
On May 5, Danny knew Larry was back: He saw his big brother smile at a nurse and blow kisses in her direction. And when the family was trying to discern what Larry was saying and got it wrong, Larry would roll his eyes.
The month inched by. Slowly, Larry’s lungs began to work again, and by May 8, the ventilator was all but sidelined. By May 15 he was breathing almost exclusively on his own.
A feeding tube had sustained him for more than two months, and Larry, who loves to eat, had lost 30 pounds. He had started eating puréed meals: puréed chicken, puréed applesauce, puréed mashed potatoes.
“Aren’t mashed potatoes already puréed?” he would grumble. “I don’t know why they can’t purée up some ravioli and tomato sauce.” He craved McDonald’s. He was thrilled when an aide brought him an Italian ice.
By Memorial Day some measure of relief had spread through the city. Daily deaths had come down to double digits; 49 people died that day, with 466 new cases and 140 hospitalizations. Cuomo said people could gather in groups of up to 10, provided they practice social distancing and wear masks.
‘I’m Not Dead!’
As hospitalized coronavirus patients go, Larry Kelly was one of the lucky ones. He had no underlying conditions. He was cared for in a private hospital. Jack Cush, a lifelong friend from Sayville, now a rheumatologist in Dallas, often checked in with the hospital and helped the family decipher what they learned. Larry’s daughter Jessica is a physical therapist; her training helped her know what questions to ask the doctors as Larry’s case worsened and then seemed to improve. He has good health insurance. Tens of thousands in the city, particularly in poorer areas, do not have those advantages.
At the end of May, Larry was moved again, this time to the New Jewish Home on West 106th Street, to begin the long process of reclaiming his virus-ravaged body.
When I first spoke with him in mid-June, three therapists — speech, physical and occupational — were working with him six days a week. With the speech therapist he was practicing his swallow, an instinct he had to relearn after having a tube in his throat for so long. Larry is right-handed; his right side, which wasn’t working yet — possibly a result of brain trauma, possibly severe atrophy — was worrisome to him. And the physical therapist was helping him begin to walk again, little by little. He was still hooked up to a feeding tube.
Talking is how he passes the hours. Also, with no baseball on TV yet, he’s gotten into watching golf. He doesn’t have his phone (to his dismay, his phone, his watch and his clothes were all lost when he was put into a coma), but his hands don’t work well enough to use one anyway. He video chats with his family and friends via Alexa, which he can control with his voice.
I had been following Larry’s progress on his family’s Facebook posts. The week of our first conversation he’d had a major triumph. “I took seven steps,” he said. “I’m allowed to sit up on the side of the bed.”
The last thing he remembered before being put under sedation was sending Dawn that text as he was gasping for breath. The next thing he remembers, he said, was weeks later: someone asking him to follow a pencil with his eyes.
Like a number of gravely ill COVID-19 patients, he also has memories of extreme terror from the time he was in the coma. “I kept having a sense that someone was trying to kill me,” he said. “I was in a very dark place. I kept trying to yell, ‘I’m not dead!’”
He was dumbfounded when his family told him about the terror he had missed, in the city and the world. “It’s like something out of George Orwell,” he had said. “I woke up in a dystopia.”
Dawn was at home; schools were closed. Everyone was wearing masks.
Danny lost his job as director of human resources at Yankee Stadium, along with 1,800 seasonal workers he supervised. One in 5 New Yorkers were unemployed.
“I was astonished that I’d lost two months of my life,” he told me. “In a flip of a dime everyone’s life changed.”
From his hospital bed Larry witnessed the news of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of police, angered and saddened by its horror. He was encouraged, at least, by the young people protesting. “We’re living in a nightmare,” he said, shaking his head.
‘Like Jackie Robinson’
On Day 98, June 22, Larry had an egg-salad sandwich. He was sitting in a wheelchair for our video chat, looking and sounding markedly stronger, and he’d had a haircut and a shave. When he had awoken, his daughters said, he had a full beard, and his face was puffy from the sedatives. The grooming had cheered him, but he was a little down.
“I get blue,” he said. “I’m here with my thoughts. It’s easy to be here all day and get despondent.” He hasn’t had any psychological counseling, which surprises him.
His family had received a bill from Mount Sinai Morningside for $1.3 million. “They bring you back to life and then kill you with the bill!” he said. His insurance covered nearly all of it.
Danny reads Larry notes and posts on Facebook from his many well-wishers. “I always wondered what people would say about me when I died,” Larry said. “Now I know.”
June 29 was Dawn and Larry’s 42nd anniversary. Dawn walked the few blocks uptown to drop off a card for him. Because nursing homes, which are linked to more than 40% of coronavirus deaths, have prohibited visitors, she still has not been able to see Larry since March 17. He waited until she got home and called her via Alexa so she could watch his aide help him open the card. “42, ” he said. “Like Jackie Robinson.”
By July 9, the coronavirus-related death count in New York City was in single digits for the first time in four months. That hard-won moment, though, was all but eclipsed by the news from elsewhere in the country. Last Monday alone, Florida, Texas and California, all of which reopened early, reported 30,000 new cases, 18% of the world’s daily total. Despite quarantine requirements for anyone arriving in New York from the many states with high infection rates, officials expect the virus to seep back to the city.
Larry received some news of his own last week. He will be coming home Wednesday, 128 days after his ordeal began.
“I wouldn’t wish this sickness on anyone,” he said.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
ATLANTA — By the time the Rev. James Woodall came to know John Lewis, Lewis was already a longtime congressman and a towering figure in the civil rights movement, one whose legacy loomed large over Atlanta.
At 26, Woodall is one of the youngest leaders in the NAACP, serving as the president for the organization in Georgia. Despite the more than half a century that separated them, Woodall said he identified with Lewis as an inspirational leader who at a very young age worked to change the world.
The fight that Lewis led, Woodall said, was now his.
“I have been a student of his work from the seventh grade,” said Woodall, who grew up just outside of Atlanta. “He really was not OK with waiting for justice, he was not OK with incremental changes to a system that, in many regards, wanted him dead.”
Lewis, who died Friday at the age of 80, had long served as a kind of connective tissue, linking the lions of the civil rights movement to the new generation of activists in the city who stood on their shoulders. He was one of the few remaining leaders from that era, and his death has left many in Atlanta wrestling with what feels like a gaping void even as they try and push forward his ideals.
“The most humble of heroes, the most brave of giants,” Keisha Lance Bottoms, Atlanta’s mayor, said in a remembrance she posted on Twitter, adding, “He was my Congressman and my best example of true servant leadership.”
Lewis’ death has also added a layer of anguish to the turmoil that has rankled Atlanta for months. Protests broke out in the city, as in the rest of the country, after George Floyd died in the custody of the Minneapolis police in May, and the unrest intensified after Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, was fatally shot by the Atlanta police in June.
During these protests, a contingent of younger activists has emerged that is generations removed from the efforts of the past but still contending with the same struggles that their parents and grandparents faced.
In Lewis, they saw a kindred spirit. He had been the youngest of the major figures in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He was just 23 when he gave one of the most fiery speeches at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. (Others in his cohort pleaded with him to soften some of the most heated language in his speech.)
He moved to Atlanta in 1963 to become chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and made the city his home.
“He was never condescending or shaming toward younger people and their choice of actions, the way they decided to protest, what they were protesting,” said Jasmine Amussen, an editor of Burnaway, a magazine focused on arts and activism in the South.
“It was very reassuring and loving,” she added. “It almost feels like, I don’t know.” She paused as her voice broke. “This is a really tough time for this city.”
In Atlanta, Lewis has been given the kind of tributes reserved for the most prominent people in the city’s history: His face fills a 65-foot mural on the side of a downtown building declaring him a hero, and across the interstate, a busy thoroughfare was named the John Lewis Freedom Parkway in 2018. An exhibit showcasing his life and work greets visitors at Atlanta’s international airport.
Yet many in Atlanta became accustomed to seeing him in the flesh — shopping for produce and shaking hands at the Publix supermarket on Cascade Road and stopping in at Mary Mac’s Tea Room. (When Jo Carter, its longtime server and an Atlanta institution in her own right, retired in 2017, he was at the party.) Clerks at department stores would tip him off when suits were going on sale; he had a limited budget as a public servant, aides said, but he was also thrilled by a bargain.
Andrew Aydin, who worked as a policy adviser and digital director for Lewis, remembered him trying to place an order in a Burger King drive-thru. “The lady, through the speaker, said, “‘Is that you, John Lewis?’” Aydin recalled.
“I think that’s what people misunderstand,” he added. “They see the icon, but they didn’t just love him. They knew him. This wasn’t a guy hanging out at the Commerce Club. He was out in the streets. He was eating in the same place as everyone else.”
Atlanta had a preview of its pain now a week ago, when false reports circulated that he had died, spurring mournful social media posts and tributes before his office clarified that he was still alive.
When his death was announced late Friday, it came as many in the city were grieving the Rev. C.T. Vivian, another pioneering figure and associate of Martin Luther King Jr., who also died in Atlanta.
The Rev. Bernice King, the youngest daughter of King, posted photographs of both men on Twitter, saying: “Elders, now ancestors. Hallelujah.”
They were part of a generation that molded Atlanta as it grew into what has come to be regarded as a “Black mecca,” a capital for culture and commerce, home to some of the most prestigious Black colleges and universities. African Americans gravitated to the city from across the South, drawn by a chance for upward mobility and a sense that the racial hostility that was onerous in so much of the region was less prevalent.
“That gave the Atlanta movement a very special kind of flavor and power, and a capacity to try and produce social change,” said Barry Lee, a longtime history professor at Morehouse College.
Yet the recent turbulence has illuminated the disparities that exist in the city, invigorating activists over months of protests. The death of Brooks in June prompted the resignation of the city’s police chief, Erika Shields, and for Bottoms to push for changes in use-of-force procedures. The outbreak of the coronavirus has also drawn attention to glaring gaps in health care, as African Americans have been among the hardest hit in Georgia.
Lewis’ sense of defiance — against the police officers who beat him or, more recently, against cancer — has served as a lesson for the younger leaders who are coming up behind him, they said.
“He was unbelievably brave and he was willing to keep working on things even if it didn’t seem possible to win,” Amussen said. “Whereas now, people only want to get involved in things they can win. But he was willing to do the day in, day out, grinding it out work that has to be done.”
Aydin’s first job working in Lewis’ office entailed sifting through the onslaught of mail that arrived: complaints, pleas to vote one way or another, requests for help from constituents.
“It was almost as low as you could go,” he said. “But for John Lewis, the mail was something sacred.”
Lewis told Aydin that he connected with King after a mentor encouraged him to write to him. King responded and sent a bus ticket.
Aydin grew close with Lewis in working for him about 13 years and even worked with him on a series of graphic novels about the congressman’s life.
“His way of mentoring was to do something with you,” Aydin said. “And you tried to hang on and pick up as much as you could, and if you were lucky, you kind of got up to speed with him.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. — Rep. Rashida Tlaib, one of Congress’ most famous members, is perhaps best known for her membership in the progressive group known as “the squad” and her strident attacks on President Donald Trump.
But on a recent Saturday, she stood in a former manufacturing plant in one of America’s poorest districts, talking about power outages as she worked to beat back a stiff primary challenge that is threatening her political future.
“Where were the outages? Look at the map,” Tlaib told members of the Detroit chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, the influential Black sorority, as she railed against DTE Energy, the local power company. “Black and brown communities overwhelmingly have outages because they don’t fix the infrastructure in our neighborhoods. DTE, I don’t need you to issue a statement that says ‘Black Lives Matter.’ I need you to show me Black lives matter.”
The message drew raucous applause in Highland Park, a city surrounded by Detroit where Black residents make up roughly 90% of the population, and where voters are less concerned with the latest Washington controversy than they are about coronavirus testing, neighborhood blight and losing power whenever thunderstorms strike.
Despite — or perhaps because of — millions of dollars in her campaign account and a national profile, Tlaib, 43, is likely the most endangered member of the squad, the diverse group of progressive Democratic women who were elected to the House in 2018 and have come to embody the vanguard of the party’s majority.
Catapulted to national prominence by a profane call to impeach the president uttered on the day she was sworn in, and insulted with racist tropes by Trump, Tlaib has drawn plenty of headlines during her first term. Now her primary contest — a bitter rematch against a prominent Black leader — is testing Tlaib’s ability to ensure that her work outshines her celebrity.
It has also pitted two overlapping and often allied Democratic constituencies — Black Americans and the progressive left — against each other, making Tlaib, a symbol of the party’s growing diversity, into a target.
For more than a half century, Tlaib’s district was represented by John Conyers Jr., a co-founder of the Congressional Black Caucus who died last year. Brenda Jones, the Black president of the Detroit City Council who is challenging her, has positioned herself as a more fitting successor.
Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, made history in 2018 as one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress.
Jones and her supporters argue that Tlaib has become too preoccupied with national issues to tend to her district, which snakes through portions of Detroit and a mishmash of suburbs in Wayne County. They say her outspokenness against Trump and centrist Democrats like Hillary Clinton, who Tlaib booed at a rally in Iowa last year, has hampered her work in Congress.
“You can be vocal, but the things that were being done — like calling the president a ‘MF’ or booing Hillary — every time something like that happened, I was getting calls from people saying ‘You’re more professional than this,’” Jones said. “I’m not interested in being a rock star. I’m just interested in bringing home the money, working for the people of the 13th district and uniting the community.”
Two years ago, Jones eked out a 2-point victory over Tlaib in a special primary election to serve out the remainder of Conyers’ term after his abrupt resignation. But in a six-way primary held the same day, Tlaib defeated Jones to win the nomination for the race to succeed him, effectively ensuring she would win the election for the next full term in the solidly Democratic district.
The outcome left bad blood on both sides. Now, Jones has regrouped to challenge Tlaib in the Aug. 4 Democratic primary, drawing the support of all four of their former rivals, including former state Sen. Ian Conyers, the great-nephew of the late congressman, as well as a large contingent of influential Detroit ministers and Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP.
“I’m always for African American leadership,” said Coleman Young II, a former state senator and one of the 2018 primary contenders who has endorsed Jones this time. “You don’t have to be Black to represent Black people, but you do have to be informed and it has to be a priority. And I just don’t see it being a priority for constituents of the 13th district right now.”
Tlaib and her supporters argue that her opponents are trying to caricature her, highlighting a few moments of less-than-polite behavior and overlooking her legislative accomplishments and personal connection to her constituents.
They note that a wide range of unions have endorsed Tlaib, who has opened four community offices, held more town hall-style events than most in Congress and ensured funding for her district in coronavirus relief legislation. She also successfully amended an infrastructure plan Democrats pushed through the House this month to add $22.5 billion to replace lead pipes that contribute to the poisoning of children.
In Highland Park last weekend, Tlaib, dressed in Zeta blue and a worn-down pair of gray sneakers for a day of knocking on doors, worked the muggy room, hustling to pass out flyers to a crowd of mask-wearing voters, the sweat beading on their foreheads.
“I’m just Rashida here! At home, I’m just Rashida,” Tlaib said in an interview. “I was born and raised in Detroit. People try to take that away from me.”
She said she understands the desire for Black leadership, and has worked to elevate the voices of her Black neighbors and advisers.
“I surround myself with people that have the incredibly important lens of being Black in America,” Tlaib said. “If they’re not at the table guiding and leading, I’m not doing my job.”
The contest is not playing out neatly along racial lines. Tasha Green, the first Black woman ever elected to the Westland City Council, has endorsed Tlaib, who she said had been responsive to her pleas for help getting personal protective equipment like masks and gloves to seniors in her district to protect them from the pandemic.
“Rashida gave me an address and told me to go over there and get the PPE I needed for my residents,” Green recalled. “If people would just set aside the racial component for five minutes and think about who is serving our community, it’s Rashida.”
Tlaib also says she can work with Republicans, pointing to her six years in the Michigan Legislature, bipartisan support for her anti-lead amendment, and Trump’s signature on a bill she wrote to protect federal retirees from fraud.
“The president that I ran on impeaching signed a bill into law that I was the lead sponsor on,” Tlaib said.
A progressive in the mold of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Tlaib burst onto the national scene after her win in 2018 when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York posted a photo of the two of them along with Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — all representatives-elect at the time — with the caption “Squad.”
While Tlaib says she was at first reluctant about the name, which some see as exclusionary, she has since embraced it.
“We own it now, but we also make sure it’s an extension of other people,” she said. “We love that little girls come up to us and say, ‘Can we be part of the squad?’”
Trump has seized on the grouping as well, assailing Tlaib and the other lawmakers as unpatriotic and at one point telling them to “go back” to their countries of origin, although all but Omar are American-born. At Trump’s urging, Israel blocked Tlaib from entering the country last summer to visit her grandmother, before relenting.
Her three fellow freshmen have rallied to Tlaib’s side in the race, forming the “Squad Victory Fund” to pool their campaign financial resources. That could add to Tlaib’s eye-popping fundraising advantage, having raised more than $2.8 million, compared with Jones’ $135,000.
A super PAC called “Concerned Citizens of Michigan” has formed to support Jones. It has raised $71,500, $50,000 of which has come from a dark-money group calling itself the Community Education Committee.
Had the 2018 primary been a head-to-head race, many believe Jones would have prevailed. But today, Tlaib is politically stronger, and the pandemic has severely hampered Jones’ campaign.
While Tlaib has been knocking on doors and attending events, Jones, who announced in early April that she had contracted the virus, is mostly ensconced in her Detroit home, participating in campaign and fundraising calls via Zoom and remote council meetings.
“People don’t want people knocking on their doors. They’re not ready for that face-to-face interaction. People know me from the work that I’ve done,” she said. “Word-of-mouth works.”
Not all of it has been positive.
During recent council meetings, activists against police violence have called on her to support a resolution to drop all charges against arrested protesters, defund police and end the use of facial recognition software by city law enforcement. Jones has said she will not interfere with the legal system.
Tlaib has criticized Jones’ leadership, noting that Detroit has faced legal challenges over water shut-off policies, the use of facial recognition software and allegations of overtaxing residents by $600 million during her tenure.
Jones is hoping a surge in voting from Detroit, her political stronghold, will work in her favor. So far, more than 104,000 Detroiters have requested absentee ballots, far exceeding the 52,885 who voted both by absentee and in person in the 2018 primary.
She said she would take a different approach than Tlaib’s to representing the district in Washington.
“I’ll be forming a squad as well,” Jones said. “But my squad will be working with the poorest districts to ensure resources are sent to those districts so they will no longer be the poorest districts. I’ll be a part of that squad.”

Fary Isn’t Joking About Race in France Right Now [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
PARIS — As news of George Floyd’s killing by police ricocheted around the world last month, French stand-up comedian Fary Lopes, known as Fary, wasn’t telling jokes.
On national radio, he described the country as “fundamentally not anti-racist.” In a video for Colors, a Berlin-based music platform, he challenged viewers: “Tell the truth. I was born here, but you’re still terrified.” The clip has been viewed more than 750,000 times.
Even without punchlines, the declarations were in keeping with the comedy acts that have made Fary a household name in France. His two Netflix specials, “Fary Is the New Black,” from 2018, and the two-part “Hexagone,” this year, delve with bracing directness into his experiences as a Frenchman of African heritage. In 2019, he caused a stir when he greeted the audience at the Molière Awards — the French version of the Tonys — by saying “Hello, white people!”
In France, outrage over Floyd’s death has fed into existing frustrations with the country’s relationship with race. Last month, large Black Lives Matter demonstrations took place in Paris, protesting local police brutality and the French state’s refusal to officially recognize racial or ethnic difference, in the name of a “colorblind” vision of equality.
Fary remains conflicted about overt activism. “Originally, I really didn’t want to talk about it,” he said of the recent protests, in an interview at the comedy club he co-owns in Paris, Madame Sarfati. “I didn’t want to be seen as the spokesperson of a movement, because it’s the best way to ensure that what I do no longer belongs to me.”
Fary, 29, has been single-minded about forging his own path and breaking down barriers as he goes. “Fary Is the New Black” was the first stand-up special that Netflix had filmed in France, after the comedian and his team approached the streaming service. He has challenged stand-up’s reputation in France as lowbrow entertainment, working with artist JR, who designed the performance space at Madame Sarfati, and film director Ladj Ly, who was nominated at the Oscars last year for “Les Misérables.” He’s also taken his stand-up to unusually prestigious venues: “Hexagone” was recorded at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, home of theater director Peter Brook.
While sketch comedy has a long history here, American-style stand-up only gained mainstream recognition in the 2000s. Comic Jamel Debbouze first opened doors for stand-up hopefuls in 2006 when he founded the Jamel Comedy Club, a venue in Paris in which a namesake TV show was filmed and where many of French stand-up’s biggest names — including Blanche Gardin, Shirley Souagnon and Fary — cut their teeth.
Fary’s first performances, he said, were at age 11, imitating Debbouze’s sets with his cousin. His uncle would hold charity events to raise money for children in Cape Verde, where Fary’s parents were born, and the duo was enlisted to entertain guests. “The first time, we did a Jamel set, and the next time, to give them something new, we wrote our own jokes,” he remembered.
When he was in high school in St.-Maur des Fossés, a suburb to the east of Paris, his history teacher, Jessie Troja, spotted his gift for sarcastic one-liners and offered to help him craft a one-man show. “She was like a stepmom to me. She would take me to Paris for open mics,” Fary said. “She instilled in me the belief that I was going to do this with my life and nothing else, that I had something.”
Fary worked to set himself apart. In a genre not known for being fashion-forward, his style — harem pants, oversize jackets, bleached dreadlocks — stood out. Alongside his standup sets, he also spent eight months at the Cours Florent, a prestigious drama school.
Jason Brokerss, a comic who co-writes Fary’s sets, describes Fary as a comedy nerd. “He will message me at 5 a.m. and tell me to watch not even a set, but one joke, at this exact time stamp,” he said in an interview.
Fary, whose long list of favorite comedians includes Chris Rock and Eddie Murphy, described his passion for the craft as “painful at times.” “There are jokes that make my head spin because I wonder how you even get to that level of precision. It’s the same thing as writing an alexandrine,” he said, referring to the classical French poetic meter. “There are so many constraints.”
His comedy club, Madame Sarfati, is named after one of the most famous characters in French comedy: the parody of a Jewish mother played by Élie Kakou, who died in 1999. Modeled after North American clubs, it is one of only a few venues in Paris that offers near-daily performance opportunities for French comedians. It took the investors, who include theater mogul Jean-Marc Dumontet, two years to find and renovate the venue, a former restaurant chosen partly for its location near the Châtelet station, a transit hub easily accessible for suburban visitors.
Before Madame Sarfati opened in November, Fary and Dumontet imagined a number of “catastrophic scenarios.” Fary admitted wryly that they didn’t include a pandemic; the club was closed for nearly four months as France went into lockdown, at an estimated cost of around $110,000, according to its manager, Jennifer Soussan.
Madame Sarfati reopened to the public last week, and while social distancing rules meant an audience of 75 people instead of the usual 100, the all-male group of comics that took to the stage for the reopening night were visibly hungry to try out new material. Jokes about lockdown, racism and police violence came thick and fast. Madame Sarfati keeps its programming a mystery, which means there is no telling whether you’ll see Fary, Brokerss or newcomers strut onto the stage designed by JR. “I want people to come for stand-up, not for me,” Fary said.
He is arguably only now approaching maturity in his own career. The evolution between “Fary Is the New Black” and “Hexagone” is palpable, with the latter leaning more into social commentary and personal material about his family. “It’s like a date. At the beginning you show a version of yourself that you imagine to be more seductive, a little haughty,” he said. “Then you reveal more. I’m becoming myself.”
Jokes about race may be coming to him less easily at the moment, but he has just starred in a new comedy feature, “Tout Simplement Noir” (“Simply Black”), directed by Jean-Pascal Zadi. In the mockumentary, which resonates presciently with current events, Fary plays an opportunist version of himself who latches onto the main character’s plan to organize a protest for only Black people.
Despite the success of the recent real-life demonstrations in Paris, Fary isn’t convinced that meaningful change is on the horizon. “France is a country that sees its culture as fixed, not as something that evolves and adapts,” he said.
Still, the lineup at Madame Sarfati last week offered the kind of racial diversity you rarely see in French culture. Fary suggested that this might actually hamper stand-up’s efforts to be taken seriously, before deadpanning, “Maybe it needs more white people, actually.”

Jamaal Bowman, a progressive insurgent, has scored a stunning victory over Rep. Eliot Engel of New York in a Democratic primary, beating back the efforts of the Democratic establishment to protect a 16-term incumbent.
Bowman, a middle school principal from Yonkers, was declared the winner Friday, after a count of absentee ballots verified what seemed clear on primary night, when he emerged with a commanding lead over Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
The victory came with the help of an array of stars from the Democratic Party’s left wing, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
As a first-time candidate with a fiery anti-establishment message, Bowman’s victory has echoes of Ocasio-Cortez’s own stunning win in 2018 over another entrenched incumbent in New York, Rep. Joseph Crowley, then the No. 4 Democrat in the House.
In the closing weeks of the campaign, as Bowman gained momentum and prominent backers, members of the Democratic old guard tried to salvage Engel’s flagging campaign. Hillary Clinton endorsed the congressman a week before the primary, followed in short order by Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, a third-term Democrat, who said that Engel deserved a vote because “seniority matters.”
Those pleas followed endorsements from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California; Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip; and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic Caucus chairman.
All was for naught, as Bowman bested Engel and two other Democratic challengers, embracing progressive plans like the Green New Deal and “Medicare for All,” while also preaching the need for broader social changes like criminal justice reform and addressing income inequality.
Such issues were given fresh emphasis and added urgency as the nation reeled in the wake of the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May. The subsequent demonstrations were broadly incorporated into, and invigorated, the Black Lives Matter movement, and gave a powerful talking point for Bowman, who is African American and said he had been physically attacked by police as a child.
In a statement released shortly after The Associated Press called the race Friday morning, Bowman referenced both his compelling biography and the continuing reckoning on race and policing in America.
“I’m a Black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing project. That story doesn’t usually end in Congress,” he said. “But today, that 11-year old boy who was beaten by police is about to be your next representative.”
The Black Lives Matter movement also served as backdrop for a cringe-inducing moment for Engel. At a news conference in New York City in early June, the congressman was caught on microphone suggesting that he was only there because of his contested race.
“If I didn’t have a primary,” he said, “I wouldn’t care.”
Engel, 73, was first elected in 1988 and had practiced a form of old-school politics: He slowly rose in party ranks, glad-handed a series of passing presidents and boasted of perks he brought home to the 16th Congressional District, which includes the northern Bronx and portions of southern Westchester County.
Engel becomes the fifth House incumbent and second Democrat to fall in this year’s primaries; Daniel Lipinski of Illinois was the other. The three Republicans who lost were Steve King of Iowa, Denver Riggleman of Virginia and Scott Tipton of Colorado.
Bowman received ample financial help from liberal groups like the Working Families Party and political action committees like the Justice Democrats, which jointly spent more than $1 million to oust Engel.
The coronavirus outbreak, which killed more than 4,500 people in the Bronx and Westchester, also profoundly changed the primary campaign, limiting in-person campaigning and forcing debates to be conducted via Zoom.
Bowman, who claimed 1 million calls to voters, also hammered Engel’s lack of presence in the district during the crisis, suggesting that the incumbent spent much of his time at a home he owns in suburban Maryland. Engel pushed back on this assertion, saying he was a steady presence in the district, including Riverdale, where he lives.
Like other closely watched races, the final result in the 16th District had been delayed for weeks, as election officials in Westchester County and the Bronx — the two counties which make up parts of the district — struggled to count tens of thousands of absentee ballots.
After the machine count of ballots, Bowman led Engel, 30,740-18,020. Absentee ballots in Westchester County had narrowed the margin slightly but not enough to surmount Bowman’s big lead in the Bronx, where he had nearly doubled Engel’s total.
Bowman, 44, is the prohibitive favorite to win in November in the 16th District, where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 4-to-1. There is no Republican candidate, and only one other challenger, Patrick McManus, of the Conservative Party.

Francia, donde la raza es un tema tabú, abre los ojos frente al racismo [With graphic(s)]

Con la vista puesta en Estados Unidos, los hijos de inmigrantes de África y el Caribe introducen el tema racial en el discurso público, en un evidente desafío al universalismo francés.
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times.
PARÍS — Durante su infancia en Francia, Maboula Soumahoro nunca se consideró negra.
En casa, sus padres inmigrantes destacaban la cultura de los diulas, un grupo étnico musulmán de Costa de Marfil, en África occidental. En su vecindario, se identificaba como marfileña frente a otros hijos de inmigrantes africanos.
Apenas de adolescente —años después de que el descubrimiento de Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, El Show de Bill Cosby y el hiphop la hicieran “soñar con estar en onda como los afroestadounidenses”— comenzó a sentir una afinidad racial con sus amigos, relató.
“Todos éramos hijos de inmigrantes de Guadalupe, Martinica, África, y todos éramos un poco distintos a nuestros padres”, recordó Soumahoro, de 44 años y experta en temas raciales que vivió una década en Estados Unidos. “Éramos franceses a nuestra nueva manera y no éramos franceses blancos. En nuestras casas era diferente, pero a pesar de todo nos encontramos los unos a los otros, y en ese momento te conviertes en negro”.
Además de estimular acalorados debates sobre el racismo, el asesinato de George Floyd a manos de la policía de Mineápolis ha enfatizado la urgencia de encontrar una nueva forma de pensar sobre la raza en el discurso público de Francia, una nación donde tradicionalmente se han silenciado los temas raciales y la religión para elevar un ideal sin prejuicios raciales en el que toda la gente comparte los mismos derechos universales.
Ese ideal a menudo se ha quedado corto en la realidad, en especial a medida que la sociedad francesa se ha vuelto más diversa y la discriminación sigue arraigada, lo cual genera dudas sobre el posible deterioro del modelo universalista.
En la actualidad, quienes tal vez lo cuestionan más son muchos de los franceses negros que en décadas recientes han abierto los ojos frente al racismo, con la ayuda de la cultura pop de Estados Unidos, sus pensadores e incluso sus diplomáticos radicados en París, quienes hace una década detectaron y alentaron a jóvenes líderes negros en Francia.
Para sus oponentes, negros y blancos, cuestionar la tradición universalista se percibe como parte de la más amplia “estadounización” de la sociedad francesa. Según esa visión, el riesgo de este cuestionamiento es la fragmentación de Francia, y representa una amenaza mucho más crucial para los principios fundacionales de la república moderna que las quejas familiares sobre la invasión de los McDonald’s o las películas taquilleras de Hollywood.
Incluso aquellos franceses negros que se han sentido inspirados por Estados Unidos también consideran que la sociedad estadounidense tiene fallas profundas y es violenta en términos racistas. En Francia, la gente de distinta ascendencia se mezcla con más libertad y, aunque las personas negras ocupan menos puestos de alto perfil que en Estados Unidos, disfrutan de acceso universal a la educación, la atención médica y otros servicios como todos los ciudadanos franceses.
“Cuando pienso en los dos países, no creo que uno sea mejor que el otro”, opinó Soumahoro, quien fue profesora de estudios afroestadounidenses en la Universidad de Columbia y ahora da clases en la Universidad de Tours. “Para mí, son dos sociedades racistas que manejan el racismo a su manera”.
En Francia, la mayoría de quienes están repensando la raza son los hijos de inmigrantes del otrora imperio colonial. Tras crecer en familias con un fuerte conocimiento de sus identidades étnicas independientes, con el tiempo comenzaron a desarrollar un sentimiento compartido de conciencia racial en sus vecindarios y escuelas.
Pap Ndiaye —un historiador que lideró los esfuerzos para introducir los estudios sobre la cultura negra como una disciplina académica en Francia con la publicación de su libro de 2008 La Condition Noire (La condición de ser negro)— dijo que se percató de su raza tan solo después de estudiar en Estados Unidos en la década de 1990.
“Es una experiencia que viven todos los franceses negros cuando van a Estados Unidos”, dijo Ndiaye, de 54 años, quien da clases en el Instituto de Estudios Políticos de París. “Es la experiencia de un país en la que se refleja el color de la piel y no se oculta detrás de un discurso sin prejuicios raciales”.
Ndiaye, de padre senegalés y madre francesa, es un métis en el contexto francés (una persona mestiza), aunque se identifica como negro.
Sus perspectivas del mundo y de sí mismo fueron un desafío radical para el Estado francés. Desde hace tiempo, el universalismo francés, con sus orígenes en la Ilustración y la Revolución Francesa, ha sostenido que todas las personas gozan de derechos fundamentales como la igualdad y la libertad. Como persiste la creencia de que ningún grupo debería tener preferencia sobre otro, sigue siendo ilegal recabar datos sobre la raza en los censos y casi para cualquier otro propósito oficial.
Sin embargo, el trato desigual hacia las mujeres en Francia y hacia la gente de tez distinta a la blanca en todas las colonias contradijo ese ideal universalista.
“La universalidad podría funcionar con bastante facilidad si no hubiera tantos inmigrantes o si fueran católicos blancos”, dijo Gérard Araud, exembajador de Francia en Estados Unidos. “Pero frente al islam por un lado y los africanos negros por el otro, es evidente que este modelo ha llegado a su límite. Así que, por un lado, el debate gira en torno a este universalismo, que es un hermoso ideal, pero por otro lado, también se trata de expresar que, en efecto, no está funcionando”.
Tania de Montaigne, una autora francesa que ha escrito sobre asuntos raciales, señaló que los franceses negros solo lograrán integrarse por completo a través del Estado de derecho y la ciudadanía. Según ella, enfatizar la identidad racial haría que los franceses negros fueran siempre marginados en una sociedad en la que la abrumadora mayoría aspira a un universalismo sin prejuicios raciales.
“Dicen, sin importar el lugar del mundo donde estés, la lengua que hables, tu historia, que hay algo en la naturaleza de la raza negra que perdura”, comentó De Montaigne, de 44 años, cuyos padres emigraron de Martinica y la República Democrática del Congo. “Pero esto es precisamente lo que imposibilita la obtención de la ciudadanía, porque siempre habrá algo en mí que nunca será incluido en la sociedad”.
En Estados Unidos, muchos inmigrantes de África, el Caribe o Asia desarrollan un sentido compartido de raza y se vuelven muy conscientes del papel de lo racial en Estados Unidos, un país donde esto forma parte de la conversación diaria.
Rokhaya Diallo, de 42 años, una periodista que también es una de las activistas antirracismo más prominentes de Francia, dijo que se dio cuenta del sentido compartido de raza solo al ser adulta y encontrarse a menudo a sí misma como la única persona negra en un entorno académico o profesional. Ella creció en La Courneuve, un suburbio de París conocido como banlieue , en un edificio con una mayoría de inmigrantes procedentes de las antiguas colonias de Francia en el sudeste asiático.
Nunca se habló de raza. Pero las imágenes fugaces de personas negras en la televisión francesa tocaron una fibra sensible en Diallo, cuyos padres vinieron de Senegal y Gambia. Al igual que muchas personas de su generación, amaba una serie de televisión para niños llamada Club Dorothée . Pero nunca podrá olvidar un episodio —un tropo colonial— en que la presentadora, una mujer blanca, era hervida viva en un caldero por tres hombres negros.
“Lo hablé con mi hermano”, dijo Diallo. “No pudimos ponerlo en palabras, pero recuerdo cómo nos molestó: caníbales, negros estúpidos, cosas así”.
Por el contrario, los programas estadounidenses que se transmitieron más tarde en Francia, como El príncipe de Bel-Air o el Show de Bill Cosby , mostraban a personas negras “cómodas en su piel”, dijo Diallo, y agregó: “Las únicas imágenes positivas de personas negras que vi vinieron de Estados Unidos”.
Gracias a un programa del gobierno estadounidense, Diallo, que en 2007 fundó una organización antirracismo llamada Les Indivisibles, visitó Estados Unidos en 2010 para aprender sobre “la gestión de la diversidad étnica en Estados Unidos”.
Diallo es una de varias personas de alto perfil que participaron en el programa de Estados Unidos, un hecho que ha contribuido al temor, especialmente entre los conservadores franceses, de una “americanización” de la sociedad francesa.
La Embajada de Estados Unidos en París comenzó a acercarse a las minorías étnicas y raciales en Francia después de los ataques del 11 de septiembre, como parte de un impulso global para “ganar corazones y mentes”.
La embajada organizó programas educativos sobre temas como la acción afirmativa, un concepto tabú en Francia, que atrajo al público francés no blanco por primera vez, dijo Randianina Peccoud, quien supervisó los programas de divulgación y se jubiló de la embajada el año pasado.
Peccoud, que es de Madagascar, una ex colonia francesa, también identificó a líderes de base como Diallo en los banlieues , lo que a menudo provocó reacciones enojadas de los funcionarios franceses y alimentó sospechas que persisten.
“Temían que las personas en los banlieues comenzaran a ser un poco conscientes de su propia situación en la sociedad francesa”, dijo Peccoud.
Las visitas a Estados Unidos, organizadas alrededor de temas como organización comunitaria en Chicago y diversidad, también dieron a los participantes una introducción a una visión alternativa de la sociedad.
Almamy Kanouté, actor, activista y líder de las protestas contra la violencia policial en Francia, visitó Estados Unidos en 2011 para aprender sobre políticas hacia los nuevos inmigrantes. En Mineápolis, conoció a un hombre francófono de Laos cuyas raíces fueron reconocidas a pesar de haberse convertido en ciudadano estadounidense, en contraste con las políticas asimilacionistas de Francia.
“Aquí quieren que nos fusionemos en un solo cuerpo y que dejemos de lado nuestra diversidad cultural”, dijo Kanouté, de 40 años, cuyos padres son de Mali y quien apareció en Les Misérables , la película nominada al Oscar. “Con nosotros, eso no es posible. Somos franceses, pero no olvidamos lo que nos completa”.
Para los jóvenes negros en Francia, la conciencia sobre la raza en parte surgió a partir del trabajo de la vieja generación. Binetou Sylla, de 31 años y coautora de Le Dérangeur , un libro sobre la raza en Francia, mencionó que recuerda con claridad cuando compró la primera edición de La Condition Noire de Ndiaye, una obra que sirvió para fundar los estudios sobre la cultura negra en Francia, y “lo devoré”.
Otra autora, Rhoda Tchokokam, de 29 años, creció en Camerún antes de migrar a Francia a la edad de 17 años. Aunque su conciencia racial surgió en Francia, evolucionó en Estados Unidos, donde estudió dos años, vio todas las películas de Spike Lee y descubrió las obras de Toni Morrison y las feministas negras como Angela Davis y Audre Lorde.
“Cuando comencé a conocer gente negra en Francia, empecé a ampliar un poco mi visión”, admitió Tchokokam. “Todavía no me consideraba negra porque es un proceso largo, gracias al cual ahora me defino como negra en términos políticos. En ese entonces, comencé a concientizarme y, cuando llegué a Estados Unidos, fue cuando pude expresarlo en palabras”.

In late May, shortly after the killing of George Floyd, mezzo-soprano J’Nai Bridges was invited by Los Angeles Opera to give a virtual recital.
“As much as I wanted to, I wasn’t in the right emotional space to present myself in that way,” she later recalled in an online discussion with tenor Lawrence Brownlee. So she made a counteroffer: What if she assembled a group of fellow Black singers for a panel on race and inequality in opera?
The company said yes, and as Black Lives Matter protests raged across the country, Bridges moderated a nearly 90-minute conversation of striking scope and candor — by turns a group-therapy session and an improvised manifesto for the future of an art form that historically has elevated select singers of color while remaining overwhelmingly white offstage, from the rehearsal room to the boardroom.
Airing as a Facebook Live video, the panel has since been seen by more than 60,000 people. It should be required viewing for all leaders of American opera companies, and sent to the members of every board. Because if there ever was a moment for sweeping change, it’s now.
The coronavirus pandemic has closed theaters nationwide, forcing companies, whose seasons are typically scheduled far in advance, to rethink the coming years with a level of flexibility and creativity that once seemed unimaginable. But with upheaval comes an opportunity, and the end of excuses, to truly reform opera’s culture — to place anti-racism front and center as the industry rebuilds itself.
Opera companies can start by simply paying attention to what Black artists are saying in discussions like the one organized by Bridges, or in online talk shows such as Brownlee’s “The Sitdown With LB” and soprano Karen Slack’s “Kiki Konversations.” While the problems that have come up in these conversations are nothing new, they have new urgency at a time of racial unrest that many say just feels different — a time at which, as Bridges put it, “people are listening.”
Brownlee and Slack were among the artists who took part in her panel, which also included soprano Julia Bullock, bass Morris Robinson and tenor Russell Thomas. The stories they shared would amount to a human resources crisis in any workplace: Christopher Koelsch, Los Angeles Opera’s president and chief executive, said in an interview that his initial reaction to the video was “horror and sorrow that the lived experience of those artists went unheard in that raw way.”
Reflecting on police brutality and the racist threats made against Christian Cooper while he was bird-watching in Central Park, Robinson said in the discussion that he has always known that something similar could happen to him.
“I walk around every opera rehearsal I’ve ever been to guarded,” he said, “cognizant of the fact that my interaction needs to be very public, in front of everyone, and very innocuous, such that all doubts, all potential images, are eradicated.”
He described casual indignities he has experienced throughout his career, such as the dissonance between the praise he receives onstage and the slights he encounters away from it: being told by an audience member that a light was out in the bathroom, or being asked by another where he parked the bus. He and Thomas, during a summer run of Verdi’s “Il Trovatore” in Cincinnati, attended a board leadership party where they felt forced to keep their cool in the face of brazen racism from a white donor.
“I still have to come and do my job because I still want to get that check,” Thomas said. “I have children to feed, a mortgage to pay.”
There was a collective sigh of exasperation at the mention of how Blackness in opera more or less ends on stage. “In 20 years, I’ve never been hired by a Black person; I’ve never been directed by a Black person; I’ve never had a Black CEO of a company; I’ve never had a Black president of the board; I’ve never had a Black conductor,” Robinson said. “I don’t even have Black stage managers. None, not ever, for 20 years.”
The Metropolitan Opera, the nation’s largest opera house — indeed, its largest performing arts organization — paints a telling picture. Its board of 45 has only three Black managing directors. Of the 10 people on its music staff, one is Black; of the 90-member orchestra, two. The Met has presented 306 operas in its 137-year history, none of them by a Black composer. (That will change when it stages Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” in a coming season.)
Last season opened with a production of “Porgy and Bess,” which despite having an almost exclusively Black cast — as required by the estate of its creators, the Gershwin brothers — was directed and conducted by white men (though choreographed by a Black woman, Camille A. Brown). At the bare minimum, Thomas said, that can’t happen anymore.
“Stop allowing white people to tell Black people about the Black experience,” he said. “That, to me, is outrageous. Don’t tell me about how I should feel to be Black and how I should move.”
Bullock, who early in the conversation said, “I’m getting so tired of trying to make peace within myself,” called for an anonymous survey to identify patterns of racial inequity in the field, including at conservatories. Bridges said in a later interview that, similar to sexual harassment workshops, companies should mandate racism and diversity training.
Slack’s demand, she said in the video, amounted to no more than “humanity”: “I’m not asking for your seat. I’m asking that you move over so I can sit in mine, and you be OK with that.”
There are signs that leaders in the opera world are listening, though that is only one step toward progress. “It’s very easy right now to be an ally,” Brownlee said in an interview. “But what I have charged people to do is be deliberate. I told my agent, I told general directors: Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is.”
Some Black musicians, like their counterparts in other fields, bristle at the idea of being a teacher to their white colleagues. It’s not their responsibility, but it is something that Bridges, an ambassador for the Coalition for African Americans in the Performing Arts, said she is passionate about, adding that during the past month she has been in conversation with numerous organizations that reached out to her.
For its part, Los Angeles Opera, Koelsch said, “will commit that on every level of the company’s operations, this work is central.” The Met — which didn’t ban the use of blackface in its productions until 2015 and whose reigning diva, Anna Netrebko, has demonstrated and defended the racist practice on social media — announced in June that it would hire its first chief diversity officer. Peter Gelb, the company’s general manager, said in an interview that the Met would also revamp its traditionally unpaid internship program, introducing payment and a campaign to actively recruit a diverse pool of applicants.
“It’s all going to be a long-term project, which is starting now,” Gelb said.
That is the hope of Black artists — and activists more broadly — who worry that the widespread support among white people this summer may only be temporary. “I don’t want this just to be a hashtag or a one-time thing,” Bridges said. “This needs to be an ongoing conversation, forever.”

The first word, Black, was designed by Tijay Mohammed, a Ghanaian-born artist, and used vibrant Kente fabric design and Adinkra symbols, which represent concepts like royalty, unity and legacy.
Sophia Dawson, a Brooklyn-based visual artist, took the second word, lives. The “L” contains the faces of the mothers who have lost their children to police killings. The “I” uses imagery inspired by Emory Douglas, an artist for the Black Panther Party; the “V” highlights the culture of the African diaspora; the “E” contains faces of Black Panther Party members who are in prison; and the “S” carries a passage from the Bible.
The street painting at New York City’s Foley Square resembles many that have been done around the country in its word choice and placement, but part of what has been lost in the national debate over the art and the political statements they make is the logistical care, intentional placement and artistry that went into the creation of many of them.
While some like those at Trump Tower and near the White House are primarily stencil work in the blazing yellow paint typically used for road markings, and are known largely for their challenging placement, others have been fully realized works of art that went through rigorous processes of design and planning.
This month, the Foley Square street art in Lower Manhattan and the one in Harlem were unveiled, with the multicolored letters of Black Lives Matter replete with imagery related to Black people who were killed by the police, as well as vibrant symbols of freedom, hope and joy.
In Cincinnati, the art appears in the red, black and green of the Pan-African flag, with silhouettes, phrases and textured designs filling the letters. In Jackson, Michigan, it was designed it in a graffiti-style font. In Portland, Oregon, the letters contained a timeline of historical injustices in the state.
The purpose of the Fifth Avenue project at Trump Tower was clear: to rile up the president, who called it a “symbol of hate.” The street painting was intended to get the message up quickly; the stenciling and outlining was done by the Department of Transportation, and roughly 60 volunteers helped lay down 100 gallons of traffic paint.
The other artworks in Manhattan were intended not as a political statement meant for President Donald Trump to see but as an opportunity for local artists, community togetherness and discussions about race and policing. The outlines of the enlarged “Black Lives Matter” letters are filled with intentionally placed symbols and colors.
“I wanted the design to embody our experience as a whole as a Black community and what we strive for,” said Patrice Payne, one of the artists involved with the work at Foley Square.
Justin Garrett Moore, the executive director of the city’s Public Design Commission, said that there is a clear difference between the street paintings borne from mayoral decision making, which serve as an acknowledgment that public officials have heard the calls of racial justice protesters, and the community-driven murals, where there’s a deeper connection to the space and the message.
“These are Black communities that are really wanting to have an expression for this historic moment that we’re in,” he said.
It happened to be a work near the White House, spearheaded by the mayor of Washington, Muriel E. Bowser, that set the groundwork for the countrywide spilling of paint on the ground.
After the Washington painting made the news, an organization representing small business owners in Harlem, called Harlem Park to Park, started discussing what their version of a Black Lives Matter artwork would look like.
There was a certain expectation that Harlem, known as the epicenter of Black culture, needed to take the trend a level up, said Nikoa Evans-Hendricks, the group’s executive director. The result was two sprawling sets of words on either side of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, between 125th and 127th Streets. On the northbound side, eight artists had creative control over two letters each. The southbound side was painted red, black and green by a collection of community groups.
“We wanted to make sure the mural didn’t just represent words on the street but embodied the Harlem community,” Evans-Hendricks said.
The artists were chosen by LeRone Wilson, the artwork’s curator, who also designed the first two letters. The “B” that he designed depicts the Ancient Kemetic goddess Ma’at, with feathered wings reaching across the curves of the letter, and the bird deity Heru, welcoming the spirits of those who have died at the hands of police into the universe.
Within the “L,” he painted the names of 24 Black people killed by the police, including George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown and Amadou Diallo.
Within the outlines of several other letters, the artists painted images associated with the outrage over the treatment of Black people by the police: The faces of Taylor and Sandra Bland and Floyd’s daughter occupy the two “T”s in the word “matter.” The “I” in “lives” contains the badge numbers of the four police officers charged in connection with Floyd’s death.
The artists received advice from the city’s Department of Transportation on what materials to use on the asphalt. They took the agency’s recommendation of using road line paint used for markings on streets and sidewalks, which many artists right now are doing to make the street art more durable.
The act of painting the work in Harlem was designed as a community event, with catering from local restaurants and help painting from the Boys and Girls Club of Harlem and Harlem Little League.
“Every day we were out there, hundreds of people wanted to be involved,” Wilson said.
And after the unveiling, the space became a gathering place for people, as well as a space to appreciate art at a time when museums are shut because of the pandemic.
The creators are hoping that the city agrees to a request to keep the street closed to traffic until the end of the summer, as the city did with a mural in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, which was created with the yellow traffic paint and contains the names of Black people killed by the police.
The location for the Harlem work was chosen because it was at the heart of a Black community. In Lower Manhattan at Foley Square, it was because of a nearby cherished national monument: It draws meaning from its proximity to the African Burial Ground, which contains the remains of New York City’s colonial African American community.
Amina Hassen, an urban planner with WXY, an architectural and urban design firm that worked on the project, said that the location along Centre Street, near the state and federal court buildings, was also significant because of its connection to the policing and incarceration of Black people.
As with the Harlem work, the artists of the Foley Square project had control over the designs within the outline of the “Black Lives Matter” letters, but the city still had to review the designs to make sure they complied with safety standards. (This time the artists were chosen by the Department of Cultural Affairs, and the project was shepherded by Gale A. Brewer, Manhattan borough president, and Black Lives Matter of Greater New York.)
They first blocked out the artwork in 3D software, carefully avoiding any street features that the Department of Transportation said they couldn’t paint over, said Jhordan Channer, the architectural designer for the project. When it came time to install the 600-foot-long paiting, they first painted a white canvas and a drop shadow to make sure the letters stood out. Tats Cru, a group of professional muralists in the city, executed the artists’ designs with heavy-duty traffic paint, exterior-grade enamel paint and spray paint. They were assisted by youth from Thrive Collective, an arts mentoring program that works with New York public schools.
For the last word, “matters,” Payne started in the “M” with the image of a Black woman as an ancestral figure and nurturer. The design progresses to images of broken shackles, a raised fist, a sun peeking out behind storm clouds, with a tattered American flag at the forefront.
Since the first street painting was unveiled in Washington, some segments of the Black Lives Matter movement have criticized them as being purely symbolic gestures from politicians at a time when activists are calling for the defunding of police departments.
The artists and designers behind the community-driven works say that there are important uses for this symbolism, like education and providing meaningful public art commissions by Black artists.
Evans-Hendricks remembers seeing a mother walking her son down the letters of the Harlem street art, which run between 14 and 16 feet wide, and explaining the meaning of each word.
“It has come alive in a way that the community really needed,” she said.
But they also recognize the limits of the works and hope that the solidarity coming from politicians goes beyond paint on the street.
“I’m very interested in the art going up and taking my child to visit it and discuss it,” Dawson said. “But I’m more interested in the tangible change that must come from this.”

Black Artists on How to Change Classical Music [With graphic(s)]

With their major institutions founded on white European models and obstinately focused on the distant past, classical music and opera have been even slower than American society at large to confront racial inequity. Black players make up less than 2% of the nation’s orchestras; the Metropolitan Opera still has yet to put on a work by a Black composer.
The protests against police brutality and racial exclusion that have engulfed the country since the end of May have encouraged individuals and organizations toward new awareness of long-held biases and provided new motivation to change. Nine Black performers spoke with The New York Times about steps that could be taken to begin transforming a white-dominated field. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.
Bassoonist Monica Ellis
The first step is admitting that these organizations are built on a white framework built to benefit white people. Have you done the work to create a structure that is actually benefiting Black and brown communities? When that occurs, diversity is a natural byproduct. There needs to be intentional hiring of qualified Black musicians who you know are going to bring the goods to your audiences. Intentionally adding qualified Black board members to your organization — that’s going to allow access to these communities you need to bring into the circle. Administratively, people who are in the room will bring different perspectives. Chamber groups like mine, Imani Winds, have the ability to be more nimble; we can make our own rules and make our own platforms. As a chamber presenter, you can support groups that bring Blackness and diversity in their programs.
Conductor Thomas Wilkins
It’s incumbent upon leadership from the podium to be part of this: who gets hired, what repertory gets played, where the orchestra plays. If you’re not willing, for example, to have minority music interns playing subscription concerts because they didn’t take the audition, that doesn’t make any sense to me. This person needs the opportunity to play this repertoire; you have to be willing to let that happen, and you can’t bow to blowback from the full-time players.
In Philadelphia, for a community concert, they once found a high school that was acoustically inferior; aesthetically, no comparison; the chorus in the audience behind me. It made no sense, except for the joy it brought to that community to have the Philadelphia Orchestra in their backyard. They want some sense that they count and they matter, and by going there, it’s us saying, “Yes, you do.”
Composer Jessie Montgomery
I’m in my fifth year on the board of Chamber Music America, and more than half the board is people of color. It’s very evenly balanced as far as gender and race; those changes were implemented through consulting work and training and facilitated discussions among the board to make sure everyone was on the same page. Going through that process has been eye-opening and proves how much time it takes. Now we are equipped to have these discussions about how this can trickle down to membership and granting opportunities. And I think presenting organizations need to take the time to get to know the artists. Getting to know new artists takes time and commitment; it’s a commitment to widen your perspective.
Conductor Roderick Cox
I would like changes to be made in how we train musicians in conservatories and universities. A lot of our thinking and our perceptions of what’s good music becomes indoctrinated at that stage. I say this because even though I’m a person of color, I was guilty of not being accepting of new voices and styles outside of Beethoven, Schumann, all the usual music of the past. When we start with preconceived notions, we limit ourselves. People are afraid of being uncomfortable, but with discomfort comes growth. If students learn about composers like William Grant Still or Florence Price — and their approaches to making music — then they will become more versatile. And we will see that change taking place in our programming; schools won’t just be producing conductors who want to do Wagner, Strauss and Mahler. I love these composers. But there are more voices to hear.
Clarinetist Anthony McGill
Over the last month, you’ve seen all these outpourings, and it’s in these moments when you see: Are we really connected with the communities we’re doing this work in? At the New York Philharmonic, where I am principal clarinet, I think there’s been incentive to partner up with the Harmony Program, which does after-school music education. I’m doing the Music Advancement Program at Juilliard; the mission revolves around students from underserved communities. It’s being a citizen in that way. The new way is actually getting on the ground and teaching, getting on the ground and having tough conversations about the state of our field and who we’re trying to reach, being there to help people understand that the orchestra is there for them.
Singer Lawrence Brownlee
Artistic institutions need to be focused on representing and really serving the communities that they’re in. There needs to be community engagement, not community outreach. Outreach is something you do occasionally. But you’re always in the act of engaging; it’s a constant effort. If there are changes in the administration and the makeup of the board — every level of every artistic organization — that will spill into how this stuff is packaged. This is the beginning of change that can be meaningful. If we reinvent what the opera or classical music audience is, we won’t have the disparities in people hired, people attending, even what’s presented, because you will have different people coming up with new ideas.
Composer Terence Blanchard
It’s like anything else: The organizations need to represent what America looks like. Well-intentioned people can just have blinders on. I don’t look at it like a sinister plot; I look at it as, people are going with what they’re comfortable with. If we had more representation in the leadership, in terms of who is signing off on projects, you’ll have more people bringing things to the table. What I saw at Opera Theater of St. Louis — where I did “Champion” and “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” which is going to the Met — is, those people are open to a lot of ideas. But we have to bring the ideas to them. We have to open their eyes. I really think in the art music world, people are clamoring for something different. When we did “Champion” in New Orleans, this African American guy in his 70s said, “If this is opera, I will come.” That’s a new audience member we didn’t have before. “La Bohème” doesn’t mean anything to him. But these contemporary stories do.
Singer Latonia Moore
Please, in the future, cast with your heart, not just with your eyes and your ears. Who gives you the goose bumps? Pick them. Some people see a Black tenor, and they think Otello. Or they see a Black soprano, and they think Aida. “Who wants to see a Black Cio-Cio San?” You’ll hear that. But yes, opera is a suspension of disbelief. When someone does “Eugene Onegin,” they will often cast someone Russian or fluent in Russian. It doesn’t have to be who you expect. There are other people who can sing it. When it comes to “Otello,” you could paint everyone blue and paint Desdemona green. When it comes down to it, it’s not about color; it’s about difference.
Composer Tania León
Certain groups of people have felt that they did not belong, because most of the time they didn’t see people who resembled them onstage. But even if things look good onstage, internally is that what is happening in the institution? It’s a family type of thing. That person working in the office goes home and tells the people at home, and they usually have other friends. That is how audiences change. It has to be from the inside out. And if the stage reflects the society, you can find the best artists to be the ambassadors to those coming and put them in front of the people. It could be the administrator, the person in charge of programming or a member of the orchestra. People have to address the audience, to let them feel “I am one of you.” And you will see, the whole thing will change like you have no idea.

Seeing ‘Black Lives Matter’ Written in Chalk, One City Declares It a Crime [With graphic(s)]

SELAH, Wash. — First came the warning: A police officer in the small city of Selah, Washington, told a group of young people that if they continued drawing “Black Lives Matter” chalk art on the sidewalk in front of City Hall, they would be charged with a crime.
Then came the pressure washer.
As the 10 protesters covered parts of their artwork with their bodies, a city worker walked between them, spraying away the exposed parts of their messages and sending tubs of chalk tumbling into the street. The young activists, wet from the washing, watched in silence and held up signs that were outside the reach of the pressure washer.
“Hate has no home in Selah,” one of them said.
The standoff last week was just one of a growing series of conflicts between conservative leaders of Selah, a central Washington community with only a few dozen Black residents, and young people from a wide range of backgrounds who believe the city is long overdue for a conversation about race.
As Black Lives Matter events spread from urban centers to thousands of smaller communities around the country, town officials who saw little reason to explore percolating racial prejudices are finding themselves confronted by residents who have decided it is time to step forward.
In Selah, where rich soils on the dry side of the Cascades have nurtured a global fruit-growing industry, city officials profess to be perplexed about the sudden activism. The city administrator, Don Wayman, said he did not see any racial issues to address, calling the Black Lives Matter movement “devoid of intellect and reason” and characterizing the activists as a “mob.”
Chalk art has long been a tableau for social activism, a form of instant commentary that takes political expression quite literally onto the streets. Cities have at times targeted it, such as in San Diego, where a man was charged with 13 counts of vandalism in 2013 for writing anti-bank messages on a public sidewalk. A jury acquitted him.
The issue has also come up before in Washington state. A prosecutor in Ferry County filed charges against a political activist for chalk messages she wrote on a walkway leading into a meeting of county commissioners in 2018, according to court records. The judge later dismissed the charge, and a federal judge has since noted that while the state’s “malicious mischief” law prohibits writing on public buildings, it does not directly address public walkways.
Selah’s chalk activism began with Gabriel Fabian, 20, who was not politically active until after seeing the video capturing the arrest in May that led to George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. Fabian, who is Latino, decided he needed to play a role in halting the oppression of Black people and that it would need to start at home.
“I basically said, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” Fabian said.
In early June, he began drawing the words “Black Lives Matter” on the street outside his home, which lies on a dead end. He included references to Black people whose deaths in recent years around the country have sparked protests over racial injustice.
By the end of the week, a city crew came by with a street sweeper to clean it off.
Some friends came by to draw more, and a cleaning crew again washed them off. They did it again. Then again.
At one point, a letter from Police Chief Richard Hayes arrived addressed to Fabian’s older brother. It said the chalk drawing “is, by definition, graffiti” and could result in a citation.
Fabian’s mother, Laura Perez, said it was clear to her that the city’s crackdown had everything to do with the content of the message and the fact that it was produced outside the home of a Latino family. To her, it reinforced everything she had felt about the town since moving her family there from California eight years ago.
She had already seen her children being profiled at school. She had been surprised that the district offered little in Spanish despite the large number of Latinos who had settled in the region, originally drawn by agricultural work but now an integral part of many communities in eastern Washington. While her boys were told not to wear rosaries at school, they noticed that white students were not confronted when they wore similar items.
She said the family was stunned to see the Confederate flag openly flown by some people in the community and emblems of it worn at school.
Still, Perez said she wanted to be a good neighbor in her overwhelmingly white neighborhood, and she worried that when the young people started drawing the chalk art that the military veteran who lived across the street might frown upon their work.
After the letter from the police chief, the family had a lawyer respond, objecting to the city’s handling of the art. Rob Case, Selah’s municipal attorney, responded with a more detailed warning, saying the drawings were a violation of the malicious mischief statute “that is punishable by 364 days in jail and a $5,000 fine.”
The city insisted that it had a policy of cleaning away any chalk art it found, no matter the message, though Perez said she had seen no efforts to remove recent chalk art tied to school graduations.
Wayman, the city administrator, has told other Selah leaders that he wants to protect the city from the “mayhem and evil” seen in places like Seattle, where a series of protests led to confrontations between Black Lives Matter protesters and police.
At one of Selah’s own Black Lives Matter events, Wayman acknowledged, he told a council member from nearby Yakima that Selah had not had problems at its protests because the city has such a high rate of concealed-carry gun owners.
The lawyer working with Fabian’s family, Joseph Cutler, said that the city’s targeted cleaning of the protest messages amounted to an infringement on free speech.
Courtney Hernandez, who is Black and has been organizing Black Lives Matter events in the area, said it was clear to her that the city was attempting to silence protest. She grew up in Selah, she said, and knows that it has not always been welcoming to people of color.
Yet Hernandez said she was in tears during the first rally she organized in Selah because of how many people showed up. More people showed up at later events, which often now feature new chalk art.
Fabian said several white neighbors have invited him now to draw on their driveways, out of reach of the city’s pressure washers.
One of them, Carmen Garrison, said that after seeing what was happening out on the street, she knocked on Fabian’s door. Because of her age and concerns about the coronavirus, she said, she has not attended the demonstrations, but the artwork on her driveway was an opportunity to show her support for changes in the community that she said were overdue.
“I think Selah’s a little behind the times,” Garrison said. “They need to get with the program.”
The unexpected support from various corners of the community has led Perez to reassess what she now sees as her own implicit biases. White people in town, she said, have surprised her with the extent of their vocal support; even the military veteran who lives across the street — the one she feared might oppose the chalk drawings — has told her he is in their corner.
“They showed us that we were wrong,” Perez said. “People found their voice.”

Matt Pearson was born in Washington, D.C., in 1983, which means he is old enough to remember watching his hometown football team win their second Super Bowl in 1988. He remembers the smell of chips and beer, his parents screaming like crazy at the television, the team’s record-breaking comeback and victory.
After that, said Pearson, who is now an industrial designer, “my level of football fanhood was complete and devotional.”
By the time he could turn the television on himself, “there was nothing that would take me away from Sundays with the Washington football team,” he said. “At that time I called them the Redskins. I was obsessed.”
When first confronted with the idea that the team’s name was racist, around the time he was in middle school, Pearson, who is Black, said: “My brain couldn’t handle it.” But as he grew up, and his politics began to develop, he turned against the name and the league, both of which he found increasingly unacceptable. He no longer watches professional football.
Still, his house, like the homes of many people who grew up in D.C. at the time — including that of my own family; we are friendly with the Pearsons — was once littered with jerseys and memorabilia, including limited-edition Super Bowl victory Coke cans that featured the team’s logo. In my own childhood home, there is still a collector’s edition Redskins-branded Monopoly game, made in 2005.
The team chose to change its name this week, a decision that had been urged for decades by Native American activists and groups but forced by major sponsors including Nike and FedEx. The change will transform jerseys and memorabilia from the merchandise of an active team to artifacts of its racist former name. (On Thursday, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and other forms of abuse within the team’s organization were reported by The Washington Post.)
Since the death of George Floyd in police custody in late May set off protests against racism throughout the country, brands including Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben’s have reconsidered the racist imagery they use to sell products. But while those images are affixed to disposable food items, the Redskins name and logo appear on innumerable pieces of merchandise that fans had no plans to get rid of. Some of them are old items that hadn’t been given much thought. Others are souvenirs and keepsakes with significant meaning to their owners.
The millions of people from D.C., Maryland and Virginia who supported or support the local team, whether enthusiastically or reluctantly, are going to have to decide: What will happen to all their Redskins gear?
‘That Was Our Team’
Among those encouraging people to re-evaluate their relationships with their branded belongings are former Redskins players. Darrell Green, a Washington legend and pro football Hall-of-Famer who holds the league’s record for most consecutive seasons with an interception, told ESPN this week that he would consider throwing away his old jerseys and memorabilia.
He elaborated in an interview with The New York Times, saying that now was the time to look to a better future instead of clinging to nostalgia.
“We shouldn’t have longings for something that is past, that is a jersey or a moment, that is to the detriment of living people,” he said, referring to Native American communities. “My millions, my trophies, my videos, my jerseys, my stuff, it’s not worth it. My vantage point is that human beings come first.”
Some fans are rushing to rid themselves of their gear. Patrick Casady, 25, lives in Maryville, Missouri, but chose to root for the Washington NFL team when he was young because he liked their colors and connected with the players of that era.
I contacted him through eBay, where he was selling a jersey of quarterback Robert Griffin III, who was for a time the bright shining hope of the D.C. Metropolitan area.
“I always knew growing up that the name was racist. No one ever did anything about it for the longest time, it was just kind of there,” Casady said.
Eventually, he stopped wearing his many jerseys outside of the house. “You kind of feel a little awkward in it honestly,” he said. “You know that, I personally would never say it to a person of Indian descent or anything. So that shows you that it’s not good, it’s racist.”
But many fans of the team say that they will continue to proudly sport the team’s logo and name. In a thread on the team’s official message board asking whether participants would continue to wear their old gear, more than 40 respondents said they would, about twice as many as those who said they would not.
“Yes absolutely will wear my Redskin gear! Never considered it racist! And still don’t!” said one, who identified himself as an electrician who has been rooting for the team since 1968.
Jeff Rinehart Jr., 40, from Virginia Beach, Virginia, said that he inherited a love of the team from his father, who died in 1998. He is a member of a charitable foundation associated with the team, the HogFarmers, which supports children with cancer and their families.
Rhinehart started attending games in 2001, and said that going made him feel closer to his father. He does not plan to stop wearing his team gear, he said.
Jesenia Clepper, 41, will not only continue to sport the logo and the team name but is also making and selling her own shirts prominently displaying them. When we spoke, she said she was wearing a T-shirt with the team’s logo over an American flag, as well as a branded wristwatch.
She said that she grew up extremely poor in Houston, and that she and her nine siblings, including her brother Roosevelt, did what they could to entertain themselves without spending money.
“We played football and we were the Redskins and the Cowboys,” she said. “That was back in ’83. We just adopted the Redskins into our lives and that was our team.” (The team won its first Super Bowl in 1983).
Then in 1989, Roosevelt had an aneurysm, which permanently changed his behavior and cognitive abilities, Clepper said, choking up as she told the story. For her, the team is a reminder of a happier time. She does not see its name as racist. (Clepper is Hispanic.)
“I can’t even put it in my head that people actually think that we as fans wear Redskins attire as a form of hate or to disparage Native Americans,” she said, contrasting the symbol with the Confederate flag, which she said was a racist symbol.
The decision to change the name has broken her heart, and she is now “done with the NFL,” she said. “No more football for me.”
Shame and Preservation
Innumerable pieces of branded merchandise are churned out on behalf of professional football teams each year. A person familiar with the NFL’s licensing operation who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the league, estimated that in the past 20 years, about $700 million worth of Washington NFL gear had been sold nationally.
Some of the merchandise associated with the team now belongs to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, in Big Rapids, Michigan. The museum’s curator, David Pilgrim, said that he has collected memorabilia devoted to various sports teams with names that invoked Native American people over the years, including about a dozen items devoted to the Washington team.
Pilgrim said that the name change would provide fans with an opportunity to question what was in their closets.
“A fan’s attachment to a jersey can’t be the compelling factor here,” Pilgrim said. “I’m not going to tell people what to do with them but if they visited our museum, one of the questions I would ask is, ‘Why do you keep them?’”
Museums don’t have the capacity — or necessarily the desire — to store unending amounts of Washington-branded merchandise. Hunter Old Elk, a curator at the Indians Plains Museum in Cody, Wyoming, and an Indigenous woman of the Crow and Yakama Nations, said that what should be done with old gear was a complicated question.
“I think there are a couple of examples that could be used in interpretation,” she said. But the vast majority, “since they’re still mass produced, there’s not a lot of value historically in them.”
She said that it would be left to fans to decide whether to save or dispose of their belongings, which she called “images of a continued systemic racism.” She didn’t have high hopes that they would throw them out. She expected them to become similar to symbols of the Confederacy, proud taboos for those who continue to hold on to them.
Lyra Monteiro, a professor at Rutgers University who studies how cultural artifacts can help us understand American history, also saw that as a possible outcome. She said that when people were compelled to recognize that something is offensive to others, particularly when that thing has emotional import, “what mostly comes out as a reaction to that is anger and defensiveness.”
She said that it was a no-brainer that people would have a hard time letting go of the gear, especially given what it meant to their childhoods. Emotional bonds help a culture perpetuate itself.
But Monteiro, an archaeologist by training, said that the tendency to erase all evidence of objects that had been recognized as racist or otherwise offensive only contributed to further ignorance.
She cited the history of blackface, which she said could be difficult for her students to understand as a problem because they so rarely encountered it before it surfaced in recent political scandals.
She was hopeful that for some fans, the confrontation forced by the name change “can be the deepest and most profound learning opportunity.”
“You know the power of that cultural product, because of what it means to you,” she said. “That can be what drives you to dig into it more deeply.”
Pearson said that he thinks many of his old jerseys have been donated. But he said that he could see some benefit to keeping an item or two of apparel, even if it seemed like “a relic from another time.”
Its purpose: “To remind myself of my own fervor,” he said. “Just to remember how much your views can change.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — First, a gunman shot a 23-year-old man in the leg Monday afternoon in eastern Brooklyn, then fled in a red SUV.
Two hours later, five people were wounded within 20 minutes in drive-by attacks nearby. That evening, a bullet hit a 51-year-old bystander in the arm when someone pulled a gun during a dispute in a housing project a few miles away.
Those shootings are unsolved. Police say the violence this week stemmed from an escalating feud between two gangs — the kind of conflict that investigators believe is driving a summertime surge in shootings unlike anything the city has seen in more than two decades.
The recent spike, which included the killing of a baby hit by a stray bullet at a barbecue, has spurred growing and unusually harsh recriminations between some elected officials and the leadership of the police department, which is grappling with one of its biggest crises in years.
Arrest numbers have plummeted even as shootings have spiraled up, and some elected officials contend that rank-and-file police officers are staging a work slowdown in response to protests over police brutality and systemic racism that erupted after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
But senior police commanders say they believe that their inability to curb the shootings stems from the need to shift police resources to the protests, as well as a hostile political climate that has made officers reluctant to carry out arrests because of what they see as unfair scrutiny of their conduct.
Gun violence typically rises in summer, as warmer weather draws more people outside and tempers flare in the heat. But this year, the violence has been especially fierce in cities across the country: The coronavirus outbreak has deepened the endemic problems that often underlie gun violence, including poverty, unemployment, housing instability and hunger, experts on crime said.
“What we’re seeing is almost a perfect storm,” said Michael Sean Spence, policy and implementation director at Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit group. “The pandemic has exacerbated the root causes of gun violence.”
At the same time, the unrest has eroded trust in the police, who depend heavily on the cooperation of witnesses and victims, at a time when departments are facing budget cuts to help cities offset the costs of fighting the pandemic, said Tom Scott, a social scientist in the policing research program at RTI International, a research nonprofit.
Along with New York, shootings have risen in other big cities, including Chicago, Houston, Atlanta and Denver. The wave of violence has become enmeshed in a heated national debate over the future of policing after Floyd’s death.
In New York City, the shootings showed no signs of slowing this week. Police said at least 44 people were shot between Monday and early Thursday morning, including a 16-year-old wounded as he walked down East 43rd Street in Brooklyn.
Police commanders have said that their response to the shootings has been hampered for several reasons.
For starters, as the protests gained momentum, the police commissioner, Dermot Shea, disbanded the plainclothes “anti-crime” units, which in the past targeted people carrying illegal guns, because the units had been involved in many police shootings that sparked public outrage.
At the same time, the pandemic’s toll on the force and the need to shift investigators to help cover protests strained resources, setting back investigations. Fewer shootings are being solved this summer than in previous years, compounding the cycle of violence, as assailants remain free to strike again or to become targets of retaliation.
“One shooting is turning into another shooting, is turning into another shooting, is turning to another shooting because we are unable to make an arrest,” the chief of detectives, Rodney Harrison, said.
There were 634 shootings through July 12, compared with only 396 in the same period last year, according to police data. Police have made arrests in 23% of shootings so far this year, Harrison said, well below the usual clearance rate, which is just above 30%.
At the height of the pandemic, more than 7,000 officers — almost 20% of the force — were out sick, and hundreds of investigators were pulled from detective squads onto social distancing patrols and, later, to help cover protests in late May and early June. Many have just returned to their original assignments investigating gang and drug activity.
Arrests have declined drastically this summer, falling by 62% for the last four weeks compared with the same period last year, police data show. Narcotics arrests fell 85%. Detectives in the gang unit made 90% fewer arrests. There were similarly steep drops in the number of arrests by officers that patrol the subways and housing projects.
Gun arrests have dropped 67% during the same four weeks compared with last year, even as shootings have continued to spiral upward.
Some public officials who represent hard-hit parts of the city have accused the police of pulling back from their most basic responsibility — keeping the public safe — in response to the protests.
Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and a former city police captain, said he has asked the mayor and police commissioner to investigate response times to determine whether rank-and-file police officers are conducting a work slowdown.
“I’m getting too many calls from different parts of the city where people are saying we’re not getting police responding to our calls,” he said.
Adams said one young woman, for instance, had told him that police had not responded to her complaints about dice games that led to daily fights and arguments. A man also complained that police dismissed him when he asked them to address people playing loud music at night.
Donovan J. Richards, the City Council member from southeast Queens who is chairman of the public safety committee, said he had received similar complaints.
“Right now, communities are being held hostage by the cops and the robbers at the same time,” he said. “And it’s unfair to the folks who want a safe street but who also want safe, fair policing. There’s no contradiction in asking for the two.”
The Police Department said in a statement that its officers “are here today, and they will be here tomorrow, fulfilling their essential mission to protect life and property.”
But senior commanders have acknowledged morale among officers is low after weeks of protests and anti-police rhetoric, which led to the passage of laws aimed at ending the use of chokeholds and making disciplinary records public.
The recent arrests of two officers on charges they used unnecessary force have also discouraged some officers. Hundreds of officers have put in their retirement papers in the weeks since the protests began.
“The truth about the cops is, they’re a little off balance, because they don’t know where the floor or the ceiling is anymore,” said one senior police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Chief Terence Monahan, the top uniformed official, said in a radio interview that many officers are fearful they may be arrested if they take “proactive” steps to stop crime.
“There is a feeling on the street that the police are handcuffed, that they are not out there as aggressively as we were in the past,” he told 1010 WINS news.
The police are trying to address the backlog in shooting investigations by shifting 250 former anti-crime officers to detective squads, where Harrison said the officers’ knowledge of the neighborhoods where they worked can be used to help identify people involved in shootings, especially now that many people wear masks.
Mayor Bill de Blasio also announced plans Wednesday to step up police patrols in Brooklyn neighborhoods most affected by the recent shootings and to employ nonprofits that use former gang members to mediate disputes.
“This is the way forward,” he said.
Even in the best of times, shootings can be notoriously difficult to solve, detectives say. Victims and witnesses are often distrustful of police and sometimes turn down detectives’ pleas for help.
Some witnesses believe in street justice and a code in which people who cooperate with authorities are branded snitches. Others fear they or their loved ones might be harmed if they come forward.
Some 2,000 shooting cases remain open and unsolved, including the killing of a man who was shot last week while walking with his 6-year-old daughter in the Bronx.
Police are also still searching for two gunmen who opened fire at a graduation party in the Bronx, killing a 19-year-old woman, and the assailant who shot a 17-year-old boy in the head in East Harlem.
Almost all the shooting victims so far this year have been Black or Latino, and more than half were men ages 18-30, according to police.
Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said shootings in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, like the one that claimed the life of 1-year-old Davell Gardner on Sunday, warranted a stronger response from police.
“Those are the type of incidents where you say this guy’s got to caught in the next 24, 48 hours,” he said. “The pain of a mother on Madison Street in Brooklyn is the same pain a mother would feel on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.”
Lamar Gibson, 17, was shot in the head and killed shortly before midnight Monday in the courtyard of the Washington Houses in East Harlem. He had hoped to become an engineer, his mother, LaToya Jack, said.
Lamar’s father had been killed almost 10 years ago on the same block, Jack said. The killers were never found.
“You know how it feels to look at the same detectives who couldn’t figure out who killed your children’s father, and now you’re putting your son, the same delicate situation, in their hands?” she asked.

Full text: It was two hours after curfew on the sixth night of protests against police brutality in New York City.
An officer in Brooklyn pushed a protester so hard that she fell backward on the pavement. Then he shoved someone on a bicycle and picked up and body-slammed a third person into the street.
Nearby, a man fell running from the police. Officers swarmed him and beat him with batons. A commanding officer, in his white-shirted uniform, joined the fray and stepped on the man's neck.
All of it was caught on video. In fact, The New York Times found more than 60 videos that show the police using force on protesters during the first 10 days of demonstrations in the city after the death of George Floyd.
A review of the videos, shot by protesters and journalists, suggests that many of the police attacks, often led by high-ranking officers, were not warranted.
A video of five or 10 or 30 seconds does not tell the whole story, of course. It does not depict what happened before the camera started rolling. It is unclear from the videos, for instance, what the officers' intentions were or why protesters were being arrested or told to move.
But the Police Department's patrol guide says officers may use "only the reasonable force necessary to gain control or custody of a subject." Force, policing experts say, must be proportionate to the threat or resistance at hand at the moment it is applied.
In instance after instance, the police are seen using force on people who do not appear to be resisting arrest or posing an immediate threat to anyone.
Officers attacked people who had their hands up.
They hit people who were walking away from them.
They grabbed people from behind.
And they repeatedly pummeled people who were already on the ground.
Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea has maintained that misconduct during the protests was confined to "isolated cases" and that officers were confronted with violence by protesters.
He noted that during the first few days of demonstrations, people looted businesses, burned police cars and attacked officers with bricks, bottles and in one case a fire extinguisher, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to impose an 8 p.m. curfew.
"I think the officers used an incredible amount of restraint in terms of allowing people to vent," Commissioner Shea said on June 22. "I am proud of their performance in policing these protests, ending the riots and upholding the rule of law."
Yet for just about each viral moment that emerged from the protests -- officers violently shoving a woman to the ground or beating a cyclist who seemed to be doing nothing more than trying to cross the street -- The Times turned up multiple examples of similar behavior.
The police responded to words with punches and pepper spray.
Officers charged into peaceful crowds and pushed people to the ground.
Sometimes, they appeared to lash out at random.
Devora Kaye, the Police Department's assistant commissioner for public information, declined repeated requests to review the full set of videos provided by The Times and to explain the use of force in them.
She reiterated that "isolated incidents" of misconduct were being addressed, noted that four officers had already been disciplined, and said that the department's Internal Affairs Bureau was investigating 51 cases of use of force during the protests.
"The N.Y.P.D. has zero tolerance for inappropriate or excessive use of force," she wrote, "but it is also critical to review the totality of the circumstances that lead to interactions where force is used."
The police said that nearly 400 officers were injured during the protests, and that 132 of the more than 2,500 people arrested reported injuries, but that they did not have records of injured people who were not arrested. Protesters have described and documented at least five broken or fractured bones and four concussions.
When presented with the videos collected by The Times, Kapil Longani, counsel to Mr. de Blasio, said, "These incidents are disturbing and New Yorkers deserve a full accounting of these matters and access to a transparent disciplinary process."
But he cautioned that the police disciplinary system needed time to carry out thorough investigations.
"To conclude that these officers or any American committed a crime without due process is inconsistent with the fundamental fairness that underlies our judicial system," Mr. Longani said.
The Police Benevolent Association, the union that represents most N.Y.P.D. officers, declined to comment on the videos.
The episodes in the videos The Times reviewed were spread across 15 neighborhoods in three boroughs. Several videos each were taken June 3 in Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn and on June 4 in Mott Haven in the Bronx, when officers "kettled" protesters into tight spaces and then beat them with batons.
Philip M. Stinson, a Bowling Green State University criminologist and former police officer who studies the use of force by the police, offered a blunt assessment of the behavior shown in these videos.
"A lot of this was 'street justice,"' he said, "gratuitous acts of extrajudicial violence doled out by police officers on the street to teach somebody a lesson."
Sometimes, the police went after people already in custody.
Sometimes officers went after people they did not appear interested in arresting at all.
Mr. Stinson said that in some of the videos, the police used force permissibly. He saw nothing inappropriate, for example, in a widely viewed video of officers using batons on people who appeared to be trying to evade arrest.
In many other videos, though, he said he believed that force had been applied without discipline or supervision.
"Some of the stuff that they do is so sloppy," he said. "Some of it is just downright criminal."
Scott Hechinger, a public defender for nearly a decade in Brooklyn, said he found it striking that being filmed by crowds of protesters did not seem to inhibit some officers' conduct.
"That the police were able and willing to perform such brazen violence when surrounded by cellphone cameras and when the whole world was watching at this moment more than any other, underscores how police feel and know they will never be held to account in any meaningful way even for the most egregious acts of violence," Mr. Hechinger said.
Many of the videos show violence led by officers in white shirts, signaling a rank of lieutenant or higher.
In Manhattan on June 2, one commander shoved a protester and another pulled her down by the hair.
A civil rights lawyer with the legal aid group the Bronx Defenders, Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, said she saw violations of constitutional rights in nearly all the videos, including the rights to free speech and due process.
"The primary question is whether the force is reasonable, but you have to remember, if they're not arresting someone, they shouldn't be using any force," Ms. Borchetta said.
At several protests, the police used bicycles as weapons.
More often, they used their hands.
The protests, and the outcry over the policing of them, have already led to changes. State legislators overturned a law that kept police discipline records secret and New York City cut its police budget and broadened a ban on chokeholds. Last week, New York's attorney general, Letitia James, called for an independent commission to permanently oversee the Police Department.
But acts of force by the police are still being caught on video, more than six weeks into the protests.
Axel Hernandez, a high school teacher in New York City who on June 3 filmed an officer throwing someone down by the neck, said he felt it was important to continue to keep watch over the police.
"Part of the reason we're out here is because they were on George Floyd's neck," said Mr. Hernandez, 30. "This is exactly why we are protesting in the first place."
Troy Closson contributed reporting. Note: The videos were compiled from Times reporting and lists shared by T. Greg Doucette, Corin Faife, a crowdsourced effort started on Reddit and public responses to requests by the New York attorney general's office and the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board.

Full text: The footage was made available by appointment at a court in Minneapolis, and shows officers seemingly more concerned with controlling George Floyd's body than saving his life.
MINNEAPOLIS -- Almost from the moment George Floyd encountered the police on May 25, with a gun pointed at him, he appeared terrified and emotionally distraught, according to police camera footage that was newly made available for viewing Wednesday at a courthouse in downtown Minneapolis.
Mr. Floyd was visibly shaken, with his head down, and crying, as if he were in the throes of a panic attack, as he put his hands on the steering wheel in response to a frantic order from an officer.
He told the officers over and over that he was claustrophobic, as two officers struggled to push him to the back seat of a police vehicle. Throughout the video, he never appeared to present a physical threat to the officers, and even after he was handcuffed and searched for weapons, the officers seemed to be more concerned with controlling his body than saving his life, the footage showed.
The video offers the fullest portrait yet of the tragic events around Mr. Floyd's killing. It begins with officers driving to the scene, after a convenience store clerk called 911 and said a man had used a counterfeit $ 20 bill, and it ends showing officers on the street discussing what happened, after Mr. Floyd is driven away in an ambulance. At one point, in footage not previously seen, the officers are shown dragging Mr. Floyd to the ground after he resisted being put in the squad car.
Once he was on the ground, as Mr. Floyd again said he couldn't breathe, and asked for water, and begged for his life, Derek Chauvin, the senior officer on the scene, said, in a nonchalant, almost mocking, tone, "takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to say that."
The footage provides more detail into the action of Mr. Chauvin, who has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for keeping his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes while he gasped for life. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital.
As the minutes ticked by, and Mr. Floyd became quieter and his body went limp, one officer checked his pulse and said he couldn't find one.
Mr. Chauvin's response, uttered with no emotion, was, "uh huh."
Just before, after being told that Mr. Floyd appeared to be passing out, Mr. Chauvin appears to express more concern for his fellow officers than the man dying under his knee.
"You guys all right, though?" he said.
"My knee might be a little scratched, but I'll survive," responded another officer, Thomas Lane.
The footage was made available for viewing Wednesday to the public and media by appointment at the Hennepin County Government Center in downtown Minneapolis -- in a conference room with a dozen laptop stations -- but was not allowed to be copied or recorded.
A coalition of media organizations, including The New York Times, has petitioned the court to obtain the footage, which would allow for release to the public. Judge Peter Cahill, who is overseeing the case, will hold a hearing on the matter on Tuesday.
Mr. Floyd's family on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against four of the officers at the scene and against the City of Minneapolis, arguing that the police had violated the Fourth Amendment in killing Mr. Floyd and that the city had failed to properly dismiss problem officers and train recruits about the dangers of neck restraints.
"It was not just the knee of Derek Chauvin on George Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds," Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Mr. Floyd's family, said at a news conference. "But it was the knee of the entire Minneapolis Police Department on the neck of George Floyd that killed him."
In the lawsuit, Mr. Crump and a team of other prominent lawyers argue that the Police Department's policies had allowed for officers to use "neck restraint" techniques that could be deadly even when they were not in life-or-death situations. It also said that training materials given to officers in 2014, including Mr. Chauvin and another officer charged in Mr. Floyd's killing, show an officer placing a knee on the neck of a person who is being arrested and is handcuffed in a prone position, as Mr. Floyd was.
The lawyers said in the lawsuit that the policies and training, approved or condoned by the mayor, City Council and police chief, "were the moving force behind and caused" Mr. Floyd's death.
Erik Nilsson, the Minneapolis city attorney, said the city would review and respond to the lawsuit. A spokesman for the Police Department did not respond to an inquiry about the lawsuit's claims.
Transcripts of the body camera footage, from two of the four police officers charged in the killing of Mr. Floyd, were released last week as part of a motion on behalf of one of the junior officers, Mr. Lane, to have the case against him dismissed.
Mr. Lane, 37, was a rookie officer, and one of the first officers on the scene. His lawyer, Earl Gray, has sought to shift the blame to Mr. Chauvin, a senior officer who trained new recruits to the force, arguing that Mr. Lane was following the lead of Mr. Chauvin.
According to the transcripts and an interview Mr. Lane gave to investigators, Mr. Lane suspected that Mr. Floyd was having a medical emergency and asked Mr. Chauvin if they should turn Mr. Floyd on his side as he was facedown and gasping for breath. Mr. Lane also rode along in the ambulance to the hospital with Mr. Floyd, administering chest compressions in an attempt to revive him.
Mr. Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department, faces the most severe criminal charges, and three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. All four were fired shortly after Mr. Floyd's death. Their trial is scheduled to begin March 8.
Once an ambulance arrived -- late, because paramedics had first gone to the wrong location -- Mr. Lane went inside and administered chest compressions on Mr. Floyd, whose face appeared bloodied.
But even in the ambulance, at first, there appeared to be little sense of urgency, according to the newly seen footage, with minutes passing before anyone tended to Mr. Floyd.
Later, they strapped a mechanical chest compression device on a nearly naked Mr. Floyd, which kept pumping as Mr. Floyd's body was rising and falling.
Back at the scene, Mr. Chauvin, who had arrived later than Mr. Lane and another junior officer, J. Alexander Kueng, stood erect, his lips pursed, with his hands on his hips as Mr. Kueng, who called his superior, "sir," showed him what he believed was the fake $ 20 bill.

MOBILE, Ala. — On Tuesday evening, addressing supporters and the news media after his runaway victory in the Alabama Senate Republican primary, Tommy Tuberville wasted no time in pivoting toward his general-election opponent this fall, Sen. Doug Jones. In Jones’ Alabama, he said, “You don’t work for the United States of America — you spend your first three years trying to impeach the best president we’ve ever had. And he voted to impeach him!”
As for how Tuberville will try to frame the race against the Democratic incumbent in the months to come, his message is unlikely to get more complicated than that.
Tuberville succeeded in his primary campaign against Jeff Sessions in large part by keeping the race simple. His strategy began and ended with President Donald Trump, arguing in a bevy of television ads that a vote for his opponent was a vote against the president. And according to early conversations with his campaign staff, Tuberville plans to keep Trump front and center in the general election, reminding voters of moments like Jones’ vote against Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, in 2018, and his more recent vote against the president during his impeachment trial.
But one aide for Tuberville, speaking on the condition of anonymity, added the caveat that the campaign had yet to hold many meetings about its strategy against Jones. As with most races against Democrats in Alabama, the aide joked, there wasn’t a whole lot to talk about.
But Jones has managed to navigate the in-between realm where he is both a loyal Democrat and someone who has no problems boasting that working with Republicans and the president is often in Alabama’s interest. In an interview on Wednesday, he name-dropped the state’s senior senator, Richard Shelby, as someone whose record of representing Alabama in Washington he has tried to emulate, and pointed to the 17 bills he sponsored that Trump has signed into law.
“I have the luxury of telling people in Alabama, ‘Look, I’m going to be for President Trump on issues that are good for Alabama, and I’ve done that,’” Jones said “But on the other hand, I’m going to speak out when he’s doing things that are not good for Alabama.”
And he said he was betting that voters would appreciate his independence from the president, which is not something they can expect from Tuberville. Referring to the Republican senators in the South, Jones said: “They’ve been pretty timid. They wouldn’t speak out. And people take notice of that.”
Even in Alabama, a deeply conservative state where Trump’s approval rating is regularly the highest of any state among registered voters, a minimalist campaign strategy could undermine even a heavily favored Republican candidate.
For many Republicans here, the wounds of the last Senate race, in 2017 — in which the Republican Roy S. Moore lost a special election, to replace Sessions, to Jones after being accused of molesting underage girls — are still fresh. And while virtually every Alabama Republican believes their party will prevail in November, some fear that Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach who has never held elected office, is particularly vulnerable to the kind of scrutiny that could make the path more difficult.
If he receives that sort of attention, “then Doug Jones is going to get back in office,” predicted Cody Phillips, a member of the Republican Executive Committee for Baldwin County, east of Mobile. “Because the Democratic Party is going to attack him on all these issues.”
Those issues include questions about Tuberville’s time at the helm of a hedge fund that ended in charges of financial fraud. Tuberville’s partner in the venture was sentenced to 10 years in prison; accused of fraud as well, Tuberville reached a private settlement with investors in 2013, the details of which have not been made public.
But Terry Lathan, the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, said that one factor would still motivate voters above all else.
“It’s pretty simple, actually,” Lathan said. “Doug Jones only votes with the president 36% of the time.”
Tuberville was able to avoid on-the-spot questions about the hedge fund — about most things, really — throughout the primary race. He rarely held public events or agreed to interviews with reporters, instead focusing his campaign on substantial television ad buys that reiterated his endorsement from Trump. The Tuberville aide said the campaign would most likely do more news media and public appearances during the general election, but said it would largely depend on whether internal polling suggested they were necessary.
If Tuberville’s campaign is still lingering in the afterglow of Tuesday’s victory, Jones and the Alabama Democratic Party have hit the ground running. For Tuberville’s first morning as the Republican nominee, the senator unleashed a combative Twitter burst, and the state party let loose a torrent of criticism directed at Tuberville’s political positions and (highly successful, on the whole) football record.
They picked out his loss to Vanderbilt, a perennial underdog, in 2008 while he was the coach at Auburn University, a game that was nationally televised and an embarrassment for the football powerhouse, as well as his 36-0 loss to Alabama that year during the two universities’ annual matchup, known as the Iron Bowl. They also criticized Tuberville’s treatment, while he was at Auburn, of a player who had been charged with rape.
The morning outburst quickly sent the Alabama Democrats’ Twitter account trending nationally; the group tried to capitalize on the popularity of its tweets by including links to its ActBlue fundraising page.
Many Democrats and progressive activists celebrated Jones’ successful 2017 campaign as a teachable moment for the party, offering a template for a way out of the political wilderness in a state that a year earlier had voted for Trump by nearly 30 percentage points. These Democrats said that if only more candidates took Jones’ approach, which leaned heavily on turnout among African-American voters, they would surprise themselves with more victories in the Deep South.
But Jones probably would not have become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Alabama in a generation were it not for a unique turn of events, above all the fact that many Republicans found his opponent, Moore, so distasteful that they voted for write-in candidates instead.
And Lathan, the Alabama Republican chair, was quick to note that an overwhelming number of the state’s Republicans simply hadn’t voted in the election at all.
“If our voters show back up” in November, she said, “we’re unstoppable.” (Jones, in the interview, noted that in fact Republicans did not show up on Tuesday, when statewide turnout did not even reach 20% of registered voters.)
Jones’ considerable financial advantage in this year’s race is one of the brightest spots for his campaign, and it has allowed him to get in front of the public early with positive ads, which the Republicans have left unanswered and that stand in sharp contrast to the overwhelmingly negative ad war that played out on the Republican side in recent weeks. By one count, the Sessions-Tuberville race had the lowest share of positive ads of any Senate primary in the country.
In one such ad, Jones speaks tenderly about how George Floyd “cried for his mama” as the police suffocated him in Minneapolis. “As we witnessed his death together,” Jones says, looking into the camera, “the world changed.”
The Jones campaign appears to have enough money to keep the television ads coming. On Wednesday it said it had raised $2.7 million from the beginning of April through the end of June, and had $8.8 million in cash on hand. The Tuberville campaign, by comparison, had just $448,000 on hand, according to the most recent campaign report it filed, at the end of June.
Jones has been a prodigious fundraiser, bringing in more than $18 million overall, among the highest of the Democrats running for Senate this year. That should help cushion him in the likely event that the Democratic Party and its Senate campaign arm, under the guidance of Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, devote few resources to Alabama, choosing instead to boost candidates in states where Trump is less popular.
“The fact that Schumer’s political operation has not lifted a financial finger for Jones says it all — that he will not be returning next year,” said Scott Reed, the chief political strategist for the Republican-allied U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
But Schumer said Wednesday that Republicans underestimated Jones at their peril. “Never count Doug Jones out,” he said. “The chamber is afraid of anyone who isn’t blindly loyal to their goal of enriching special interests.”
Regardless of Jones’ prospects or national support, political observers in the state expect the race will heat up quickly, as Jones begins to aim his advertising efforts at his newly anointed general election opponent’s scant experience in politics, shallow ties to the state and troubled business record.
Palmer Hamilton, a lawyer in Mobile who has supported Alabama Republicans like Shelby and Sessions, recalled in an interview how Howell Heflin, the last Democrat to represent the state in the Senate before Jones, once described Alabama’s merciless brand of politics.
“Heflin used to say, ‘Politics in Alabama is dirty business.’ Pause. ‘When it’s done properly,’” Hamilton said. “We have a history of hardball politics. Doug and his people understand that. And they don’t plan to go soft on Tuberville.”

NEW YORK — The employees of Grandchamps, a Haitian restaurant in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, were closing up after a long, hot day of filling takeout orders in early June when the owners asked them to gather in the dining area.
The close-knit group settled in as the sun began to set and were greeted by Jason Starr, a lawyer with the Human Rights Campaign.
“Has anyone here ever been stopped by the police?” Starr asked.
Four of the six employees who were present raised their hands.
Terry McLaurin, 26, a cashier who was wearing a face mask emblazoned with the words “God is Dope,” said she had been stopped and questioned at least a dozen times.
As multiple crises were unfolding, Sabrina and Shawn Brockman, Grandchamps’ owners, decided to bring in resources to help address the intersecting needs of their employees, who are all Black.
They enlisted Starr and Dr. Surrenca Albert, a Haitian American therapist, to help their workers navigate the practical and emotional consequences of a moment when the Black community is being disproportionately affected by the coronavirus and as protests against police violence dredge up memories and anxieties of their own experiences with law enforcement. When demonstrations began in May, many of the restaurant’s employees were concerned about encountering officers on their way home from work.
“As a Black woman, I know that life is already more complicated and stressful,” said Sabrina Brockman, who is Haitian American. “I recognize that this moment is all about making progress so Black people can thrive.”
Brockman met her husband, who is white, in 2009 in Brooklyn. They married three years later and live near Grandchamps with their two children: Townes, 5, and Luella, 2.
When the couple opened Grandchamps in 2015, their intention was to operate a restaurant that treated its employees better than what Shawn Brockman had often experienced in other restaurant kitchens.
“In the restaurant industry, there’s a lot of aggressive and disrespectful behavior like yelling at people and making people feel smaller instead of working together,” said Shawn Brockman, who is the chef and runs the day-to-day operations at Grandchamps.
His wife helps manage the business and is also a senior vice president for an international mining company.
They hired mostly young Black people from the neighborhood, many of whom had been harassed by police on multiple occasions.
“Part of being a Black person in this country,” Starr said, “is that there is more than a reasonable, credible level of fear that at any point of time — whether hanging out on a stoop with friends on a summer night or going to work — there is nothing about myself that matters to a police officer in those interactions except that I am Black and that is what will define the interactions.”
During the hourlong session at Grandchamps, Starr offered advice on how to respond to police: If you are stopped on the street, you are not obligated to provide identifying information, answer questions or consent to body or property searches. Always ask if you are being detained or if you are free to go.
“There is,” he said, “dignitary harm” associated with the idea that “your identity, your very existence, is looked at like a crime.”
Albert, a friend of Sabrina Brockman’s since high school, asked the workers how they were feeling since the pandemic, the killing of George Floyd and the demonstrations.
Most of the employees said that they were doing OK. Then it was McLaurin’s turn.
“I want to be fine,” she said. “It’s not a good time to break down because we all have things to do, but are we all really fine? Because I’m not.”
“It is OK to not be OK,” Albert said. If you’re nervous about encountering police anytime you step outside, then you’re not fine, she said. For Black people, these feelings are “intertwined in everyday life, and they become normalized.”
The group then opened up, speaking more freely about their experiences with racism.
“The protests caused Black people to really face the feelings they have been carrying, and this is happening on a grand scale where no one can pretend it’s not taking place,” Albert said. “The anger, frustration, fear, confusion and despair we are experiencing now is very reminiscent of what our ancestors experienced over the course of 400 years.”
The Brockmans have held two more sessions to make sure all their employees could attend, and as part of the program several workers have started individual therapy sessions with Albert. Sabrina Brockman and Albert said they had plans to expand the program to workers at other local restaurants and businesses.
Although the program has been welcomed by Grandchamps’ employees, there aren’t easy solutions to dealing with police stops, McLaurin said after attending the session.
“It was a reality check because we live in a world where anything can happen,” she said. “It’s important to get help and to lean on people you trust.”
Antoine Saunders, 23, a cashier who attended one of the later meetings, said he had been stopped by police officers so many times he “couldn’t possibly count,” including in late June. He had entered the corner store across from his home when two plainclothes officers in an unmarked dark sedan pulled up and told Saunders and two men nearby, whom he didn’t know, to line up against the wall. An officer patted them down before telling them to go home.
“I’m so used to it that it’s just a part of everyday life,” said Saunders, a visual artist who attended four protests against police violence in the past month. “I hope that someday I can walk the streets and not be worried about the cops.”
As the protests began in late May, Sabrina Brockman entered Grandchamps carrying sheets of white paper, scissors and tape, and cut out letters and pasted them onto the window: “Black is Beautiful.”
“I wanted to make a positive message because we need to heal,” she said.

How a Famous Harvard Professor Became a Target Over His Tweets [With graphic(s)]

Steven Pinker occupies a role that is rare in American life: the celebrity intellectual. The Harvard professor pops up on outlets from PBS to the Joe Rogan podcast, translating dense subjects into accessible ideas with enthusiasm. Bill Gates called his most recent book “my new favorite book of all time.”
So when more than 550 academics recently signed a letter seeking to remove him from the list of “distinguished fellows” of the Linguistic Society of America, it drew attention to their provocative charge: that Pinker minimizes racial injustices and drowns out the voices of those who suffer sexist and racist indignities.
But the letter was striking for another reason: It took aim not at Pinker’s scholarly work but at six of his tweets dating back to 2014 and at a two-word phrase he used in a 2011 book about a centurieslong decline in violence.
“Dr. Pinker has a history of speaking over genuine grievances and downplaying injustices, frequently by misrepresenting facts, and at the exact moments when Black and brown people are mobilizing against systemic racism and for crucial changes,” their letter stated.
The linguists demanded that the society revoke Pinker’s status as a “distinguished fellow” and strike his name from its list of media experts. The society’s executive committee declined to do so last week, stating, “It is not the mission of the society to control the opinions of its members, nor their expression.”
But a charge of racial insensitivity carries power in the current climate, and the letter sounded another shot in the fraught cultural battles now erupting in academia and publishing.
Also this month, 153 intellectuals and writers — many of them political liberals — signed a letter in Harper’s Magazine that criticized the current intellectual climate as “constricted” and “intolerant.” That led to a fiery response from opposing liberal and leftist writers, who accused the Harper’s letter writers of elitism and hypocrisy.
In an era of polarizing ideologies, Pinker, a linguist and social psychologist, is tough to pin down. He is a big supporter of Democrats and donated heavily to former President Barack Obama, but he has denounced what he sees as the closemindedness of heavily liberal U.S. universities. He likes to publicly entertain ideas outside the academic mainstream, including the question of innate differences between the sexes and among different ethnic and racial groups. And he has suggested that the political left’s insistence that certain subjects are off-limits contributed to the rise of the alt-right.
Reached at his home on Cape Cod, Pinker, 65, noted that as a tenured faculty member and established author, he could weather the campaign against him. But he said it could chill junior faculty who hold views counter to prevailing intellectual currents.
“I have a mindset that the world is a complex place we are trying to understand,” he said. “There is an inherent value to free speech because no one knows the solution to problems a priori.”
He described his critics as “speech police” who “have trolled through my writings to find offensive lines and adjectives.”
The letter against him focuses mainly on his activity on Twitter, where he has some 600,000 followers. It points to his 2015 tweet of an article from The Upshot, the data and analysis-focused team at The New York Times, which suggested that the high number of police shootings of Black people may not have been caused by racial bias of individual police officers but rather by the larger structural and economic realities that result in police having disproportionately high numbers of encounters with Black residents.
“Data: Police don’t shoot blacks disproportionately,” Pinker tweeted with a link to the article. “Problem: Not race, but too many police shootings.”
The linguists’ letter noted that the article made plain that police killings are a racial problem, and accused Pinker of making “dishonest claims in order to obfuscate the role of systemic racism in police violence.”
But the article also suggested that, because every encounter with police carries danger of escalation, any racial group interacting with police frequently risked becoming victims of police violence, due to poorly trained officers, armed suspects or overreaction. That appeared to be the point of Pinker’s tweet.
The linguists’ letter also accused the professor of engaging in racial dog whistles when he used the words “urban crime” and “urban violence” in other tweets.
But in those tweets, Pinker had linked to the work of scholars who are widely described as experts on urban crime and urban violence and its decline.
“‘Urban’ appears to be a usual terminological choice in work in sociology, political science, law and criminology,” wrote Jason Merchant, vice provost and a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago, who defended Pinker.
Another issue, Pinker’s critics say, is contained in his 2011 book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.” In a wide-ranging description of crime and urban decay and its effect on the culture of the 1970s and 1980s, he wrote that “Bernard Goetz, a mild-mannered engineer, became a folk hero for shooting four young muggers in a New York subway car.”
The linguists’ letter took strong issue with the words “mild-mannered,” noting that a neighbor later said that Goetz had spoken in racist terms of Latinos and Black people. He was not “mild-mannered” but rather intent on confrontation, they said.
The origin of the letter remains a mystery. Of 10 signers contacted by the Times, only one hinted that she knew the identity of the authors. Many of the linguists proved shy about talking, and since the letter first surfaced on Twitter on July 3, several prominent linguists have said their names had been included without their knowledge.
Several department chairs in linguistics and philosophy signed the letter, including professor Barry Smith of the University at Buffalo and professor Lisa Davidson of New York University. Smith did not return calls and an email, and Davidson declined to comment when The Times reached out.
The linguists’ letter touched only lightly on questions that have proved storm-tossed for Pinker in the past. In the debate over whether nature or nurture shapes human behavior, he has leaned toward nature, arguing that characteristics like psychological traits and intelligence are to some degree heritable.
He has also suggested that underrepresentation in the sciences could be rooted in part in biological differences between men and women. (He defended Lawrence Summers, the former Harvard president who in 2005 speculated that innate differences between the sexes might in part explain why fewer women succeed in science and math careers. Summers’ remark infuriated some female scientists and was among several controversies that led to his resignation the following year.)
And Pinker has made high-profile blunders, such as when he provided his expertise on language for the 2007 defense of financier Jeffrey Epstein on sex-trafficking charges. He has said he did so free of charge and at the request of a friend, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, and regrets it.
The clash may also reflect the fact that Pinker’s rosy outlook — he argues that the world is becoming a better place, by almost any measure, from poverty to literacy — sounds discordant during this painful moment of national reckoning with the still-ugly scars of racism and inequality.
The linguists’ society, like many academic and nonprofit organizations, recently released a wide-ranging statement calling for greater diversity in the field. It also urged linguists to confront how their research “might reproduce or work against racism.”
John McWhorter, a Columbia University professor of English and linguistics, cast the Pinker controversy within a moment when, he said, progressives look suspiciously at anyone who does not embrace the politics of racial and cultural identity.
“Steve is too big for this kerfuffle to affect him,” McWhorter said. “But it’s depressing that an erudite and reasonable scholar is seen by a lot of intelligent people as an undercover monster.”
Because this is a fight involving linguists, it features some expected elements: intense arguments about imprecise wording and sly intellectual put-downs. Pinker may have inflamed matters when he suggested in response to the letter that its signers lacked stature. “I recognize only one name among the signatories,” he tweeted. That, said Byron Ahn, a linguistics professor at Princeton, in a tweet of his own, amounted to “a kind of indirect ad hominem attack.”
The linguists insisted they were not attempting to censor Pinker. Rather, they were intent on showing that he had been deceitful and used racial dog whistles, and thus was a disreputable representative for linguistics.
“Any resulting action from this letter may make it clear to Black scholars that the LSA is sensitive to the impact that tweets of this sort have on maintaining structures that we should be attempting to dismantle,” wrote professor David Adger of Queen Mary University of London on his website.
That line of argument left McWhorter, a signer of the letter in Harper’s, exasperated.
“We’re in this moment that’s like a collective mic drop, and civility and common sense go out the window,” he said. “It’s enough to cry racism or sexism, and that’s that.”

More than 1,000 employees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have signed a letter calling for the agency to address “a pervasive and toxic culture of racial aggressions, bullying and marginalization” against Black employees.
The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, was first reported by National Public Radio on Monday. It was sent to Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the CDC, on June 30.
“After decades of well-meaning, yet underfunded, diversity and inclusion efforts, we have seen scant progress in addressing the very real challenges Black employees experience at CDC,” the letter said, pointing to a “lack of inclusion in the agency’s senior ranks” and “ongoing and recurring acts of racism and discrimination.”
The letter comes as the CDC is confronting the most urgent public health emergency in its 74-year history. The federal response to the coronavirus pandemic has been characterized as slow and ineffectual, and some have criticized the CDC for its failure to anticipate and explain the pandemic’s effect on Black and Latino people.
At the same time, widespread demonstrations for racial justice after the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and others at the hands of* police have prompted people and institutions across the country to acknowledge and confront enduring forms of racial discrimination.
The letter listed seven grievances and dozens of requests. It called for the agency to publicly acknowledge that systemic racism is a public health crisis, expand internship and fellowship opportunities to students at historically Black colleges and universities, and adopt mandatory implicit bias training.
“Dr. Redfield received the letter and responded,” a spokesman for the agency said in an email, without elaborating on the response. “CDC is committed to fostering a fair, equitable, and inclusive environment in which staff can openly share their concerns with agency leadership.”
Signatories of the June 30 letter, all of whom were employees of the CDC, could not be reached or declined to comment. Former staff members said that the current employees would not be allowed to speak to the news media without clearance.
“People are really nervous, which is why I am an intermediary,” said Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, an associate professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta and a former president of the American Public Health Association.
Jones worked at the CDC for 14 years before she left in 2014. She was a medical director whose work involved measuring and addressing the effect of racism on national health. The letter rang true for her, she said, adding that toward the end of her tenure at the agency, she felt that her work had been stifled.
She has been in touch with some of the letter’s signatories and said that most of the more than 1,000 people who have signed it did so after a smaller group of employees drafted the letter and sent it to Redfield.
“You have amazing people who are being stifled and thwarted,” Jones said. “If I were the director, I would receive that letter with immense appreciation and immediately try to start working on it.”
Gregorio Millett, an epidemiologist who left the CDC after 13 years to work for the Obama administration, said that he had good experiences with mentors at the agency. But he said it was common for African American employees there to feel constrained or ignored.
“I think the CDC should really take this issue far more seriously than it has in the past,” Millett said. “We need to go beyond listening sessions. It’s time for action. In fact, it’s long overdue.”
He added that Black leaders and scientists at the agency have done groundbreaking work in identifying and addressing the effects of social inequities and structural racism on health in the United States. “There needs to be more individuals of color involved in the leadership at CDC,” he said. “I’ve seen firsthand how that makes a difference.”
As of Tuesday morning, more than 3.3 million people in the United States had been infected with the coronavirus, and at least 135,400 had died, according to a Times database, and the number of new cases has surged in recent weeks. The pandemic has both highlighted and exacerbated racial inequities in the United States.
It has been clear for months that people of color have been disproportionately hurt by the virus. And last week, a set of new federal data — made available after The Times sued the CDC — revealed a more complete picture: From the beginning of the outbreak through at least May, Black and Latino people in the United States have suffered higher rates of infection and death across hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups.
“Racism is always important to address,” Jones said. “But it’s especially important to address if it’s impeding the nation’s response to a pandemic.”

NEW YORK — The cookout in Brooklyn on Sunday night was like many other outdoor parties in New York City during the pandemic. People gathered around a smoldering grill near a park late on a warm summer evening. The group included a 1-year-old boy in a stroller.
Then, at around 11:30 p.m., two gunmen dressed in black approached, fired a number of shots at the group and fled, police said.
The 1-year-old, Davell Gardner Jr., was hit in the stomach, officials said. He died a short time later at a nearby hospital, becoming one of the latest casualties in a summer of rising gun violence.
The death rattled a city that was already on edge because of a relentless surge in shootings, the pandemic and weeks of protests against police brutality.
“This is so painful,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news briefing Monday, before calling for a minute of silence. “It’s not something we can ever look away from.”
Three men were also wounded in the shooting, which happened near the Raymond Bush Playground in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, police said. The men — a 27-year-old who was hit in the ankle, a 36-year-old struck in the leg and a 35-year-old shot in the groin — were expected to survive.
“These are the very real people affected by senseless gun violence,” Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said on Twitter on Monday.
Two boys, 12 and 15, were among the city’s other victims of gun violence Sunday night. The 15-year-old was hit in the wrist on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard near 143rd Street in Harlem, police said. The 12-year-old was shot in the leg on Prospect Place near Ralph Avenue in the Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn.
On Monday afternoon, officers pored over the spot where Davell was hit. More than a dozen numbered orange evidence markers indicating where shell casings had been found dotted the roadway; several more traced a ragged path from the curb into, and through, the playground.
Davell’s death came during another grim weekend of gun violence in the city, where shootings in June and July are up sharply compared with the same period last year, a spike that has helped push the overall number for the year higher.
As of July 12, there had been 634 shootings in 2020, compared with 394 in 2019. At that pace, the city would top 800 shootings for the year. It would be the first time in three years that the city had reached that number.
Twenty-eight people died of gunshot wounds in June, police said. The trend continued into this month, with 20 more people fatally shot through July 12.
The spike in shootings has come as city residents and officials engage in a fierce debate over the future of policing, a discussion prompted by large-scale demonstrations over police brutality and institutional racism, including in the criminal justice system.
Since late May, protesters angered by the killing in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis and officer-involved shootings elsewhere have taken to city streets, calling for sweeping police reforms.
Last month, New York state banned chokeholds and repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret. City officials, responding to calls to defund the police, agreed in principle to shift roughly $1 billion from the New York City Police Department to other agencies.
Senior police officials and leaders of the city’s police unions argued against the moves, saying that they would hobble the department’s ability to deter violent crime, especially with shootings on the rise.
Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, who oversaw the Brooklyn North patrol borough before a recent promotion put him in charge of the Police Department’s Community Affairs bureau, appealed for an end to the violence in a Twitter message early Monday, saying, “This. Must. STOP!”
Experts on crime say that an increase in shootings, which other U.S. cities have experienced, is an annual summer occurrence that is more acute this year because of the strain the pandemic has put on the economy and on people’s living conditions.
But senior police officials, including Shea, have sought to link the uptick in shootings to recent changes in the criminal justice system, including court delays caused by the virus, a new bail law and other measures meant to reduce the jail population.
Crime data provided by police, however, has not shown a strong connection between the violence and those factors. Chief Michael LiPetri, the police chief in charge of crime statistics, said in an interview with The New York Daily News that just 7 out of 2,100 people released from jail with pending gun charges had been linked to shootings since their release.
Although killings and shootings have risen, reports of other four other major crimes — rape, robbery, felony assault and grand larceny — are either flat or down sharply so far this year. Burglaries and car thefts have surged during the pandemic, with thieves targeting empty restaurants and unattended vehicles.
Some elected officials and activists who support shrinking the Police Department and fundamentally changing its practices have repeatedly sought to counter the argument that efforts to reduce the jail population is behind the increase in shootings. They point to another possible factor: that most shootings still go unsolved by the police.
On Monday, de Blasio again said he believed that the rise in shootings was being fueled by the “horrible dislocation” caused by the pandemic, which ravaged the city’s economy and upended its courts and jails.
“The NYPD has been overloaded in so many ways and it just keeps adding up,” the mayor said. “And most importantly, the criminal justice system is not functioning yet.”
On Monday, at a news conference near where Davell was fatally shot, Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, said that officials should have been better prepared for the wave of gun violence.
“Everything in these communities has been made worse by the pandemic,” Williams said. “Everything. Why did you think gun violence would be different?”
The Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams, a former police captain, urged police to step up their investigations of recent shootings and to collaborate with neighborhood organizations to stem the violence.
“I want the same level of attention and dedication, because you are sworn to serve and protect this city,” Adams said, referring to the police. He added: “We want the apprehension of the person involved in taking the life of this 1-year-old child.”
As he spoke, Davell’s family gathered in front of an apartment building that faces the park. Several officers stood watch, while people spoke quietly and exchanged hugs. One young mother handed a candle and two balloons to an officer.
“Could you give this to the family?” she said.
De Blasio and Robert E. Cornegy Jr., the City Council member who represents the area, arrived later and spoke with Davell’s mother. Cornegy said the woman was still wearing the bloody clothes she had on as she carried her wounded son.
“There were just tears streaming down her face,” de Blasio said afterward. “I just told her that we’re here for her, and none of us can imagine what she’s going through.”

NYC’s Wave of Gun Violence Continues With 3 Drive-By Shootings [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — Five people were shot in Brooklyn on Monday in what the police described as three drive-by attacks within 20 minutes and about a mile of each other, continuing a wave of gun violence that has gripped New York this summer.
All the victims were the intended targets of the shootings, and all were expected to survive, said Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of detectives. The common element in the shootings, Harrison said, was a white, four-door sedan.
Although the shootings did not add to the city’s gun-related death toll for the year, they occurred after another weekend of violence that was capped Sunday night with the killing of a 1-year-old boy who was shot while he was at a cookout with his family at a Brooklyn playground.
Citing the boy’s death, Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, the recently installed leader of the Police Department’s Community Affairs Bureau, wrote on Twitter early Monday that “we as a community, we as a police department denounce this disgusting violence.”
“This. Must. STOP!” he added.
The number of shootings in the city is up sharply in June and July compared with the same period last year, and the spike has helped push up the overall number of shootings for the year.
As of July 12, there had been 634 shootings in 2020, compared with 394 in 2019. At that pace, the city was on track to top 800 shootings this year, which would be the first time that has happened in three years.
Twenty-eight people died of gunshot wounds in June, the police said; 20 more were fatally shot in July as of the 12th.
The increase of gunfire has coincided with a fierce debate over the future of policing, a discussion touched off by the large-scale protests over police brutality and institutional racism that followed the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
In New York, state lawmakers banned police chokeholds last month and repealed a law that had kept police disciplinary files secret. City officials agreed in principle to shift roughly $1 billion from the Police Department’s budget to other agencies.
Senior police officials and leaders of the city’s police unions have balked at the moves, saying they will hobble officers’ ability to deter violent crime, especially as shootings climb.
Police and union leaders have sought to link the uptick to, among other things, recent changes in the criminal justice system, including a new bail law, and to an effort to reduce the jail population amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Critics of the department, saying there is little evidence to support such claims, have pointed to another possible explanation for the continued wave of gun violence: that the police do not solve most shootings, leaving the assailants free to fire again.
The victims in the three drive-by shootings in Brooklyn ranged in age from 18-23, Harrison said.
At around 6:19 p.m., he said, a 23-year-old woman was shot four times in the chest on Remsen Avenue in the Canarsie section.
About 10 minutes later and about a mile way, on Rockaway Boulevard, three men, all 19, were each shot once, Harrison said: one in the elbow, one in the leg and one in the back.
Two minutes after that, he said, an 18-year-old male driver of a scooter at Flatlands Fourth Street and East 108th Street was shot once in the back. A woman who was riding with him was not hit by gunfire.
All the victims, none of whom the police identified, were taken to Brookdale Medical Center, Harrison said.
Several hours after the last shooting, on a block opposite the Fresh Creek Nature Preserve, a half-dozen residents stood near a length of police tape blocking traffic at East 108th Street and Flatlands Third Street.
One woman who declined to provide her name described the group as longtime “proud Canarsians” who felt safe in their surroundings. But she and several others who had gathered said there was a younger “gang” element that sometimes made its presence felt.
“A lot of those forces come from out of the neighborhood into the neighborhood,” Michael Stewart, 52, said.
“Seeing this,” he added, “this is a real aberration.”

Trump Continues Criticism of Movement to Defund the Police [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday assailed a broad movement to defund police departments, invoking the kind of pro-police language that won him support with the law enforcement community in 2016 and ignoring the calls for reform that have helped shape this election.
Democrats “want to defund, and they want to abolish,” Trump told a panel at the White House composed of people who have had positive interactions with the police. The president also said that Democrats were engaging in an “anti-cop crusade” while violent crime was rising in the cities they controlled.
With Trump facing an outcry over the threats he has made to protesters calling for racial equality and police reform efforts, his remarks Monday were part of an effort to embrace law enforcement — and to move away from more explicitly racist language — as polls show him lagging behind Joe Biden, his presumptive Democratic challenger.
That has meant targeting police reform efforts supported by Democrats, such as shifting funding from police departments to social services like mental health and substance abuse counseling. Trump has called the defunding efforts a fad, but last month, he issued an executive order outlining a series of overarching principles meant to encourage — but not mandate — departments to alter their behavior.
The president also painted a dark picture of the United States should Biden win.
“The radical politicians are waging war on innocent Americans,” Trump said. “If that’s what you want for a country, you probably have to vote for Sleepy Joe Biden because he doesn’t know what’s happening, but you are not going to have that with me.”
While recent polls have shown growing support among Republicans and Democrats for instituting police reform efforts — including banning chokeholds — after George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, was killed in police custody, most Americans reject the idea of defunding police departments.
Trump and his campaign have tried to accuse Biden of supporting efforts to defund the police, but Biden has actually opposed them. The former vice president’s spokesman has said he supported the need for an “urgent” overhaul after several police killings of Black men and women.
The president started on his theme on Twitter on Monday by declaring that the police “must take a stronger stand with the Radical Left politicians that are treating them so badly, and so disrespectfully.”
During the White House panel, Trump blamed Democrats for upticks in crime in major cities, including New York and Chicago. Then he again targeted protesters, criticizing them for painting a Black Lives Matter sign outside Trump Tower in New York, something that made him seethe when he first saw it on television.
“They ought to spend their time doing something else,” Trump said, adding, “Last month, over 300 people were shot.”
The president’s count was not accurate, but the 205 shootings in June in New York were the highest for that month since 1996, the police said. And New York surpassed 400 shootings in the first half of the year for the first time since 2016, with 528 by the end of last month.
Matthew J. Hickman, a criminal justice professor at Seattle University, said that Trump and his administration were leaning into a campaign tactic of supporting police officers and calling for law and order, strategies that have been around since the Nixon era.
But Hickman pointed out that the president’s efforts have been undercut by his threatening language, and that his requests for the police to toughen their responses to protesters have led to criticism from police chiefs in Chicago, Houston and elsewhere.
“Any police executive with a head on their shoulders rejects this idea that they somehow need to be tougher on protesters,” Hickman said, citing as an example Art Acevedo, Houston’s police chief, who last month publicly criticized Trump’s comments. “The ‘law and order’ thing is nothing new, but what is new in the Trump era is police chiefs pushing back on that.”
Trump was also asked by a reporter about how he could encourage Americans to support law enforcement when his decision to commute the sentence of his longtime friend and former campaign aide Roger Stone appeared to undermine his own Justice Department.
“Well,” Trump said, “if you look back on it, this was an investigation that should have never taken place.”

NEW YORK — He just won a landmark victory in the Supreme Court over President Donald Trump that paved the way for prosecutors to obtain the president’s tax returns. In February, he won a conviction against Harvey Weinstein in perhaps the biggest criminal case to arise from the #MeToo movement.
So why isn’t Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, a shoo-in for reelection?
Despite his recent successes, Vance remains politically vulnerable: He is facing a growing list of emboldened challengers, including two civil rights lawyers, an assemblyman, a former federal prosecutor, a career public defender and the former general counsel to the Brooklyn district attorney. Vance has raised only $29,000 for a reelection campaign, according to his disclosure forms.
And some feminists and advocates for sex abuse victims have criticized the handling of sex crime cases by Vance’s office.
Through it all, Vance has not even announced whether he will seek a fourth term next year.
Vance, 66, declined to be interviewed about his political plans. But he has maintained in recent days that he is focused on getting his office through the coronavirus pandemic, cutting down a backlog of cases that had built up in the months the courts slowed down, and — in response to the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis — addressing inequities within the criminal justice system.
“That’s where my attention is,” Vance told NY1 last week when asked if he intended to seek reelection.
Still, his effort to investigate Trump is likely to appeal to his base of Democratic supporters in Manhattan. When Vance tweeted Thursday that “no one — not even a president — is above the law,” it was liked more than 30,000 times.
“For New Yorkers, there is nothing bigger than the anti-Trump sentiment, and this case is just monumental when it comes to holding Trump accountable,” said George Arzt, a political consultant who advised Vance on his first campaign for district attorney, in 2010. “It takes a great deal of courage to go after the president.”
Six months ago, Vance was considered to be in deep political trouble, having been criticized for his handling of cases against the wealthy and well-connected, including the Trump family and Weinstein.
Vance’s office had been called into question over its decision to halt an investigation years ago into whether Trump and his children misled investors in a condominium project. And though Vance won the conviction against Weinstein — the Hollywood producer who is now in prison — he had declined to prosecute him five years earlier.
Now Vance is pursuing one of the biggest targets of his career: the president. The district attorney’s office sought eight years of business and personal tax records in connection with an investigation of the role that Trump and the Trump Organization played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election.
The office also focused on whether senior executives at the Trump Organization falsely accounted for the reimbursement as a legal expense to cover up the nature of the payment.
Once the office has access to Trump’s records, the investigation could broaden beyond the falsifying records law to include any potential financial or tax crimes.
In recent weeks, Vance has also taken on the New York Police Department after a series of videos showed officers assaulting peaceful protesters during demonstrations against police violence and racism in America.
He has dedicated significant resources to aggressively investigate allegations of police misconduct during the protests and has declined to prosecute demonstrators arrested on minor charges.
Last week, Vance announced that he intended to prosecute Amy Cooper, a white woman who called the police on a Black bird-watcher in Central Park when he asked her to put her dog on a leash. Cooper claimed that the man was threatening her, and the case resonated throughout the country, sparking a discussion about white people filing false police reports against Black people.
Vance said his office was “strongly committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable.” The pending criminal charge against Cooper appeared to be among the first that a white person in the country has faced for wrongfully calling the police to make a complaint about a Black person.
But some detractors have accused Vance of pandering to liberal voters in the wake of national protests against racism and police brutality.
“Is this just an exercise in trying to gain some kind of public credit?” said Mark Bederow, a criminal defense lawyer in New York and a former Manhattan prosecutor.
In recent years, Vance had lost the support of many feminists and advocates for sexual assault victims, who have faulted his office’s handling of sex crimes, including a 2015 case against Weinstein.
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, a Filipino Italian model, had accused the producer of groping her breasts and shoving his hand up her skirt. With the help of the police, she recorded Weinstein apologizing for touching her. Vance declined to take the case.
The prosecutor also faced harsh criticism for the way his office agreed to a no-jail plea deal for Robert A. Hadden, a prominent gynecologist who had abused his patients. Elected officials and women’s rights advocates staged protests during Weinstein’s trial, pointing to the Hadden case as an example of another failed prosecution.
“I think that people and women in particular are asking for more vigorous prosecution and that the harm of this kind of violence be taken seriously for the public safety problem that it is,” said Tali Farhadian Weinstein, the former general counsel to the Brooklyn district attorney who has announced a run for Manhattan district attorney. “People have been demanding accountability.”
Another challenger, Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor, said that on Vance’s watch, “people with access and privilege in this town were able to evade accountability.”
But he faulted Vance for taking a hard line on some minor cases in which he might have shown leniency. Bragg noted a case in 2018 of a homeless woman who was prosecuted for selling a loose cigarette. Prosecuting those cases, he said, “do not make us safer.”
Vance’s defenders say he has embraced the goals — popular among progressives — of cutting back on the aggressive enforcement of low-level crimes, which has been shown to have unfair impact on Black and Hispanic residents.
He has stopped prosecuting certain low-level offenses, including possession of and smoking marijuana, subway fare evasion and unlicensed vending. He has said that prosecutions in Manhattan have dropped by 58% over the past decade.
His supporters have said that Vance has pursued risky cases. They point to Weinstein’s recent case, which raised questions about the issue of consent, and the 2011 case of two officers who were acquitted on charges that they raped a drunken woman after helping her into her apartment while on patrol.
“If you take hard cases, you’re going to lose a few,” said Erin Kramer, Vance’s former senior adviser. “You don’t want someone who shies away from taking the hard cases because they are afraid of losing.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — The cookout in Brooklyn on Sunday night was like many other outdoor parties in New York City during the pandemic. People gathered around a smoldering grill near a park late on a warm summer evening. The group included a 1-year-old boy in a stroller.
Then, at around 11:30 p.m., two gunmen dressed in black approached, fired a number of shots at the group and fled, police said.
The 1-year-old, Davell Gardner Jr., was hit in the stomach, officials said. He died a short time later at a nearby hospital, becoming one of the latest casualties in a summer of rising gun violence.
The death rattled a city that was already on edge because of a relentless surge in shootings, the pandemic and weeks of protests against police brutality.
“This is so painful,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news briefing Monday, before calling for a minute of silence. “It’s not something we can ever look away from.”
Three men were also wounded in the shooting, which happened near the Raymond Bush Playground in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, police said. The men — a 27-year-old who was hit in the ankle, a 36-year-old struck in the leg and a 35-year-old shot in the groin — were expected to survive.
“These are the very real people affected by senseless gun violence,” Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said on Twitter Monday.
Two boys, 12 and 15, were among the city’s other victims of gun violence Sunday night. The 15-year-old was hit in the wrist on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd. near 143rd Street in Harlem, police said. The 12-year-old was shot in the leg on Prospect Place near Ralph Avenue in the Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn.
On Monday afternoon, officers pored over the spot where Davell was hit. More than a dozen numbered orange evidence markers indicating where shell casings had been found dotted the roadway; several more traced a ragged path from the curb into, and through, the playground.
Davell’s death came during another grim weekend of gun violence in the city, where shootings in June and July are up sharply compared with the same period last year, a spike that has helped push the overall number for the year higher.
As of July 12, there had been 634 shootings in 2020, compared with 394 in 2019. At that pace, the city would top 800 shootings for the year. It would be the first time in three years that the city had reached that number.
Twenty-eight people died of gunshot wounds in June, police said. The trend continued into this month, with 20 more people fatally shot through July 12.
The spike in shootings has come as city residents and officials engage in a fierce debate over the future of policing, a discussion prompted by large-scale demonstrations over police brutality and institutional racism, including in the criminal justice system.
Since late May, protesters angered by the killing in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis and officer-involved shootings elsewhere have taken to city streets, calling for sweeping police reforms.
Last month, New York state banned chokeholds and repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret. City officials, responding to calls to defund the police, agreed in principle to shift roughly $1 billion from the Police Department to other agencies.
Senior police officials and leaders of the city’s police unions argued against the moves, saying that they would hobble the department’s ability to deter violent crime, especially with shootings on the rise.
Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, who oversaw the Brooklyn North patrol borough before a recent promotion put him in charge of the Police Department’s Community Affairs Bureau, appealed for an end to the violence in a Twitter message early Monday, saying, “This. Must. STOP!”
Experts on crime say that an increase in shootings, which other U.S. cities have experienced, is an annual summer occurrence that is more acute this year because of the strain the pandemic has put on the economy and on people’s living conditions.
But senior police officials, including Shea, have sought to link the uptick in shootings to recent changes in the criminal justice system, including court delays caused by the virus, a new bail law and other measures meant to reduce the jail population.
Crime data provided by police, however, has not shown a strong connection between the violence and those factors. Chief Michael LiPetri, the police chief in charge of crime statistics, said in an interview with The New York Daily News that just 7 out of 2,100 people released from jail with pending gun charges had been linked to shootings since their release.
Although murders and shootings have risen, reports of four other major crimes — rape, robbery, felony assault and grand larceny — are either flat or down sharply so far this year. Burglaries and car thefts have surged during the pandemic, with thieves targeting empty restaurants and unattended vehicles.
Some elected officials and activists who support shrinking the Police Department and fundamentally changing its practices have repeatedly sought to counter the argument that efforts to reduce the jail population is behind the increase in shootings. They point to another possible factor: that most shootings still go unsolved by the police.
On Monday, de Blasio again said he believed that the rise in shootings was being fueled by the “horrible dislocation” caused by the pandemic, which ravaged the city’s economy and upended its courts and jails.
“The NYPD has been overloaded in so many ways and it just keeps adding up,” the mayor said. “And most importantly, the criminal justice system is not functioning yet.”
On Monday, at a news conference near where Davell was fatally shot, Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, said that officials should have been better prepared for the wave of gun violence.
“Everything in these communities has been made worse by the pandemic,” Williams said. “Everything. Why did you think gun violence would be different?”
The Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams, a former police captain, urged police to step up their investigations of recent shootings and to collaborate with neighborhood organizations to stem the violence.
“I want the same level of attention and dedication, because you are sworn to serve and protect this city,” Adams said, referring to the police. He added: “We want the apprehension of the person involved in taking the life of this 1-year-old child.”
As he spoke, Davell’s family gathered in front of an apartment building that faces the park. Several officers stood watch, while people spoke quietly and exchanged hugs. One young mother handed a candle and two balloons to an officer.
“Could you give this to the family?” she said.
De Blasio and Robert E. Cornegy Jr., the City Council member who represents the area, arrived later and spoke with Davell’s mother. Cornegy said the woman was still wearing the bloody clothes she had on as she carried her wounded son.
“There were just tears streaming down her face,” de Blasio said afterward. “I just told her that we’re here for her, and none of us can imagine what she’s going through.”

She Found Her Voice in a WNBA Locker Room, Then Used It in Sweden [With graphic(s)]

Four years ago, the New York Liberty became one of the first professional sports franchises to make a unified on-court statement against police brutality and racial injustice. Even before Colin Kaepernick drew widespread attention for kneeling during the NFL preseason later that summer, the Liberty took the court for a game wearing black shirts that said #BlackLivesMatter.
That summer had a profound impact on Liberty center Amanda Zahui B., who had arrived in the United States just three years earlier, to attend the University of Minnesota.
In a locker room led by Tina Charles, Swin Cash, Tanisha Wright and Carolyn Swords, Zahui B. absorbed herself in discussions with nuanced views of race, mental health and womanhood.
Those conversations came rushing back to mind recently for Zahui B., the daughter of a French-Spanish mother and father from the Ivory Coast, after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.
She had been quarantining in her hometown, Stockholm, when she learned about Floyd’s death. Initially, she felt beckoned to the marches in Minneapolis and the ones outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the Liberty’s future home arena.
She then recalled something her former Liberty teammates had emphasized to international players years ago: the importance of pushing for change abroad, not only in the United States.
And so, before she returned to Brooklyn to prepare for the start of the WNBA season at the end of this month, Zahui B. focused her efforts on issues in Sweden, promoting protests and boycotts to drive Swedes to confront what she described as an unspoken history of racial inequality.
“We don’t talk about race here,” Zahui B., 26, said last month from her apartment in Dalen, located in the Southside of Stockholm. “Minneapolis, I wanted to march the streets with everyone. I wanted to do whatever I can do for that community. But at the same time, we have so much work to do in Sweden. You have to start at home.”
Zahui B. grew up in neighborhoods heavily populated by African immigrants who, like her father, Alex Zahui Bazoukou, toiled to find work in Stockholm. Last year, the Swedish government reported 231,276 African Swedes living in the country.
Zahui B.’s mother, Ann-Sofi, who was born in Sweden and settled in Stockholm after a nomadic childhood, helped start Sara Bokhandel, which claims to be the first Kurdish bookstore in Europe. Zahui B. recalled rifling through children’s books translated into Arabic, like the Swedish classic “Pippi Longstocking.”
But as she grew up, Zahui B. found that the diverse environments she was raised in were largely ignored in much of Sweden.
As an example, she pointed to media representations. There is the popular show “Svenska Hollywoodfruar” (“Swedish Hollywood Wives”), which features a cast of blond-haired and blue-eyed women. And in televised games of the Swedish women’s national team, Zahui B. said, broadcasters flock to her over teammates with darker complexions.
“We don’t really promote people of color out here, and if we do, we are very light,” Zahui B. said.
Sofia Ulver, a marketing professor at Lund University in Sweden, agreed that race was seldom talked about in Sweden. She helped write a study submitted for peer review this month that examined racial and ethnic representation in Swedish television commercials.
Ulver noted a history of legislative efforts in Sweden that have sought to negate race as a concrete source of bias to be considered in lawmaking — an approach that some critics argue ignores the existence of actual racism.
“We have huge integration problems in Sweden,” said Ulver, who added that before World War II, Sweden openly promoted the concept of genetic superiority among certain races. “We have not been good at integrating new multicultural groups that are coming in. It’s hugely segregated.”
Zahui B. said her family always encouraged open dialogue, but it was not until a May 2016 trade to the Liberty that she became comfortable with expressing vulnerability.
Zahui B., who said she had wrestled as a child with the concept of “being Black in Europe and being viewed as a white person when I’m in the Ivory Coast,” said Charles challenged her to think deeply about what it means to be a Black woman in the modern world.
“You see now people coming from a point of separation to: How do we come together for one thing to affect change?” said Wright, who is now an assistant coach with the Las Vegas Aces. “During that season, we were already there. We were a microcosm of what we happen to see now.”
Eventually, Zahui B. felt comfortable enough to drive conversations about what actions the team should take throughout the 2016 season. That summer, the Liberty wore black warm-up shirts with messages supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and staged a media blackout, and at least one player sat during the national anthem. Cash began asking Zahui B. about race in Sweden, which led to discussions about the similar issues in the two countries.
“She started to unlay herself and became outspoken, someone who wanted to impact and leave a lasting impression on you,” said Charles, who is now with the Washington Mystics.
For Zahui B., those conversations allowed her to elucidate emotions that had previously felt muted and muddled — feelings that stemmed from being followed around stores and banks in Stockholm, her instinct to drive with two hands on the steering wheel and with her driver’s license out next to her in case she was pulled over.
“Sometimes I have a wall up because I know how the world is,” Zahui B. said. “I speak up, and I’m going to get something back. But learning how to really show that I’m actually human — like, I cry myself to sleep, I have nightmares, we all go through depression and we are all scared and upset — that’s kind of like the growth I’ve had, especially since coming to the Liberty.”
Last month, Zahui B. discussed the idea of organizing a Black Lives Matter protest in Stockholm with her agent and local activists before joining one already planned for June 3. Zahui B. publicized the march on Instagram, where she estimates a majority of her 15,000-plus followers are Swedish.
Emboldened by the thousands of Swedes who marched, Zahui B. contacted all the major news stations in Sweden, offering to discuss race on live air. In response, some radio stations proposed interviews about basketball instead.
“I said no,” Zahui B. said. “I want to talk about what really matters.” She added that she has refrained from giving interviews with certain Swedish stations until they made a concerted effort to address race in their coverage.
As an alternative, Zahui B. has begun posting unfiltered Instagram videos about race to her largely Swedish audience.
Zahui B. said it did not bother her if such conversations were uncomfortable for viewers, as she considers them necessary for progress. After the June 3 protest, for example, her neighbor greeted her in the hallway of her building and asked how she was doing.
She responded that she was tired of seeing Black people unjustifiably killed, and said that if he did not want to have a conversation about that, then he did not have to speak to her ever again.
“I’m being kind of direct and planting a seed in people’s heads,” Zahui B. said. “I do not need you to tell me you’re sorry or that you understand how I feel. I need you to actually make a change and go home and have a conversation with your family, with your kids.
“When you go to work and hear somebody say something that is inappropriate, speak up. Speak up even if it’s uncomfortable. Do it.”

PARIS — Mohamed Amghar was a 40-year-old software salesman in the final stages of interviewing for a new job in November 1996 when, in his telling, his future boss made a request that left him speechless.
You’ll have to change your name to “Antoine,” the man said, even specifying, according to Amghar, not to use “Philippe” because there were already two in the office.
Amghar felt he had no choice. Still, he was ashamed — and angry.
“It’s a betrayal,” said Amghar, born in Paris to Algerian parents who arrived there in 1946, when Algeria was still part of France. “You are made to understand, at 40 years old, that ‘No, Mohamed, you aren’t truly French like everyone else.’”
And so, Mohamed became Antoine — on his email address, on his business card, on train and plane tickets, on name tags used at industry conferences, even on performance awards he collected over two decades at the company, Intergraph, an American software firm with French offices in Rungis, south of Paris.
Amghar, now 63 and retired, sued the company last year in a labor court in Créteil, south of Paris, accusing it of discrimination and moral harassment and asking for more than 440,000 euros, or nearly $500,000, in damages. The court held a hearing in March but won’t rule until next year.
The case has stood out because few racial discrimination suits reach French courts. And it resonates powerfully as France reckons with its colonial past, racism in the police and attitudes toward racial discrimination more generally in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis.
Jacques Toubon, France’s human rights ombudsman, noted this month in a landmark report that studies and official statistics were unequivocal on the extent and “systemic nature” of discrimination in France.
“People of a foreign origin or who are perceived as such are more exposed to unemployment, social insecurity, bad housing conditions and poorer health,” he wrote.
At the time Amghar says his boss requested that he use a different name, he had been assured of the position but had not yet signed a contract, and he had already quit his old job. He was divorced with three children — the oldest was 13 at the time.
“And I was not stupid,” Amghar said in an interview at his lawyer’s office in Paris. “I knew that being called Mohamed wasn’t the best passport, not only to get interviews but also a job.”
Amghar says that, relatively speaking, he was fortunate even to get the job given France’s record of discrimination. The sales manager position involved selling engineering software to energy or chemical companies like Total or Arkema and was well paid.
He also acknowledges that he never filed an official complaint over his time at Intergraph, from 1997 to 2017.
“I thought to myself: ‘You didn’t say anything in the beginning, what are you going to say now?’” he said.
Intergraph, based in Alabama and bought in 2010 by Hexagon AB, a Swedish firm, did not deny that Amghar used a different name at the office, but said it had found no proof that management had requested the change.
Hexagon’s PPM division, which includes Intergraph, said in an email that after receiving Amghar’s complaint in 2018, it had conducted an “internal investigation” that involved reviewing documents and speaking with current or former employees.
But the company said it had “found no evidence of discrimination or that Intergraph France management required Mr. Amghar to change his name, or otherwise required Mr. Amghar to use the name of ‘Antoine’ when representing the company.”
“Intergraph has always adhered to a strict standard of ethics and professional conduct in order to prevent all types of discrimination, racism and harassment, which are subjects it takes very seriously,” the company said.
Hiring discrimination against Arab or Black minorities in France is widely documented. One recent study where fake applications were submitted to more than 100 blue-chip companies found that candidates with Arab-sounding names were nearly 20% less likely to get an answer than those with traditional French ones.
“In all the studies that have been done in France, you find significant discriminations based on origin, whether Arab or Black,” said Yannick L’Horty, an economist who led the study with a team of researchers who specialize in assessing labor discriminations and the impact of public policies in the job market.
Amghar’s case is unusual because he was, in fact, hired — which Intergraph is eager to point out.
A lawyer representing the company in France declined to comment. But in 2018, responding to a letter from Amghar’s lawyer that threatened to file a suit barring “amicable reparation,” the firm called the accusations of discrimination “surprising” because Amghar had been “recruited by Intergraph and stayed there for 20 years.”
In the letter, a copy of which was seen by The New York Times, the company said that Amghar’s former boss — who no longer works at Intergraph — did not remember asking him to change names, adding that “one cannot exclude the possibility” that Amghar himself had chosen “Antoine.”
Amghar, who is meticulously organized, has kept business cards, pay stubs, emails, contracts, security clearance documents, awards, and more, all featuring the name “Antoine.”
And while there is no record of the November 1996 interview, Amghar bristles at the suggestion that he would have intentionally put himself in the awkward position of using two different names.
He was once stopped at an airport because his passport didn’t match tickets booked by the company. In meetings or emails, senior managers sometimes used Antoine while colleagues used Mohamed. On pay slips, he was “Mohamed Antoine.” One award from 2010 even used “Antoine (Mohamed) Amghar.”
Amghar’s closest colleagues quickly learned the truth. But others said they were stunned to discover, months or even years after first meeting him, that Antoine was, in fact, Mohamed.
Raoul Tardy, a retiree who worked for Intergraph in Norway from 1991 to 2015, said that Amghar was introduced to him as Antoine. For several years, that was the name he used on the phone or at meetings.
“In the phone directory, it was Antoine. On the business card, it was Antoine. On the organizational chart, it was Antoine. It was Antoine everywhere,” Tardy said.
Then, in the early 2000s on a bus ride during a company gathering in Austria, he overheard colleagues call Amghar “Momo,” a nickname for Mohamed. Amghar told him the truth.
“I didn’t fall from my seat, but almost,” said Tardy, one of several former Intergraph employees who submitted written testimonies supporting Amghar in his suit. “What really shocked me is that none of the French managers tried to fix the problem.”
Amghar is cheerful and quick to joke, but some of his sarcasm hints at deep resentment. For his managers, a man of Arab origin in his position was “inconceivable,” he said.
“Mohamed can’t sign a 12 million euro contract and chat with the CEO of a company,” Amghar said in mock outrage. “It’s not possible!”
Frédéric Blas, a former colleague who was an in-house lawyer at Intergraph France from 2011 to 2016, said Amghar “felt humiliated. There was a real bitterness, a frustration.”
There were no explicit instructions from senior managers to use the name Antoine, Blas said, but that was the name heard and used by those who didn’t work very closely with Amghar. It was “unsettling,” Blas added, and sometimes difficult for him not to use Antoine by force of habit.
Galina Elbaz, Amghar’s lawyer, who also works for the International League Against Racism and anti-Semitism — a French civil rights group that has taken interest in his case — said that criminal discrimination cases are rarely prosecuted.
“It’s five to six cases a year, barely,” Elbaz said, adding that often the victims are poor, working, and reluctant to spend months or years, and thousands of euros in lawyer fees, on an uncertain outcome.
Toubon, the human rights ombudsman, noted in his report that among those who had reported personal cases of job discrimination to his office, only 12% had taken legal action.
Victims do not always have hard proof of the mistreatment, the report noted, and many of them are reluctant to disrupt their professional lives by taking their employer to court.
In labor courts — like the one handling Amghar’s case — there are precedents in his favor. But cases often drag on, Elbaz said, as the judges are not professional magistrates and aren’t always well versed in anti-discrimination law.
Still, Amghar said it was important for him to file the suit. He recalled his father’s account of racism suffered in Algeria and then in France as a carpentry worker, and he remembered his parents’ faith that French meritocracy would give their children a different experience.
“If people like me, who did what was necessary to get good jobs, to get training, to live as citizens, are besmirched and denied our rights, where are we going?” Amghar said animatedly.
“I only have one name, I only have one nationality,” he added. “My name is Mohamed, and I am French.”

When Dharyl Auguste was 3 years old, he and his parents packed all of their belongings and left their home in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to immigrate to the United States.
The family settled initially in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, before moving to nearby Sunrise. When it was time for Auguste to attend middle school, he and his parents relocated again, this time to Plantation, Florida. Auguste welcomed the move, he said, because it was easier for him to see his friends and access public transportation.
But something was not right in Plantation.
“It often came up as a topic between me and friends, and we all had the same feeling that it’s not a welcoming name,” Auguste, 27, said.
In the weeks since the George Floyd protests began, neighborhoods and subdivisions across the country have removed the word “plantation” from their names. In June, Rhode Island — known formally as the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations — announced that it would drop the second half of its official name from state documents and websites. (State lawmakers have introduced legislation that would put a name-change referendum on the ballot in November.)
Inspired by the social unrest spurred by the death of Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him to the ground by the neck for more than eight minutes, Auguste started a petition to change the name of Plantation.
“I was at home sitting in awe as our nation was going through a social awakening,” he said in an interview this past week. According to Auguste, images of toppled monuments to slaveholders and Confederate generals fueled him to take action. The petition he created June 7 has been signed more than 11,000 times.
Strictly speaking, the word “plantation” refers to a large group of plants or trees in a settlement. But the association with slavery is inescapable.
“We can’t ignore the image conjured by the word ‘plantation,’” Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island said last month. “We can’t ignore how painful that is for Black Rhode Islanders to see that and have to see that as part of their state’s name. It’s demoralizing. It’s a slap in the face. It’s painful.”
Gabriela Koster, who moved to Plantation, Florida, in 2006, agrees.
“I have been saying for 15 years that I do not think it’s an appropriate name for our city,” Koster said. “I don’t think it serves us well.”
Koster, 42, who raised her three children in Plantation, described the city as vibrant but said its name dulled some of the city’s luster.
But Lynn Stoner, the mayor of Plantation, does not necessarily share this opinion.
“If we change the name, it doesn’t change the mindset of what people indicate the problem is,” Stoner said. “I think it is just the optics.”
Stoner has lived in Plantation for 50 years, and she proposed instead that residents be educated on the “racial components and diversity in the community.”
“I’m more about the education piece,” Stoner said at a City Council meeting July 1, during which she also suggested that residents be taught about what should be considered offensive and why. “I feel like changing the name doesn’t change the philosophies — I think that’s where the bigger issue is.”
At the meeting, Stoner criticized an interview that Auguste had recently given on CNN, saying that “he didn’t do real well.” (She later apologized.) She also asked Auguste during the meeting whether she should use the term “African Americans” or “Blacks”; claimed that the first time she “ever really saw” Black people was when she moved to Plantation; and said that the last three people she had hired were not white.
She added that she was taught to treat everyone equally.
In response to Stoner’s comments, Auguste told the mayor that just because the city’s name represented the status quo it did not mean it should stay that way.
“I’m sure that was the same mentality when slavery was ended,” Auguste said. “We have to be more than not racist — we have to be anti-racist.”
Because the city of Plantation wasn’t incorporated until 1953, many — including Stoner — believe that its name is exempt from the correlation with slavery.
“This isn’t just about Black people,” the mayor said in an interview Tuesday. “It is about how Black people and people from other countries all relate to each other.”
Across the country, people are working to change the names of neighborhoods, developments and subdivisions that include the word “plantation.” In Hilton Head, South Carolina, efforts to change the names of gated communities and resorts are unequivocally about Black people. Beaufort County, which includes the island of Hilton Head, was founded in 1711. Before the Civil War, there were more than 20 plantations on the island where slave labor produced cotton, indigo, sugar cane, rice and other crops, according to the local government.
Today, Hilton Head is a resort town with developments and gated communities whose names often have the word “plantation” in them.
“It has been co-opted to mean a gated community in the area,” said Marisa Wojcikiewicz, who started a petition last month to change the names of the resorts and gated communities. “It is very strange, to say the least, considering that the island is inextricably linked to the plantation economy.”
According to Wojcikiewicz, whose petition has over 8,000 signatures, a manager of the Hilton Head Plantation development had not entirely shot down the idea of changing the name of the development. Wojcikiewicz said she was surprised to find that some residents of the developments, who are mostly white, older and affluent, supported changing the name.
Peter Kristian, general manager of the Hilton Head Plantation property owners association, did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.
In Plantation, Florida, Auguste has two options to get the city to change its name. The City Council can vote to have a referendum added to the November ballot for the name change or Auguste can go door to door to collect signatures from at least 10% of the city’s 94,000 residents, which would compel a City Council review. In Hilton Head, because the developments and resorts are privately owned, the onus is on the owners and investors to make any name changes.
Most people don’t want to be told that something they are doing is wrong, according to Wojcikiewicz, particularly when they have never given any thought to how it might be hurtful.
“Many people are afraid to admit that they were blind to the fact that it is racist,” she said. “They think a plantation is this beautiful, expansive, green, calm, Southern idyllic life that everyone wishes they could have. We have deluded ourselves.”

The Demand Snyder Couldn't Afford to Dismiss: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Long a defiant defender of his team's name, the owner of the Washington football team changed course in short order after FedEx sent a letter threatening to withdraw its sponsorship.
After decades of controversy, it took a serious threat to Dan Snyder's team's finances, and those of the rest of the N.F.L., to get the owner of the Washington Redskins to consider changing the team's name, which Native Americans (and many dictionaries) consider to be a slur.
The final straw? FedEx, which pays about $ 8 million a year for the naming rights to the team's stadium in Landover, Md., and whose chairman has been trying to sell his shares in the team, said that it would back out of the deal if the name was not changed in a letter that The New York Times was allowed to review.
On July 2, the legal counsel for FedEx sent a letter to his counterpart with the team saying the company would demand its name be removed from the stadium, where it has been displayed since 1999, if the team name was not changed.
"We are hopeful that a name change and a new head coach will help move public perception in a positive direction, restore the team's reputation and lessen our deep concerns," the letter said.
A day later, Snyder said that the team "will undergo a thorough review" of its name, bending to a company that committed to paying more than $ 200 million for its affiliation with the team.
FedEx's push "was really a turning point," said an N.F.L. owner who requested anonymity to speak publicly about another owner. "At this point in time, you can't be insensitive because it affects all of us."
The majority of, though not all, the N.F.L.'s owners now agree that the name should be changed, the person said, and Snyder has "reached the point where he's moved on."
It is unclear how long the team will take to review an issue it has known about for decades. Changing team names, logos and colors -- a process that requires navigating trademarks and the league's many licensing deals with partners -- can often take years. The team declined to make Snyder or any team officials available for this article, saying it would address any questions after the review is complete. The N.F.L. also did not respond to a request for comment.
But Snyder's shift from total resistance to grudging recognition in a matter of weeks has been remarkably swift in a league that often moves deliberately, if at all.
'We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER.'
For years, Snyder faced little financial pressure to change his team's name because sponsors were all but silent on the issue. N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, who has said he grew up rooting for the team, in the past publicly stood by Snyder's argument that the club's name and logos are meant to honor the team's heritage and Native Americans.
Activists have opposed the name for decades, filing lawsuits that Snyder fought vociferously. Politicians have called him out and friends have privately appealed to his sense of decency, all to no avail.
Still, Goodell had tried to prevent the controversy from bubbling into a full-blown crisis. In 2013, when Snyder inflamed the debate by emphatically telling a reporter, "We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER -- you can use caps," the commissioner hosted a meeting at the league's headquarters in New York to clear the air.
According to two people who attended the meeting, Snyder brought with him Bruce Allen, then the team's president; a strategist; investors in the team; and Lanny Davis, a lawyer who represented Snyder. Goodell was joined by several deputies, including Adolpho Birch, then a senior vice president.
Snyder's group presented surveys that showed that the team's fans supported the name, and several other justifications for sticking with it. Goodell questioned Snyder without pushing a viewpoint, one person said. Near the end of the meeting, Charlie Black, a political consultant hired by the team, told Goodell that if he convinced the N.F.L.'s other owners to endorse the name, the problem would go away.
Goodell pointedly explained that he did not speak for the league's owners and that Snyder needed to communicate with them directly if he wanted their support. The meeting ended as it started, with Snyder still in control of the destiny of the team's name.
Several departments at the headquarters, though, were quietly doing trademark searches and taking other steps to prepare for the day when the team might be renamed.
'All of a sudden, after this letter, they're saying, "Change the name."'
The hands-off approach crumbled quickly amid the protests that followed George Floyd's death in police custody this May. Goodell apologized last month for not listening to the concerns of African-American players years before, in response to some of the league's biggest stars calling on him to address systemic racism.
Faced with growing public demands, companies across the country have issued statements expressing their commitment to undo racist policies, promote diversity in their hiring and fight injustice in their communities. In late June, FedEx, Nike and Pepsi received letters from dozens of investment funds that hold shares in those companies, urging them to distance themselves from the Washington team.
"It was clear to us that those racial justice statements implicated their relationship with the Washington football team," said Carla Fredericks, the director of First Peoples Worldwide, who led the letter-writing campaign.
Still, FedEx joining the fight against the team name came as a surprise to those who have led it. Suzan Shown Harjo, who for decades has pushed high school, college and professional teams to abandon names and logos with Native American imagery, said she and other activists have pressured FedEx and other team sponsors in the past, with little success.
On June 26, dozens of activists and investment groups sent FedEx's chairman, Frederick Smith, a letter urging the company to terminate its relationship with the team because its name "remains a dehumanizing word characterizing people by skin color and a racial slur with hateful connotations."
Smith is part of a trio of investors who hold about 40 percent of the team's shares. He and the other limited partners, Dwight Schar, the chairman of a major homebuilder, and Robert Rothman, the chairman of a private equity firm, have tried to sell their shares for many months.
FedEx declined to make Smith available for comment, and efforts to reach Schar and Rothman were unsuccessful. John Moag, who reportedly represents them in the sale, said he does not "talk on or off the record during a transaction."
After years of standing by the team, the companies finally bent.
"All of a sudden, after this letter, they're saying, 'Change the name,' and what's the difference -- George Floyd was murdered before the world and corporate America woke up," Harjo said.
Harjo said she was hopeful that the pressure from the team's corporate sponsors would result in a new name but was skeptical that Snyder was only trying to buy time and once again let the controversy pass.
"What they've done is try to take control of the issue, and that's what they've done all along, and that's what they mean by process and review," she said.
Lost trust and a business imperative
Changing the team name would ease tensions between Snyder and lawmakers in Washington, many of whom oppose his goal of building a new stadium in the district. Snyder keeps a close circle of friends that includes the team's investors, and he bristles at any suggestion that he change the team name, according to several people who have worked with him. Over the years, Snyder has pulled back from speaking publicly, convinced that there is no upside to trying to improve his image.
"His bad media, which has been terrible, bordering on horrible, is a result of a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy: They hate me, therefore I hate them and I won't talk to them," said Davis, the Washington lawyer who said he encouraged Snyder to get his side of the story out. "It's circular."
The team's lack of competitive success has not helped. They have made the postseason only five times since Snyder bought the team in 1999, and off-the-field controversies have made things worse.
Snyder has sued an impoverished longtime season-ticket holder and a reporter who published an article he didn't like, charged fans to watch training camp and cut down trees on federally protected land to improve the view from his house. Many of the team's cheerleaders have described an uncomfortable work environment, including a photo shoot in which cheerleaders were topless at an event for sponsors and ticket holders.
Then there is the name, which even some die-hard fans reject. Eddie Huang, the celebrity chef and author of the memoir, "Fresh Off the Boat," grew up in suburban Washington in the 1980s idolizing the team. But as a teenager, he said, he began to question why white fans dressed up as Native Americans.
"It got to a point where I was old enough to recognize that if someone had done this with a name about Asians or Blacks or Mexicans, it wouldn't be accepted," said Huang, who stopped wearing the team's jersey several years ago. "If you called a team the 'yellow skins' or 'Black skins,' it would be lights out."
Attendance has suffered. The team drew an average of 65,500 fans last year, less than 80 percent of the capacity at FedEx Field, one of the lowest percentages in the league. Over the last few years, the team has ripped about 10,000 seats out of the stadium.
Within and outside of the N.F.L., observers note that Snyder could benefit from changing the team's name. Longtime fans would scoop up old merchandise and buy new jerseys and caps when the makeover was complete.
A new name would also help pave the way for the team to build a stadium in the district. Snyder's favored location is the site of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, referred to locally as R.F.K., where the team played for 35 years, until 1996. The land is owned by the National Park Service, which has leased it through 2038 to Events DC, a quasi-public organization that manages several Washington sports sites.
Muriel Bowser, the city's mayor, has said in the past that the team should not be allowed to build inside the district without changing the name, but allowed this week that the name was not the only issue in deciding whether to grant the team access.
Snyder has over two decades lost trust with fans, politicians and Native American groups, but in a moment of societal change, he finally faces a business imperative to alter the team's future.
Fredericks, who led the group challenging sponsors, said that only a complete name and mascot change was acceptable. "The investors are very clear that a half measure is not going to put these issues to bed," she said.

The office of freeholder is unique to New Jersey, a title for politicians elected to one of the state’s 21 county legislative boards.
It dates back to New Jersey’s original Constitution of 1776, meaning those who had some form of an estate and at least “50 pounds of proclamation money.”
It also harkens back to a time when only white, male landowners could hold public office.
On Thursday, in the midst of a national reckoning over racial injustice and symbols of hate, Gov. Philip D. Murphy and the two Democratic leaders of the State Legislature announced that it was time to eliminate the word — and to instead call county elected leaders “commissioners.”
Under a proposed bill, the Board of Chosen Freeholders would instead be called the Chosen Board of County Commissioners.
“As our nation tears down symbols of injustice, we must also tear down words we use in New Jersey that were born from racism,” Murphy, a Democrat, said in a joint statement with Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president, and Craig J. Coughlin, the Assembly speaker. “It’s past time for New Jersey to phase out the term ‘freeholder’ from our public discourse — a term coined when only white male landowners could hold public office.”
Support from the three top Democratic lawmakers in the state means that the bill, which is scheduled to be considered next Thursday by a Senate committee, is virtually certain to pass and become law.
“It is important that we erase the terminology that reflects racist attitudes in order to eliminate the vestiges of discriminatory practices,” Sweeney — who was once a freeholder in Gloucester County — said in a statement. “Let’s catch up with the rest of the world and call these officials who serve in public positions ‘commissioners’.”
A freeholder from Union County, Angela R. Garretson, had repeatedly urged the governor to rename the office — most recently on Thursday, at an event at the Community Food Bank of New Jersey in Hillside, New Jersey, a city where she was once mayor.
“It’s a very outmoded and outdated term,” said Garretson, who is African-American, “and it really doesn’t reflect our 21st-century ideals.”
She said she believed it was important for the title to accurately reflect the diversity of people who run for office today.
The simplicity of the new name — commissioner — will also lead to less confusion among voters, she said. “This is about breaking down barriers that have been in place for so many years.”
New Jersey’s legislative initiative comes as the discussion about the removal of symbols of hatred has intensified following nationwide protests over the killing in police custody of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.
The scope of the national debate over the appropriateness of statues or monuments has expanded rapidly beyond its original focus on Confederate leaders like Robert E. Lee.
Last month, a crowd set fire to a statue of George Washington in Portland, Oregon, and gunfire broke out during a protest in Albuquerque to demand the removal of a statue of Juan de Oñate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico.
In many places, the response has been swift.
In New York, the American Museum of Natural History announced last month that it would remove a statue of President Theodore Roosevelt, depicted astride a horse flanked by an African man and a Native American man, which had stood since 1940 outside the museum and had long been criticized as a symbol of colonialism and racism.
NASCAR said that it would ban the Confederate battle flag from its events and properties.
In New Jersey, Murphy gave up a desk used by Woodrow Wilson soon after Princeton University decided to remove the name of its onetime president from its public policy school and one of its residential colleges because of his “racist thinking and policies,” a statement from the university president said.
Few people outside New Jersey are familiar with the word “freeholder,” and the term was the subject of endless questions, said Garretson, who joined the freeholder board three years ago. With each answer, came a reminder of the word’s origin.
“Whether you were a woman, whether you were a person of color — this title didn’t fit,” she said.
John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said the title was so commonly misunderstood that freeholders would jokingly say they were members of the “Board of Frozen Cheeseholders.”
He said the confusion was more than just a matter of semantics.
“It’s one of those things that just separates random voters from people on the inside in a totally unnecessary way,” Weingart said. “Most people don’t have even the vaguest idea what county does to begin with, and this makes it slightly more mysterious.”
Jerry Walker, a Black freeholder from Hudson County, said the title not only excluded Black people but women as well. “Our country is moving forward,” he said, “and this is a great opportunity to change the narrative with titles that don’t bear that history.”

An Unexpected Struggle for Trump: Defining an Elusive Biden [With graphic(s)]

President Donald Trump won the White House in no small part by seizing on Hillary Clinton’s missteps and using them to turn many voters against her. But after three unsteady months, and with the Republican convention six weeks away, Trump is struggling to define Joe Biden to similarly devastating effect, a critical task at this stage of a presidential race.
By a combination of design and circumstance, Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has managed so far to deny Trump the sort of damaging offhand remarks, campaign clashes and clumsy encounters with voters that he used as weapons against Clinton in the last general election, as well as his Republican opponents in the 2016 primary.
This is partly because Biden has run such a low-profile campaign during the pandemic. He has had few public appearances and news conferences, which can provide the unscripted moments opponents can use to shape the public’s perception of a candidate.
But there are other obstacles for Trump that have become clear since Biden effectively won his party’s nomination in April. Biden, the former vice president, is viewed more favorably by voters than Clinton was in 2016. He is a moderate Democrat who lacks a history of harsh partisanship or scandal. And he has long appealed to white working-class voters, who are part of Trump’s base.
“It is going to be more difficult for the Trump campaign to go after a man who really is a centrist, has dealings with people across the aisle and knows how to talk to people who disagree with him,” said Priscilla Southwell, a professor emerita of political science at the University of Oregon. “And 2020 is a different kind of year. Donald Trump can appeal to his core by being negative, but it’s such a difficult time for everybody. I don’t think negativity is going to sell as well as it used to.”
Defining an opponent — putting them on the defensive with caricature — is a crucial and proven tactic for candidates in competitive races. There is a graveyard of failed contenders — names like Kennedy, McGovern, Romney, Gore and Hillary Clinton — who found themselves branded by an opponent in portrayals, often unfair, that ricocheted across the political playing field and the media.
Trump had been adept at this. But the kind of attacks that seemed so effective when he was a new-to-politics outsider in 2016 also appear to have less resonance coming from inside the White House. Four years of tweets by Trump have numbed many voters.
“It’s almost self-defeating,” said Ron Christie, a Republican who was a senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. “People are exhausted. The president, with every tweet, every insult, will move himself out of favor with the demographic that he needs the most, which is the independent.”
Trump does have some avenues to use against Biden before voter attitudes begin to harden. He has sought to tie Biden to the political unrest that has swept the country since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 by the police. And Trump has tried to portray his opponent as senile, “sleepy,” corrupt and an ally of China, but none of those lines of attack has resonated with the public, at least up to now.
His aides have signaled that Trump, incumbent or not, would run as an outsider against Biden — who has been a fixture in Washington since he was elected to the Senate in 1972 — the way he had against Clinton. Biden’s long history of votes in the Senate, as well as his eight years as an active vice president under President Barack Obama, could give Trump plenty of material.
And if Biden continues to escape definition, Trump is likely to turn to Biden’s running mate. Going after the vice presidential candidate would be an unusual but not unprecedented strategy, and might have some resonance in this election given Biden’s age; he is 77. (Trump is 74.)
Trump’s campaign had calculated that Biden, given his long history and the stumbles in the early days of his primary, would be an easier opponent to caricature.
But now time is running short.
A series of national polls has shown Trump trailing Biden, often by double digits. Even more alarming for the president, he is trailing Biden in battleground states that he won in 2016 and are likely critical to any reelection plan — including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Even states like Georgia, which once seemed clearly in Trump’s column, now appear competitive.
“Trump has much less time to pile up negatives on Biden,” said Nelson Warfield, a Republican consultant who served as press secretary for Bob Dole’s presidential campaign in 1996. “I made my first negative ad starring Hillary Clinton in 1992 and I kept doing ads criticizing her across the next 24 years. And I was by no means alone. Republicans have months to do to Biden what Republicans had over two decades to do to Hillary.”
Trump would certainly seem to have a few advantages here to make his case. He has the platform of the White House and his Twitter account. Until two months ago, he enjoyed a huge financial advantage over Biden. And Trump, unlike Biden, never had to worry this year about a primary or uniting his party behind him.
But to the frustration of Republicans, his attempts to define Biden have seemed fitful. He barely mentioned Biden during two of his campaign’s highest-profile moments in months: his speech in front of Mount Rushmore last week, followed by his July 4 address from the White House South Lawn.
And when Biden has made mistakes, Trump’s campaign has struggled to turn them to its advantage. When Biden said that any African American voter who considered supporting Trump “ain’t Black,” the Trump campaign roared into action, but the fallout lasted only a day, particularly after Biden apologized.
While Trump has filled the space on the stage that Biden has left open, he has been the one to make campaign missteps that provided fodder for Democrats, notably when he said at a rally that given the increase in positive tests for COVID-19, “I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’”
Trump has the obstacle of familiarity in trying to draw attention to his attacks. And his credibility has suffered over these past four years, which might make him an imperfect messenger to go after Biden: 67% of voters in a New York Times/Siena College poll last month said they think Trump promotes falsehoods or conspiracies very or somewhat often.
“The truth is people have heard him mocking and demonizing for four years now,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. “They are somewhat inured to it, they are sick and tired of it. And by being home, Biden has given him less to shoot at.”
The period before the conventions is typically the time when candidates make the kind of mistakes their opponents can use to set the frame for the fall campaign.
Trump’s campaign pounced when Clinton was taped saying half of Trump’s supporters were a “basket of deplorables.” Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, was caught at a private fundraiser saying 47% of Americans were “people who pay no income tax” and were “dependent upon government.”
John Kerry, as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004, was caught on video windsurfing back and forth across the Nantucket Sound. That provided the perfect image for an attack advertisement by President George W. Bush, which portrayed him as a flip-flopper, his policy positions changing with “whichever way the wind blows,” as the announcer put it. (In the process, the advertisement underlined the Bush campaign’s effort to portray Kerry as elite).
In Clinton, Trump had an unpopular opponent easy to demonize. In the final month before Election Day, 54% of respondents had an unfavorable view of her, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll. Trump was in similar straits; he was viewed unfavorably by 56% of voters, the same percentage he holds today, according to the recent Times/Siena poll.
Biden, on the other hand, was viewed unfavorably by just 42% of voters in the same poll; 52% viewed him favorably.
“That was what was historic about that race,” said Joel Benenson, who was chief strategist for Clinton. “You don’t have that now. You have Trump with that high unfavorable rating. But Biden doesn’t have that.”
“And he’s the president now,” Benenson said. “He ran as a bomb throwing presidential candidate. He could throw it at any candidate, they were the establishment. He owns it now.”
Southwell said that Biden presents a different kind of target than Clinton.
“It’s not that he hasn’t been an insider,” she said. “He’s had a different kind of upbringing and a different kind of career than Hillary Clinton.”
In many ways, Biden has turned the tables on Trump: He is running as if he were the incumbent, while Trump is acting like the challenger. The question is whether he will be able to maintain that posture through the election.
“Biden’s basement Rose Garden strategy has enabled him to play the role of a generic Democratic candidate, without the microscopic scrutiny that he would otherwise have been subjected to,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who worked for Romney. “Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton, in that he doesn’t have the built-in negatives that Hillary embodied. So, while we can absolutely still define Biden, we have significantly less time to do so.”

Trump Is Selling White Grievance. The Suburbs Aren’t Buying It. [With graphic(s)]

CORNELIUS, N.C. — On a humid Wednesday morning in this leafy lakeside suburb of Charlotte, American flags fluttered from porches along Main Street, traffic was slow, and the occasional resident ambled out for a walk.
There was only one visible sign of the anger and anxiety that have coursed through this community and so many others across the nation in recent weeks: “Racist,” read the faded black graffiti at the base of a Confederate memorial, the kind of statue President Donald Trump has vowed to preserve amid a national discussion of racism in America.
Down the street, as she loaded groceries into her car, Elizabeth Stewart of Davidson, North Carolina, vented her frustrations about Trump’s incendiary approach.
“He’s trying to appeal to a base that’s gotten more and more narrow,” said Stewart, a small-business owner who supported Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race and Hillary Clinton in 2016 and will support Joe Biden this year. “It’s just extremely divisive.”
From North Carolina to Pennsylvania to Arizona, interviews this week with more than two dozen suburban voters in critical swing states revealed abhorrence for Trump’s growing efforts to fuel white resentment with inflammatory rhetoric on race and cultural heritage. The discomfort was palpable even among voters who also dislike the recent toppling of Confederate statues or who say they agree with some of Trump’s policies.
As the president increasingly stakes his candidacy on a message of “law and order,” casting himself as a bulwark against “angry mobs” and “thugs,’’ there are signs that he is especially alienating voters in bedroom communities who approach the debate over racial justice with a far more nuanced perspective than the president does.
It’s a tumultuous time in the country, and attitudes are fluid. A Monmouth University poll released this week found that Republicans — who still overwhelmingly support the president — were less than half as likely to express sympathy for the demonstrators’ anger as they had been four weeks earlier, when the protest movement was first gaining steam. And some strategists warn that there is political risk for Democrats if swing voters begin to perceive them as radical.
But among most Americans, the poll found, support for protesters continued to run high — and so did concern over Trump’s rhetoric, sentiment that was reflected on the ground in swing state suburbs like Cornelius — traditionally a conservative-leaning area — and along the Main Line outside Philadelphia.
“It’s a disgrace,” said Jane Scilovati, a schoolteacher from Devon, Pennsylvania, along Philadelphia’s wealthy Main Line. She voted for Trump in 2016 but said she now regrets the decision. She called the president’s recent handling of racial issues “deplorable.”
“He doesn’t have any compassion or empathy; he doesn’t reference historical facts correctly,” she said in an interview outside a supermarket. “He’s brought more division to this country than we’ve seen since the Civil Rights Act.”
Scilovati, 54, said she would support “Daffy Duck” rather than the president in this year’s election.
While Trump won suburban areas overall by 4 percentage points in 2016, according to exit polls, white college-educated suburban women have rapidly moved away from his Republican Party, and they helped deliver the House of Representatives to the Democrats in 2018. And now, as some polling shows Trump facing competitive races even in deep-red states, he cannot afford to lose all of those voters again.
In the Monmouth poll this week, among white Americans with college degrees, only 13% said that Trump’s response to the protesters had improved the situation. Seventy-six percent of these college-educated white Americans said that he had made things worse.
Yet this week, in interview after interview, suburbanites who have been open to voting for either party in recent years described Trump as a polarizing and deeply flawed messenger on the most searing issue of the day.
“College-educated suburban women do not want to support someone who is perceived to be intolerant on racial issues,” said Whit Ayres, the veteran Republican pollster. “That has been true for many years and is particularly true now after the George Floyd killing.”
The killing of Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck, sparked a nationwide outcry this summer over police brutality and racism. But in recent weeks, Trump has made playing on white fears an explicit part of his campaign pitch in a way no other major presidential campaign has approached in at least a generation.
He has defended the Confederate flag and falsely accused a Black NASCAR driver of perpetrating a “hoax” involving a noose. He has described the phrase “Black Lives Matter” as a “symbol of hate.” In an address last week at Mount Rushmore, the president painted a dark portrait of a nation whose values were under attack by “the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters” — an echo of his inaugural address depiction of “American carnage.”
Taken together, it is an approach that is out of step with corporate America, a number of Republican officials, military leaders and the majority, polls show, of U.S. voters, though there are partisan divisions around views on racial injustice.
At the Harris Teeter supermarket here in Cornelius, Marisa Pascucci, 45, was another voter who had changed her mind since 2016. She did not vote for either presidential candidate that year. Now a self-described “recovering Republican,” she intends to come off the sidelines to vote for Biden, she said.
On issues of race, she said, Trump “is biased and is purposely saying things to spark things. I don’t agree with the way he instigates things.”
She held that view even as she also expressed discomfort with the destruction of Confederate statues. They may belong in museums where they can be “put in context, not up on a pedestal,” she said, but should not be destroyed.
In North Carolina, a rare competitive battleground state in the South, the controversies surrounding Confederate symbols, and Trump’s views on those issues, are especially fraught. In a state that is home to the Research Triangle in the Raleigh area, a museum in Charlotte dedicated to championing the “New South” and an influx of newcomers in recent years, many residents recoil at Trump’s defense of those symbols.
In a recent survey of North Carolina by The New York Times and Siena College, 51% of registered voters in the Charlotte suburbs disapproved of Trump’s handling of recent protests, compared with 44% who approved.
“We’re a changing and evolving district; the ‘Lost Cause’ narrative is no longer relevant,” said Democratic state Rep. Christy Clark, who flipped this statehouse seat from Republican control in 2018 and faces a competitive reelection fight. “We need to pay attention to racism in our society.”
Asked about Trump’s remarks in defense of the Confederate flag (“Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!” he tweeted, in reference to NASCAR’s decision to ban Confederate flags from its events), she said, “Trying to hold tight to it as a national narrative is tone deaf.”
Johanna Godlewski, 35, an occupational therapist from Radnor, Pennsylvania, said she was uncomfortable with removing statues that commemorate heroes of the Confederacy or others who perpetuated racism.
“That’s a little different, because I still believe it’s a part of history,” she said.
But she also said she believed that Trump was stoking intolerance and that he is a racist — “The way he speaks about women so roughly, I can see him saying the same thing racially,” she said.
Godlewski voted for Clinton and is undecided this year. But she said she would be unlikely to support the president because her husband is a police officer, and she fears he would confront more protests if Trump is reelected — a direct rebuke to Trump’s claim that he is the candidate who can bring order.
The Trump campaign, for its part, is working to cast the Democratic Party as filled with extremists who support unfettered property destruction, violent protests and defunding of police (Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has objected to all of that). The campaign is working to play on the concerns of voters who believe some acts of protest have gone too far.
In a statement, a Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, defended the president’s record on race, noting his work on criminal justice reform and saying that his economic policies had benefited people of color.
“The president’s unifying message at Mount Rushmore made clear that he is proud of America as having done more to advance individual liberties for all people than any nation in the history of the world,” he said.
Certainly, some suburban voters remain ardent Trump defenders, standing by his response to the unrest.
They described Trump in familiar terms: They dislike his social media presence but continue to trust him on the economy despite the unemployment crisis amid the pandemic. They say that the news media and the Democrats have not given him a fair shake. Some cheered his language about protesters and want to see him embrace a tougher line.
“Trashing places shouldn’t be our statement,” said Patricia Hamilton, 40, a resident of Marana, a conservative suburb of Tucson, Arizona. “We should not be throwing fits. And I get we’ve got issues in this country, but we’re still the greatest country in the world.”
Some white Trump supporters also said they saw racism as an intractable problem and chose to focus on other aspects of Trump’s record, saying that he was doing the best job possible under difficult circumstances.
“It’s one of those issues that’s going to take time to resolve,” said Chris Berglund, 40, of Morrisville, North Carolina, who said he had “no opinion” of the president’s handling of racial matters and emphasized instead Trump’s handling of the economy. “He’s done a great job so far, turned the economy around, low unemployment — well, not right now, but there’s not anybody who could do that with the pandemic going on.”
But in the supermarket parking lot near the Confederate monument in Cornelius, Shaneika Guy could not overlook the statue — or Trump’s painful approach, in her view, to race.
“I want it to come down; I feel like it’s racism,” she said of the monument. Guy, 34, has not yet decided whether she will vote for Biden, but she will not support Trump.
“I don’t think he’s very compassionate about either race, even his own,” she said.

Mayor Shouldn't Oversee N.Y.P.D., State Attorney General Says: [National Desk]

Full text: Citing police misconduct at protests, the attorney general said an independent panel should oversee the city police and hire the commissioner.
One officer in Brooklyn pulled down a protester's mask and pepper-sprayed him. Another officer shoved a young woman to the ground, knocking her head against the pavement and giving her a concussion. An officer in Manhattan pulled a gun and waved it at protesters after one of his colleagues was hit in the head with an thrown object.
These incidents were described in a lengthy report that the state attorney general released Wednesday after hearings into the Police Department's handling of recent protests against police brutality and racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd.
Saying the protests had shaken New Yorkers' belief in the Police Department, the attorney general, Letitia James, recommended that an independent panel -- not the mayor -- should appoint the police commissioner and oversee the hiring and firing of officers.
"It is impossible to deny that many New Yorkers have lost faith in law enforcement," Ms. James said during a call with reporters to discuss her findings. "I believe we need to bridge the undeniable divide between police and the public."
The report also recommended that the police suspend the use of aggressive crowd control tactics like kettling, a maneuver employed at peaceful protests last month in which officers surrounded protesters, then closed in, swinging batons, and arrested many of them.
Ms. James also called on lawmakers to pass into law the rules about the use of force laid out in the department's patrol guide, making it easier to prosecute officers who violate them.
Appointing an independent commission to oversee the city's police force would be a landmark change for the New York City government. Since the 19th century, the police commissioner has served at the mayor's pleasure, inextricably linking the political fortunes of City Hall to the Police Department.
To change that arrangement would most likely require actions by the City Council and State Legislature and would face opposition not only from City Hall but from police unions and leaders of the Police Department, an insular institution that historically has been slow to embrace such foundational shifts.
The commission Ms. James envisions would include representatives appointed by the City Council, the mayor's office, the city's public advocate and the city comptroller's office. Detroit and San Francisco, the report notes, have similar arrangements.
Richard Esposito, the Police Department's chief spokesman, dismissed the report's recommendations on Wednesday afternoon as unnecessary and called Ms. James's investigation "political."
A spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio immediately rejected the proposal of removing the police from the mayor's control. Ms. James is an ally of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has frequently clashed with Mr. de Blasio.
"While we thank the attorney general for her investigation and look forward to reviewing the report in full and working together to further reform policing in this city, we do not believe creating a commission to oversee the N.Y.P.D. does that," the spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said.
In her call with reporters, Ms. James noted the police department has not been subject to the same kind of legislative oversight as other city agencies. It can make rule changes, for instance, without public hearings.
"Why is this one agency treated so differently than all of the others?" Ms. James said. "The police should not police themselves, period."
The report comes as a political movement to rein in police powers and hold officers accountable for abuse has gained momentum, not just in the city, but across the nation. In New York City, tens of thousands of people have marched in the streets protesting police brutality.
The demonstrations, which have lasted more than six weeks, have led to new state laws outlawing aggressive policing tactics like chokeholds and making police disciplinary records more transparent. Responding to calls from protesters to "defund the police," the City Council has shifted close to $ 1 billion from the department's $ 6 billion budget.
In May, Gov. Cuomo appointed Ms. James to investigate the interactions between the New York Police Department and the public, after widespread reports that the police had pepper sprayed, attacked and violently arrested peaceful protesters.
Ms. James, a Brooklyn Democrat who took office in January 2019, said her office had received more than 1,300 submissions from people reporting misconduct by the police during its enforcement of the protests.
She said her office was weighing whether to recommend criminal charges against specific officers who were found to have used excessive force. So far one officer has been charged with assault after a video emerged of him shoving a young woman to the ground during a protest.
Investigators with Ms. James's office found that more than 2,000 people were arrested during the first week of protests in the city, from May 28 to June 7. Many were arrested after 8 p.m., she said, in the days after Mayor Bill de Blasio imposed a curfew, "suggesting the curfew was a significant driver of arrests."
Of those arrested, Black and Latino protesters were more likely to be charged with a felony than white protesters, the report said.
It is unclear how many, if any, of Ms. James's recommendations will be embraced by the City Council and State Legislature, which would have to enact some of them. The City Charter says that the mayor is in charge of hiring and firing police commissioners, and changing that provision might require a referendum.
The governor's office and leaders in the State Assembly and Senate said they were reviewing the report.The City Council speaker did not immediately respond to the report.
Ms. James, who is currently the highest-ranking Black elected official in the state, has no power as attorney general to institute the changes she has proposed, but she has been vocal in the debate over other policing issues.
As the city's public advocate, for instance, she was an early supporter of outfitting New York officers with body cameras in 2016. Thousands of officers now patrol the city with the equipment.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — When it first kicked off last month, the activist encampment that billed itself as Occupy City Hall was viewed as the latest wave of the city’s George Floyd protests — an innovative political space that, under summer skies, attracted peaceful crowds to speeches and teach-ins focused on a narrow goal: cutting $1 billion from the New York Police Department’s budget.
In the past week, however, the number of protesters has dropped off sharply and those who have remained have taken on a new responsibility: caring for dozens of homeless people who were drawn to the compound for its free food, open-air camping and communal sensibility.
It has not been easy.
Brawls have erupted. Passers-by and journalists have been harassed. Local residents — even those who say they support the camp’s politics — have complained that it has turned into a disorderly shantytown where violence has occurred. Several medics who had been there from the start announced this week that they were leaving, citing “a lack of safety” in a statement.
The coronavirus has also become a growing concern as people cluster together, sometimes without masks.
On recent nights, about 100 people have typically slept in tents and on the ground in the park, most of whom are considered homeless, organizers said. Signs decrying racism and the police are everywhere, taped to tables or attached to metal fences. On many days, music blares out of speakers.
The organizers of the camp — renamed Abolition Park — defended the project, saying that by serving meals to homeless people and helping to provide a safe place to sleep, they are doing what they said the city had not: addressing the needs of its most vulnerable residents.
They acknowledged that disagreements, even acts of violence, had occurred in the park, but they said they were looking for ways to deal with such troubles without involving the police.
“It’s not pretty all the time — and we’re not just going to abandon it because it’s not pretty right now,” said Desirae, the 20-year-old leader of the compound’s media team, who declined to give her last name. “We’re going to stay here through the ugly.”
The camp, just feet from City Hall, presents a thorny political problem for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been criticized by the demonstrators — and by his Black supporters — since the George Floyd demonstrations started in late May.
A spokeswoman for the mayor declined to comment, noting only that since the protests at City Hall Park started, there have been 12 complaints to the 311 hotline about the area near City Hall, none of them concerning homeless people.
The Police Department referred all questions to the mayor’s office.
Some organizers said the complications were the inevitable growing pains of “unlearning and relearning” concepts such as leadership, ownership and safety.
Others said they considered this past week a transition stage as their movement, which is led by Black organizers, figured out internal structures, communication strategies and programming that can be sustained long-term. The physical space is also being reorganized, and a new “grand opening” is expected soon, they said.
And they said they were taking steps to curb the spread of the coronavirus, distributing masks and sanitizer.
Still, there have been tense situations, including violence.
At a community gathering Tuesday night, several protesters clashed with one another verbally and physically. Then on Wednesday morning, two more protesters assaulted a person who entered the encampment with a sign proclaiming support for the police.
Throughout the day Wednesday, joggers and passersby — including one reporter — were confronted by people in the park, accused of having trespassed or of being spies for the police.
Over the weekend, a resident of 49 Chambers Street, a condominium complex across from the camp, said in an email that some people from the camp had tried to break into the building and had threatened to burn it down.
“We’ve spoken to the NYPD, and the response was that the mayor’s office ordered them to stand down and not interfere with crimes being committed on this specific block,” the resident said. “This leaves our building — the only residential building out of multiple government buildings on the block — defenseless.”
The occupation began June 23 when about 100 people, led by the grassroots group Vocal-NY, set up shop on a small patch of grass to the east of City Hall with the singular mission of bringing pressure on the City Council to cut the Police Department’s funding at an upcoming vote before the July 1 budget deadline.
The little squatters’ colony grew into a kind of happy Hooverville, a sprawl of tarps, tents and bedrolls that spread through the plaza that lies between City Hall and the ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge. There were food tables, cleaning crews, a hand-sanitizing station and even a library where campers could go to hear lectures on the school-to-prison pipeline.
While the protest was mostly peaceful, the facade of the nearby Surrogate Court’s building on Chambers Street was marred with graffiti, though it was not known who was responsible.
The encampment reached its peak June 30 when thousands of people crowded into the plaza after dark to watch the Council vote on a giant video screen.
While the Council ultimately decided to shift nearly $1 billion away from the police, many of the protesters expressed disappointment, wanting deeper cuts. Most of them, along with leaders from Vocal-NY, went home within days.
But some, like Adi Sragovich, stayed — largely, she said, out of a sense of duty to the homeless people who had in the meantime flocked to the park.
On Wednesday morning, Sragovich, 20, was still at the compound, fixing people sandwiches and plastic bags of granola for breakfast.
“It felt unethical pulling out,” she said.
Beyond the free meals and the help-yourself clothes bin, the park activists have set up a makeshift mental health tent, where a licensed social worker has been advising people suffering from trauma, mental illness or substance abuse.
A team of volunteer “de-escalators” has also been drafted to move about the camp defusing disputes and soothing frayed tempers.
“This space has transitioned a lot in the last two weeks,” said René Jean-Baptiste, 24, a protester who has been at the camp since the beginning. “We know it’s not permanent, but it is a safe space, and we’re trying to get the people the services they need.”
David Terry said he appreciated the gesture. A few weeks ago, Terry, 56, said he became homeless when a fire damaged his apartment in Harlem. He made his way to the camp near City Hall. Now he spends his days listening to the music in the plaza or lounging about with others talking politics. He has even tried his hand at the meditation tent.
“There’s other places I could go,” he said, “but I like it here.”
At least so far, organizers have not come up with a specific list of demands or any explicit agenda for this latest version of the camp. But they have said they would like to refocus the conversation more on abolishing the police than merely defunding it.
“Abolishing prisons and police does not just mean subtracting those institutions from society but building a world where everyone gets the care they need,” said Katherine, 27, an organizer who would not give her last name.
Twice during the occupation’s first phase, before July 1, scores of police officers pushed into the park and fought with large crowds of protesters, leading to arrests and injuries. But in the past few days, while the police have loomed in the distance, there have been no physical confrontations.
Some activists said they were more worried about outsiders or those within the camp.
“This is a utopia among chaos,” said a man who calls himself Professor Kannon and has been giving history lessons on police brutality and civil rights since the start of the encampment.
“We have disputes and disagreements — if we didn’t, we wouldn’t be a family,” Professor Kannon said. “The only people in here that’s going to harm us — is us.”

Five former detention officers and a nurse at a North Carolina jail have been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of a Black man who repeatedly exclaimed, “I can’t breathe,” as the officers tried unsuccessfully to remove his handcuffs, a county prosecutor said Wednesday.
The man, John Neville, 56, had been booked into the Forsyth County jail in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Dec. 1, on a charge of assaulting a woman, according to authorities. About 24 hours later, Neville had an unknown medical condition that caused him to fall from the top bunk of his cell and hit the concrete floor, according to the Forsyth County district attorney, Jim O’Neill.
Detention officers and an on-call nurse found Neville disoriented and confused and took him to an observation cell, O’Neill said at a news conference Wednesday.
O’Neill did not detail what happened next, or say specifically what role prosecutors believe the officers and the nurse had in Neville’s death. But he said that over the next 45 minutes, Neville “would sustain injuries that would eventually cause him to lose his life.”
The episode was captured on video, and O’Neill said that an autopsy report found that Neville repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe,” as officers tried to remove his handcuffs. The autopsy found that Neville died of a brain injury because of cardiopulmonary arrest that was caused by “positional and compressional asphyxia during prone restraint.” The report also cited other “significant conditions” that Neville had, O’Neill said, including “acute altered mental status” and asthma. Neville died on Dec. 4, 2019, at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.
The charges were the latest to be brought in the death of a Black man at the hands of law enforcement officers since the killing of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police touched off global protests against police brutality and systemic racism. Neville’s plea — “I can’t breathe” — was the same one uttered by Floyd and by Eric Garner, another Black man, who died in 2014 after a New York City police officer held him in a chokehold on a sidewalk.
Over the past decade, The New York Times found, at least 70 people in the country have died in police custody after saying the same three words: “I can’t breathe.”
At the news conference Wednesday, O’Neill addressed Neville’s son, Sean Neville, and daughter, Brienne Thornton Neville.
“We have all been witnesses to the unrest that has gripped our world over the last several weeks,” O’Neill said. “As it relates specifically to your father, Mr. Neville, his death was avoidable and that is a tragic, singular fact.”
O’Neill said he would not release video of the episode “unless and until we reach a proper court of law.” He said that it was important for a jury or judge not to have “preconceived opinions” about the guilt or innocence of those charged.
The five former officers charged were Lavette Williams, 47; Edward Roussel, 50; Christopher Stamper, 42; Antonio Woodley, 26; and Sarah Poole, 36. The Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office said it had fired all of them Tuesday, with the exception of Stamper, who was fired Wednesday. The nurse who was charged, Michelle Heughins, was employed by a private contractor, according to the sheriff’s office. Williams and Woodley are Black, the sheriff’s office said. The rest of the officers are white.
“Good men and women made bad decisions that day and, as a result, a good man died,” the Forsyth County sheriff, Bobby F. Kimbrough Jr., whose office runs the county jail, said at the news conference.
Kimbrough said that the five former officers had asked him to relay a message to Neville’s children, as he walked them into a magistrate’s office to be charged Wednesday.
“They said, ‘Sheriff, tell them that we meant their father no harm — we were trying to assist and help,’ ” Kimbrough said. “We are sorry that the mistakes were made that day. I take responsibility for that, as the sheriff.”
It was not immediately clear if all of those charged had lawyers. David Freedman, a lawyer for Roussel, said the officers were released on $15,000 unsecured bonds. Freedman said his client had been in law enforcement for 30 years, had a clean record and was cooperating with the authorities.
“This was not an arrest,” Freedman said. “This was a medical emergency and he was following standard operating procedure and they had a nurse supervising the procedure.”
Heughins’ employer, Wellpath, said it was saddened by Neville’s death.
“We are confident that a review of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Neville’s death will show that Nurse Heughins acted professionally and reasonably in trying to save his life,” the company said in a statement. “Nurse Heughins engaged in no misconduct, but rather provided compassionate quality medical care.”
Neville had worked in construction, had been married twice and lived in Greensboro, North Carolina, according to a lawyer for his family, Michael A. Grace.
After Neville died, the sheriff’s office asked the state authorities to investigate but did not publicly acknowledge the death until last month, nearly seven months after it occurred, according to The Winston-Salem Journal. Kimbrough had said that Neville’s family had asked him to keep the death private.
Grace said the family appreciated the way the sheriff’s office and the district attorney’s office had handled the case.
“I can tell you the family, though grieving, is satisfied that the process is working,” Grace said. “This is a tragedy all around. It was just unfortunate.”
Protesters have invoked Neville’s name outside the governor’s residence in Raleigh, North Carolina, and at another demonstration Wednesday evening outside the Forsyth County jail, according to The Winston-Salem Journal.
O’Neill, a Republican who is running for state attorney general, said he supported the right to protest but would not tolerate “protesters who cross the line and break the law, for you, too, will be prosecuted.”
“This is our home,” he said, once again addressing Neville’s children. “This is our community, and we will protect it. And we will look after it in the same manner that we look after your father today.”

NEW YORK — One officer in Brooklyn pulled down a protester’s mask and pepper-sprayed him. Another officer shoved a young woman to the ground, knocking her head against the pavement and giving her a concussion. An officer in Manhattan pulled a gun and waved it at protesters after one of his colleagues was hit in the head with an thrown object.
These incidents were described in a lengthy report that the state attorney general released Wednesday after hearings into the Police Department’s handling of recent protests against police brutality and racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd.
Saying the protests had shaken New Yorkers’ belief in the Police Department, the attorney general, Letitia James, recommended that an independent panel — not the mayor — should appoint the police commissioner and oversee the hiring and firing of officers.
“It is impossible to deny that many New Yorkers have lost faith in law enforcement,” James said during a call with reporters to discuss her findings. “I believe we need to bridge the undeniable divide between police and the public.”
The report also recommended that the police suspend the use of aggressive crowd control tactics like kettling, a maneuver employed at peaceful protests last month in which officers surrounded protesters, then closed in, swinging batons, and arrested many of them.
James also called on lawmakers to pass into law the rules about the use of force laid out in the department’s patrol guide, making it easier to prosecute officers who violate them.
Appointing an independent commission to oversee the city’s police force would be a landmark change for the New York City government. Since the 19th century, the police commissioner has served at the mayor’s pleasure, inextricably linking the political fortunes of City Hall to the Police Department.
To change that arrangement would most likely require actions by the City Council and State Legislature and would face opposition not only from City Hall but from police unions and leaders of the Police Department, an insular institution that historically has been slow to embrace such foundational shifts.
The commission James envisions would include representatives appointed by the City Council, the mayor’s office, the city’s public advocate and the city comptroller’s office. Detroit and San Francisco, the report notes, have similar arrangements.
Richard Esposito, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, dismissed the report’s recommendations Wednesday afternoon as unnecessary and called James’ investigation “political.”
A spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio immediately rejected the proposal of removing the police from the mayor’s control. James is an ally of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has frequently clashed with de Blasio.
“While we thank the attorney general for her investigation and look forward to reviewing the report in full and working together to further reform policing in this city, we do not believe creating a commission to oversee the NYPD does that,” the spokesman, Freddi Goldstein, said.
In her call with reporters, James noted the police department has not been subject to the same kind of legislative oversight as other city agencies. It can make rule changes, for instance, without public hearings.
“Why is this one agency treated so differently than all of the others?” James said. “The police should not police themselves, period.”
The report comes as a political movement to rein in police powers and hold officers accountable for abuse has gained momentum, not just in the city, but across the nation. In New York City, tens of thousands of people have marched in the streets protesting police brutality.
The demonstrations, which have lasted more than six weeks, have led to new state laws outlawing aggressive policing tactics like chokeholds and making police disciplinary records more transparent. Responding to calls from protesters to “defund the police,” the City Council has shifted close to $1 billion from the department’s $6 billion budget.
In May, Cuomo appointed James to investigate the interactions between the New York Police Department and the public, after widespread reports that the police had pepper sprayed, attacked and violently arrested peaceful protesters.
James, a Brooklyn Democrat who took office in January 2019, said her office had received more than 1,300 submissions from people reporting misconduct by the police during its enforcement of the protests.
She said her office was weighing whether to recommend criminal charges against specific officers who were found to have used excessive force. So far one officer has been charged with assault after a video emerged of him shoving a young woman to the ground during a protest.
Investigators with James’ office found that more than 2,000 people were arrested during the first week of protests in the city, from May 28 to June 7. Many were arrested after 8 p.m., she said, in the days after de Blasio imposed a curfew, “suggesting the curfew was a significant driver of arrests.”
Of those arrested, Black and Latino protesters were more likely than white protesters to be charged with a felony than white protesters, the report said.
It is unclear how many, if any, of James’ recommendations will be embraced by the City Council and State Legislature, which would have to enact some of them.
The governor’s office and leaders in the State Assembly and Senate said they were reviewing the report. The City Council speaker did not immediately respond to the report.
James, who is currently the highest-ranking Black elected official in the state, has no power as attorney general to institute the changes she has proposed, but she has been vocal in the debate over other policing issues.
As the city’s public advocate, for instance, she was an early supporter of outfitting New York officers with body cameras in 2016. Thousands of officers now patrol the city with the equipment.

NEW YORK — At Indian Road Cafe in upper Manhattan, a Black Lives Matter sign hangs in a front window. Local writers, artists, musicians and political activists are regulars. And for years, two drag queens have hosted a monthly charity bingo tournament there.
Many in the surrounding Inwood neighborhood considered it a community hub and a progressive oasis.
But then the cafe’s owner, Thomas Bosco, said in an MSNBC interview in late spring that he voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 and was likely to do so again.
The backlash was swift, as you might expect.
Neighbors railed in the comments on various neighborhood Facebook groups, posting hundreds of angry messages aimed at the cafe — and one another. Some people called for a boycott.
“How could I be against Trump and all that he stands for and go somewhere and patronize someone who supports this demon?” Douglas Henderson, 62, a lawyer and nearby resident, said in an interview.
Glennis Aquino-Gil, 37, a resident of Riverdale, in the Bronx, vowed she would never go to Indian Road again.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who lives nearby, wrote on Facebook: “It’s hard to ever go back.”
The two drag queens have said they will move their show to a different venue.
The controversy, coming in the middle of a pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests, shows how in a highly polarized social media era, a few comments in an interview can reverberate: Bosco said the fallout from his TV appearance, in a segment about small-business owners and workers, might put him out of business.
Soon after the TV appearance circulated online, Bosco posted an open letter to the community — “the community I live in, a community I love, respect, and serve” — defending his answer to the question about Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.
In the appearance, Bosco said that the president had made missteps, “but at the end of the day, I support him. I support my governor, and I support my mayor.” Bosco then said he voted for Trump in 2016 and planned to do so again.
In his open letter, Bosco wrote that he had “answered honestly and from the heart,” but his response had been presented without context. He said that what was in the video did not include that he had supported the last four presidents and that he had “found many things troubling about our administration.”
“I’m a liberal guy who supports almost every liberal cause I can think of,” Bosco said recently while sitting inside his cafe, empty because of the current ban on indoor dining.
When a worker did not have child care, Bosco provided it on-site, Bosco and another employee said. They also said that when a different worker feared being stopped by police and questioned about his immigration status, Bosco drove that person to and from the cafe.
And on the Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, Bosco organized a brunch to raise money for an immigrants’ advocacy organization.
He struggled to explain how he voted for Trump in 2016 after having supported Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a progressive Democrat, earlier that year. Eventually, he settled on the phrase “small government, big community.”
Now, Bosco says, he is not sure whom he will support in November. “My staff feels like I let them down to a certain extent,” Bosco said.
“They feel like when I answered that question that I didn’t think about them” as employees of the cafe he was representing, he added. “And that hurts. I wish I had it back.”
Similar backlashes have erupted in liberal New York City, usually after a business is revealed to have financial links to Trump or socially conservative causes.
Last year, the management at high-end fitness chains Equinox and SoulCycle faced a blowback from members after it was reported that the outlets were financially linked to Stephen Ross, a real estate developer who planned to host a fundraiser in the Hamptons for Trump.
But Bosco is no Stephen Ross. Bosco has not made donations to any political campaign, according to city, state and federal records online. And Indian Road is not a chain.
“Does he know where his restaurant is?” asked Caroline Montero, 29, from nearby Washington Heights. The cafe, which will change its name to Inwood Farm this month, is in a gentrifying area with many immigrants.
“Where’s your loyalty?” she added, as she sat in a park across the street from the cafe with Aquino-Gil and another friend. Sipping drinks purchased from a park vendor, all three vowed to no longer patronize the cafe.
Vivian Llodrá, 49, of Inwood, was one of the first to post Bosco’s interview in a neighborhood Facebook group. She said that what he had done locally paled in comparison to how he had voted. “He broke the trust with the community,” she said.
“I appreciate that he’s given money to immigrants rights groups and donated to food pantries,” Llodrá said in an interview. “That’s great. But it doesn’t take away the fact that he voted for someone in 2016 and planned to vote for someone in 2020 who will take away my rights.”
Hawk Newsome, chairman of an independent Black Lives Matter group in Manhattan, said, “I wouldn’t say there is no coming back from supporting Donald Trump, but it is a very long road to redemption.”
On a recent sunny afternoon, customers sat at small tables under the cafe’s awning. “There’s no controversy with me,” said Jason Claiborne, 43, a creative director for a publishing company and a longtime Inwood resident.
“If he is a racist, right-wing supremacist, he’s hiding it so goddamn good,” Claiborne said.
He was later joined by a friend, Andre Wallace, a former mayor of Mount Vernon, which lies just north of the city. Patronizing the cafe, Wallace said, had nothing to do with the cafe owner’s vote in the presidential race.
“I don’t see why I would mix the two,” said Wallace, 52, a Democrat.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
DETROIT — John James still feels the sting from the harrowing encounters and indignities he has experienced as a young Black man crossing paths with the police.
He recently recalled the time he was with the woman who is now his wife at an upscale mall in suburban Detroit and two officers approached them in their car, guns drawn. Had his wife, who is white, not been there to de-escalate the situation, he said, “I don’t know what would have happened.”
A few years later, he was pulled over with one of their sons in the back seat. At the sight of the flashing blue and red lights, he asked himself if this was the day his child “sees his daddy bleed out in the street.” The West Point graduate and Apache helicopter pilot who once flew combat missions in Iraq came to a chilling conclusion: He could be killed during a traffic stop in the suburbs just as easily as he could have been killed at war.
These are the kinds of stories that James, a Republican candidate for Senate in Michigan, said he hoped would help white Americans better understand the issues of racial justice now at the forefront of an election unlike any in his lifetime.
“I didn’t see the George Floyd video — I felt it,” said James, 39, explaining in an interview last week how watching Floyd dying under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer underscored his motivation for running. “We don’t have enough people making decisions who feel the consequences of their actions.”
The message seems ideal for this moment of racial awakening in America. But many Michigan voters aren’t drawn to James, in no small part because of what he isn’t saying.
James has refused to utter anything but the most gentle and equivocating criticism of President Donald Trump, sticking to a playbook that he hopes will keep Michigan’s white, Trump-supporting conservatives from turning against him.
But at a time when polls show that Americans overwhelmingly mistrust Trump’s handling of race relations, James — the only Black candidate Republicans expect to have on the ballot for Senate this fall — is grappling with a complicated reality as he tries to balance his identity with his ambitions for office in Trump’s Republican Party.
His cautious approach has stirred a debate among African-American supporters and opponents alike. Hasn’t the time long passed for hedged and ambivalent responses to the president’s remarks on race? And what defines someone like James first: being Black or being a Republican?
James’ response is neither; he is an American. But other answers haven’t come so easily. He said his impulse after seeing the Floyd tape was to call his father and head to a Black Lives Matter protest. But then he decided against protesting, reasoning he could do more to help through his campaign.
Recently, when he and his wife tried to explain the protests to their 5-year-old son, the boy didn’t understand. “I thought Martin Luther King fixed that,” James recalled his son saying.
Many Black Americans say there has never been a time when the answers are so clear and the lines so bright. And Trump’s offenses against them are legion. He has defended white supremacists and the Confederate flag; spread racist content on social media; rolled back efforts to reform police departments with a history of discrimination; attacked Black athletes as dumb and unpatriotic; and initially refused to disavow an endorsement from David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
“At some point, John is going to have to separate himself and demonstrate a stronger voice, an independent voice,” said Jimmy Greene, a businessman in Saginaw who has helped raise money to support James.
Greene pointed to a commercial playing on heavy rotation in Michigan in which James, who says in the ad that he will be a “unifier,” condemns the killing of Floyd as a “cowardly act of evil.” Then, in the next breath, James calls out the rioting and looting that took place during some of the protests, which were largely peaceful, as “criminal” — a talking point that Republicans have poll-tested and believe gives their candidates a more palatable way to express support for the demonstrations while also nodding to disapproving white conservatives.
Greene said it was gratuitous to draw attention to isolated instances of violence.
“That was terrible,” he said, adding that there were certain things like Floyd’s killing and Trump’s racism that couldn’t be papered over with ambiguity. “Call it what it is,” he said. “Put periods at the end of things. Don’t use semicolons and commas and parentheses and ‘buts.’”
Asked to describe James’ predicament, Republicans have used phrases like “in a bind,” “walking a tightrope” or “against a wall.”
If he were running under a Republican president who did not so openly provoke racial animus, James could have had an easier time becoming the breakout star his supporters see.
He has the commanding bearing of an Army officer and a confident stage presence honed in high school as a member of the drama club. After eight years in the Army, he earned two master’s degrees and now runs Renaissance Global Logistics, a shipping business that is part of the company his father started after moving to Michigan from segregated Mississippi in the 1960s. He made his first Senate bid two years ago, against Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Though he lost by 6.5 points, it was a stronger showing than many expected.
Republican donors find him appealing. An aide to James said he had raised “well over” $6 million in the period from April through June, which would put him ahead of other Republicans in high-profile Senate races like Susan Collins, the incumbent in Maine who reported raising about half that amount. Second quarter figures won’t be finalized until the middle of this month, but in the previous two quarters James out-raised his challenger, Sen. Gary Peters, a first-term Democrat who keeps a relatively low profile.
“He has a story to tell,” said Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and a former leader of the Michigan Republican Party, adding that James had the potential to shine against an opponent who was not a brand name in Michigan politics. “There’s a real opportunity for John to have a breakout moment.”
But James has struggled to find that moment, even now. He has held back when asked about his stance on stripping Confederate names from military bases, repeating Trump’s warnings not to “rewrite history” before allowing, “If the military wants to rename its bases, it’s fine by me.”
And asked during the interview about the president’s decision to post a video on Twitter last month that showed a supporter of his shouting “white power,” James said only that he agreed with Trump’s decision to delete the post a few hours after sharing it.
Pressed on whether Trump had been wrong to share a white supremacist chant on his Twitter feed, James declined to answer, putting his thumb and forefinger together in the shape of a zero to demonstrate how little attention he had paid to the tweets.
“We are competing against nations that think in terms of dynasties and centuries,” he said, criticizing what he called the small-mindedness of our politics. “Who’s out there laying the vision for who we want to be?”
Republicans in Michigan have proved before that they can win statewide office without widespread support from Black voters, and this appears to be the path to victory that James’ advisers envision. They did not offer a prediction when asked if he would do better than single digits among Black voters, the typical high-water mark for most Republicans in recent elections.
Trump won Michigan in 2016 by just 10,000 votes — his thinnest margin in any state. But that edge is gone today. Public polling, along with private Republican surveys of the state, show Trump has slipped far behind former Vice President Joe Biden, in some cases by double digits. And while the latest internal Republican surveys show James doing slightly better than the president, Republicans familiar with the numbers said he was still behind. A June New York Times/Siena College poll had him down 10 points.
“I think there are people who are troubled by the current numbers,” said Stu Sandler, a strategist working for James in Michigan, referring to the president’s standing. At the same time, Sandler added, “A lot of the same people who cautioned Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016, saying, ‘You’ve got a problem in Michigan,’ are saying today these numbers are not going to stay like this.”
Critics said that James had missed an opportunity with Black voters who might consider voting for a Republican but were turned off because he wouldn’t stand up to Trump.
“Colin Powell can have his picture next to Martin Luther King Jr., Barack Obama and John F. Kennedy in a Black household,” said Mario Morrow Sr., a political consultant in Michigan who has worked for Republican and Democratic governors. “Right now,” he added, “John James won’t get his picture there because he is not standing up.”
James said he hoped to be a kind of “cultural translator” for Black Americans in white, rural and mostly conservative communities where the meaning behind a phrase like Black Lives Matter is often lost.
He explained some of the issues with the phrase “all lives matter,” which some conservatives have used as a retort. It would be similar, he said, to someone hearing that his father had passed away and offering condolences by saying, “Well, everybody’s parents die.”
“A response of ‘all lives matter’ would be truthful,” he said, “but it would also be hurtful and cruel in the moment.”
How often remarks like these will make their way into James’ future ads or campaign speeches is currently a subject of discussion in his campaign. As Michigan slowly emerges from a monthslong shutdown after being hard hit by the coronavirus, James has begun holding in-person events, with masks provided for those who don’t have them. (James himself has worn one at times.)
At one event last week at the home of one of James’ Army friends in the Detroit exurb of Clarkston, a retired state police trooper, Steve Unruh, 49, asked about a fair way to address issues with policing. “Yes, you do have bad cops,” Unruh said. “You got bad doctors, bad lawyers, bad lawn service.”
James was direct. “Your lawn service isn’t a threat to your life,” he said. “When I walked down the street, my gardener isn’t necessarily what I’m thinking about, but I’m thinking about me, and my boys’ lives, very seriously.”
“Stability, unity in leadership,” he added, would help the nation heal. “I have not seen that leadership from our current senator.”
He said nothing of the current president.

NEW YORK — The Seventies called. They want their walls back.
While most New Yorkers grudgingly accepted New York City’s lockdown in March, one community eagerly embraced it: graffiti writers. Deserted commercial streets with gated storefronts offered thousands of blank canvases for quick tags or two-tone throwies, while decorative murals in gentrifying neighborhoods were sprayed over as the streets rendered a definitive critique.
From the South Bronx to East New York, a new generation of graffiti writers has emerged, many of whom have never hit a trainyard or the inside of a subway car. But like early taggers who grew up in a city beset by crime, grime and empty coffers, today’s generation is dealing with its own intense fears over the devastating effects of the coronavirus on communities and the economy.
“Does art dictate the times or do the times dictate art?” said John Matos, 58, a graffiti writer known as Crash who started out in the 1970s. “Before now, the streets were sanitized, with pieces that were cool and nice, and done with permission. Now, we’re back to the roots.”
In his day, tagging was a dangerous — and illegal — art done under cover of night as writers sprayed whole subway cars from top to bottom. To many New Yorkers, it was a hallmark of a city in decline, a view later reinforced by the “broken-windows” approach to policing. Many artists from that era made the shift to gallery exhibits or commercial murals in the mid-1980s, when the city began aggressively targeting what was largely considered vandalism. By 1989, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had declared victory over graffiti (although in recent years some whole cars have been painted clandestinely, leading city officials to step up security).
In the following decades, street art — murals commissioned by landlords and businesses or done by collectives in gentrifying neighborhoods — became trendy as the city experienced an economic and population boom. And while graffiti never disappeared completely, in recent weeks it has become ever more visible citywide. The increase in graffiti is for many residents an unwelcome sign of the recent economic upheaval, especially for property owners who take on the Sisyphean task of trying to erase it all.
“It all begins and ends with angst,” said Matos, 58, the son of an evangelical preacher who grew up in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. “Teenage angst is always going to be provoked. I always equate graffiti with music, like the way Stevie Wonder wrote political songs. What’s going on in the streets is a response to things.”
Today’s pieces are just as bold — and illegal — as those from four decades ago. Henry Chalfant, a co-producer of the 1983 graffiti documentary “Style Wars,” said it’s just part of the landscape for him. He noted that as subway graffiti declined, more artists took to the streets, where they painted without permission.
“It’s more just getting your name out there now,” said Chalfant, who published “Subway Art” with photographer Martha Cooper.
The book is a definitive archive of the ephemeral art.
“Is that really different after the trains were over and the old kings stopped painting? People just went out and bombed,” he said. “And they still are.”
The lockdown — especially when the MTA announced reduced hours — echoed subway graffiti’s heyday some 40 years ago, when artists took advantage of snowstorms that left dozens of unattended trains parked overnight in tunnels. And while wearing a mask may have looked odd six months ago, no one has a second thought about it now, making it easier to paint despite the near-universal presence of surveillance cameras.
Concerns over the virus, as well as the death of George Floyd and others at the hands of the police, have been reflected in the pieces showing up around the city. But a lot of the new tags around town are, on their face, apolitical, although the mere act of writing on a wall is a political statement in itself.
“The whole thing with quarantine is that people feel powerless because daily life and activity is very different,” said Eric Felisbret, the author of “Graffiti New York,” who took up aerosol art as a teenager on the Lower East Side. “They can’t control anything. But they can get out there and bomb — that’s something they can control.”
EASY, who started out on the trains in 1982, has gone out tagging about five times alone or with friends during the lockdown. He prefers to travel by train and foot, most recently having put up a number of quick tags along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn at night. While pedestrians were scarce, the police were not. At one point he threw down his spray can and rummaged through a nearby garbage can as a squad car approached.
Compared with previous decades, however, the streets felt safer, he said.
“During the ’80s it was very dangerous,” said EASY, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It wasn’t a big thing if you wrote graffiti on a train. But when you went to some neighborhoods, people might think what you wrote on the street was a code to put someone in bodily danger. You could be mistaken for someone sending a message and get shot.”
Some of what can be seen today covers a range of styles, from simple, kinetic tags that look like an electrocardiogram, to large bubble letters with thick outlines and shiny or white fill-ins. Some honor past influences, like a buxom figure showing up recently in the South Bronx that is reminiscent of Vaughn Bode’s classic 1970s underground comic illustrations, which influenced earlier generations.
In the 1970s, police officers staked out hardware stores where young graffiti writers “racked” (shoplifted) spray paint and taught one another by sharing black notebooks filled with designs. Today, the paint can be ordered online. And rather than compare designs with others at the famed Writer’s Bench at the 149th Street-Grand Concourse subway station, archives of work and how-to videos are easily found online.
“Some of these names are hard to keep up with,” Felisbret said. “But there are also a few vets up in there, too. Face it, for a writer, seeing those gates down is sweet.”

The Manhattan district attorney’s decision to charge a white woman with filing a false police report against a Black man in Central Park does not have the support of one key person: the victim himself.
The man, Christian Cooper, has not cooperated with the prosecution’s investigation. The woman, Amy Cooper, lost her job and was publicly shamed after a video Christian Cooper made on May 25 was posted online; it showed her calling 911 to claim an “African American man” was threatening her. Those consequences alone, Christian Cooper said at the time, were in his view perhaps too much punishment.
“On the one hand, she’s already paid a steep price,” Christian Cooper said in a statement on Tuesday. “That’s not enough of a deterrent to others? Bringing her more misery just seems like piling on.” But he added that he understood there was a greater principle at stake and that this should be defended. “So if the DA feels the need to pursue charges, he should pursue charges. But he can do that without me.”
Christian Cooper’s decision not to cooperate may present some challenges for prosecutors. But it also reflects a wider debate among people who generally consider themselves allies in the growing movement to call attention to and fight racism, not just in policing, but in society.
The announcement that she will now be prosecuted has drawn mixed reactions from Black community leaders and advocates for overhauling the criminal justice system.
Amy Cooper’s 911 call was seen by many as a clear example of everyday racism and fueled outrage over the dangers associated with making false reports to the police about Black people.
Some social justice advocates said that Amy Cooper’s case should serve as a warning to others who might seek to wrongfully use the police in a racially charged encounter. But some argued that charging her criminally reinforces the idea that the only just consequence for wrongdoing should be incarceration.
For instance, Josie Duffy Rice, the president of the The Appeal, a nonprofit website, said that bringing criminal charges against Amy Cooper legitimizes a criminal justice system that she considers to be flawed and racist.
“Ask yourself what criminal charges can do to Amy Cooper that hasn’t already been done?” Duffy Rice wrote in a tweet, without capitalization and missing some punctuation. “Has she not faced consequences? She did something absolutely horrible and she lost her job, her dog, her personal business was on the front page of the paper.”
The incident on Memorial Day weekend began when Christian Cooper, an avid birder, was looking for birds in a wild part of the park known as the Ramble, and encountered Amy Cooper as she walked with her dog off the leash.
He asked her to leash the dog. She refused and he began filming. Amy Cooper said she would tell the police that “an African-American man is threatening my life” before dialing 911.
The video of the encounter went viral on Twitter and garnered more than 40 million views.
On Monday, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., announced plans to charge Amy Cooper with falsely reporting the confrontation, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of a year behind bars. If convicted, however, she is likely to receive a conditional discharge or be sentenced to community service or counseling. She was ordered to appear in court on Oct. 14.
Amy Cooper’s attorney, Robert Barnes, has said his client would fight the charge.
Vance’s decision received praise in some quarters.
“Her racist behavior could have had dire consequences for a Black man,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. “Glad she’ll face consequences of her own.”
Others pointed out that Amy Cooper’s actions might have had dire consequences and she should be held responsible, regardless of Christian Cooper’s sympathy for her plight.
“If the police believed she was really being attacked, they could have come in with guns drawn and she would have been the only witness in this — outside of that video that may or may not have surfaced,” said Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, a professor of constitutional law at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “This isn’t just about Christian Cooper. The community has been harmed by the actions of Amy Cooper and, in order to rectify this, then the people of New York need to have their day in court, even if Christian Cooper is a reluctant witness.”
Browne-Marshall said the case was only the latest example in a long history of incidents in which white people have summoned the police and falsely accused a Black person of a crime. Others have compared the case to the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till.
The video of the incident captured on Christian Cooper’s phone shows Amy Cooper with a tight grip on her dog’s collar. She says to a 911 operator in a high, frantic voice: “I’m in the Ramble, there is a man, African-American. He has a bicycle helmet and he is recording me and threatening me and my dog.”
Before ending the call, she adds, “I am being threatened by a man in the Ramble, please send the cops immediately!”
Christian Cooper said in a Facebook post that after the woman refused to leash her dog, he had decided to offer the dog treats in an effort to convince her to abide by the leash law.
“Look, if you’re going to do what you want, I’m going to do what I want, but you’re not going to like it,” he told her, before he pulled out the treats and began filming, according to his post.
Alvin Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School, said the video provides sufficient evidence for the prosecution, and that her focus on his race suggests she intended to file a false report, a necessary element to prove a crime.
“There is a false weepy tone and she strategically placed significance on race,” Bragg said. “She is harping on deep historical issues in our country. She is emphasizing those words and she knows the effect it can have on the listener.”
To prevail at trial, prosecutors will have to prove that Amy Cooper did not believe in that moment she was being threatened and that she intended to file a false complaint against him, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan.
“A threat can be, ‘I’m going to kill you,’ or it can be subtle,” Alonso said. “She may well have believed at the time that his statement was threatening in her definition.”
But Marc Lamont Hill, a media studies professor at Temple University who supports defunding police departments, said the case has forced some advocates who want change the criminal justice system to reimagine how justice might be served in this instance. “We can’t criminalize our way out of social problems,” he said.
Hill expressed doubt that Amy Cooper’s prosecution might stop other similar incidents. He also said that it might send the wrong message to victims of rape or domestic violence who, after complaining to police, decide not to cooperate with prosecutors and might fear being charged with filing a false report.
City Councilman Donovan J. Richards, D-Queens, who chairs the public safety committee, said that he was not overjoyed to hear that charges had been brought against Amy Cooper. For him, the matter was complicated.
“I don’t think any of us are celebrating the fact that she was arrested,” said Richards, who is Black. “I’m hoping at the end of the day she learned her lesson and that this is a teachable moment for folks — that they can’t just call 911 and put people’s lives in danger just because their privilege is being checked.”

Why the Stakes Are So High in New Jersey's Primary This Year [With graphic(s)]

New Jersey voters will decide dozens of primary races by Tuesday, including closely watched showdowns among candidates hoping to take on two vulnerable freshman congressmen: Jeff Van Drew, a party-swapping Republican, and Andy Kim, a Democrat in a swing district.
But the primary was also drawing attention because of something that had never happened before in New Jersey: Almost all of the voting was being done by mail, with ballots that had to be postmarked by Tuesday.
As in other states, the coronavirus pandemic has upended the way New Jersey is holding its primary this year. Only about half of the state’s polling sites are open for the filing of provisional ballots, which are expected to be used by a small number of people.
Voters can also deliver ballots that were mailed to their homes more than a month ago to drop boxes set up in each county.
The results of the closest races will probably not be clear for at least a week as the ballots trickle in, making Election Day as much a referendum on the voting method as on the candidates who are running.
Gov. Philip D. Murphy has said he was watching to see how the voting went before determining how broadly to rely on mailed ballots for the presidential election in November, where the stakes will be much higher.
“We’re going to be watching very closely for any shenanigans that we hear about,” Murphy, a Democrat, said Monday. “Any voter suppression. Anybody that’s trying to job the system.”
In states like Washington that have long embraced voting by mail, there has been no evidence that it leads to widespread fraud. That has not dulled sharp attacks by President Donald Trump, who has made dozens of false claims about the process and had predicted that it would result in “the most corrupt election in the history of our country.”
In the midst of the pandemic, there was nothing normal about how candidates have campaigned. And Election Day itself veered sharply from the typical script.
There were no perfunctory photographs of candidates casting votes with their spouses and no insider buzz around victory parties or early poll results. Get-out-the-vote efforts began weeks ago, as campaigns were able to check on who had returned ballots and who had not.
Those who had not were targeted by telephone and text.
Hector Oseguera, 32, a lawyer who is challenging Rep. Albio Sires in a Democratic primary in northern New Jersey, said his campaign had planned to send 500,000 text messages to voters in the two weeks before Election Day, with a goal of contacting each voter four or five times.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, 45, who is in a Democratic primary battle with Arati S. Kreibich, a neuroscientist and former council member in Glen Rock, said that his campaign had made more than 525,000 get-out-the-vote phone calls and had sent 220,000 texts.
The reliance on texting and calls is a departure from typical New Jersey elections, where campaigns work to mobilize and sometimes even drive voters to the polls.
Employees at election boards in New Jersey’s 21 counties were also in uncharted territory, having to confirm signatures on ballots while also tallying votes.
“This can serve as a test run for November,” said John Froonjian, the executive director of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University. “New Jersey has to be prepared to learn from what happens today and the next few days.”
Froonjian moderated a three-way online debate last month between some of the Democrats competing to run against Van Drew, who was elected as a Democrat and joined the Republican Party in December after voting against Trump’s impeachment.
Van Drew’s campaign to win reelection will be one of the most-watched congressional races this year, and the Democratic primary to choose the candidate who will try to unseat him quickly turned toxic.
The race pits Amy Kennedy, a former middle school history teacher and mental health advocate who is married to a member of a Democratic political dynasty, against Brigid Callahan Harrison, a college professor who won the early support of South Jersey’s political power brokers.
Cricket Cohen, 71, who owns a horse farm in Atlantic County, where more than a third of the district’s voters live, recently planted a campaign lawn sign in support of a third Democratic challenger, Will Cunningham, 34.
Cohen said she was turned off by Kennedy’s and Harrison’s alliances with established party politicians. Kennedy, who is backed by Murphy, is married to Patrick J. Kennedy, a former congressman and a son of the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
A lifelong Democrat, Cohen said she had voted in 2018 for Van Drew, who she believes is vulnerable, even in a district where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 5 percentage points.
“More people are disillusioned with Van Drew than I thought would be,” she said.
A Republican primary in a nearby South Jersey congressional district has also had its share of intrigue. A former business executive, David Richter, 54, who initially planned to challenge Van Drew in a general election as a Republican, switched districts after Van Drew switched parties.
He is facing a former elected county official, Kate Gibbs, who is 20 years younger. As a woman, Gibbs could appeal to female voters — a coveted group for Republicans hoping to expand their reach in New Jersey.
The winner will take on Kim, who narrowly won election in 2018 after a drawn-out campaign against a key ally of Trump’s.
Farther north, in New Brunswick, another young woman, Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, is trying to shake up the status quo in a Democratic primary against Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a 16-term incumbent who is seeking reelection.
Al-Khatahtbeh, a founder of MuslimGirl.com, a blog for Muslim women, said she decided to enter the race amid the renewed focus on policing and racism that swept the nation in the aftermath of the killing in police custody of George Floyd. She said she had gotten a telephone death threat since entering the race, which she taped and shared on Twitter.
“This campaign is much larger than me as a candidate,” Al-Khatahtbeh, 28, said. “This is our generation stepping up and taking on the leadership that has failed us since we were children.”

When Chris and Shanelle Montana founded Du Nord Craft Spirits in 2013, they chose the Longfellow neighborhood in southern Minneapolis, “in part because it was a little quieter,” Chris Montana said.
It didn’t work out that way. Over the past four months, Du Nord has been buffeted and transformed by each new trauma to shake the city, and the world.
In mid-March, with the coronavirus converging on the United States, the couple, like many other distillers, ceased making their gin, vodka, whiskey and liqueurs, and began manufacturing much-needed hand sanitizer.
Chris Montana handed out that sanitizer to protesters outside the nearby 3rd Precinct police station after the killing of George Floyd on May 25. The distiller was tear-gassed twice for his trouble.
In the early hours of May 29, Du Nord, like many businesses in the neighborhood, was in flames. The fire activated its sprinkler system, which added water damage to the devastation. The night after that, the Montanas’ East Lake Street apartment building was set on fire.
No sooner had Du Nord begun to clean up than Chris Montana quickly pivoted, converting what was left of the building, where he leases space, into an impromptu food bank to aid the reeling neighborhood.
“I think one of the things that has made it easier personally is there’s just so much to do,” said Montana, 37. “You don’t really have time to sit down and soak it all in. I might be bummed because some people set fire to my distillery. That saddens me and angered me. But right now, I have food every night. I’m fine. There are people doing so much worse than I am.”
Du Nord’s experience is all the more remarkable in the current cultural context because Chris Montana is one of the few Black distillery owners in the United States.
During the protests and ensuing unrest that engulfed much of East Lake Street, he had to weigh his instincts as a business owner against the dangers that might await him outside. When he heard at 2 a.m. on May 29 that his distillery was on fire, he did not rush to the site but waited until daybreak.
“That was very scary,” said Shanelle Montana, 36, “the thought of his going back to a burning distillery when the police walk by. Are they going to think he’s a distillery owner mourning his distillery?”
Although the Montanas, who have three young children, have enough to contend with on their own, their focus has been helping the community. The food bank in the distillery has paused while critical repairs are made to the waterlogged building, but Du Nord is likely to reopen it, based on community need in the coming months.
When friends started GoFundMe accounts for them, the couple’s reaction was to answer those efforts with a fundraising drive of their own to help other businesses in the area owned by people of color.
“I knew a lot of them were uninsured or underinsured,” Chris Montana said.
The Du Nord Craft Spirits Riot Recovery Fund, administered by the newly created nonprofit Du Nord Foundation, has since raised roughly two-thirds of its $1 million goal.
“We’re hoping that within the next two weeks, we’re going to start writing checks,” said Chris Montana, who hopes to get back to producing spirits by the fall.
This generosity in the face of personal adversity has not surprised the couple’s friends and colleagues.
“He’s always making the best of whatever situation is handed to him,” said Jon Kreidler, a co-founder of Tattersall Distilling, a Minneapolis company that teamed with Du Nord on sanitizer production.
“Chris and Shanelle would never turn down an opportunity to serve the community,” said Jessica Ward-Denison, an organizer of the food bank. “With the scariness and sadness of the days leading up to this, I think there was a great need for something positive.”
Shanelle Montana, who is white, took more time getting to that positive place.
”I was very angry for a long time,” she said of the destruction. “A lot that were hit were small mom-and-pop businesses by people of color that had been in business for a long time.
“But as I talked to people, a lot of them said, ‘If this is what it takes to change things, then this is what it takes.’ It really changed my perspective. I got there. It took me longer, but I got there, to see the hope in this and to separate the damage from the change it might bring.”
Chris Montana benefited from a broader view, informed by his childhood. Soon after his family moved to Minnesota from Indiana, in 1991, he recalled a rally and chants of “No justice, no peace.”
“Then, it was about Rodney King,” he said. “It occurred to me that here we are, almost 30 years on, the chants are the same, the problems are the same.”
This time, though, he senses a shift.
“I don’t condone the property damage, but I do understand it,” Montana said. “If that means there’s going to be attention paid to this fundamental issue in our country, then it’s worth it. I don’t know if there’s a person of color in this country that, whether they own the business or not, who would not pay that price over and over again.”

New Jersey and Delaware are holding primary elections Tuesday, with a presidential primary in Delaware and multiple congressional primaries across New Jersey.
Both states are conducting their primaries largely by mail. New Jersey has mailed ballots to the state’s 2.3 million registered Democrats and 1.3 million Republicans, and ballot applications to 2.4 million unaffiliated registered voters. (Primaries in New Jersey are “closed,” meaning that a voter has to be a registered member of a party to vote.)
It is unlikely that official results in New Jersey will be known for at least a week, as mail-in ballots must be postmarked by 8 p.m. on election day. As of Monday, election officials had received just under 1 million ballots, according to the secretary of state in New Jersey.
Here’s what to watch for:
The race to take on a Democratic-turned-Republican congressman is closely watched.
For Democrats in New Jersey and across the country, Rep. Jeff Van Drew’s switch to the Republican Party in December, after the impeachment vote against President Donald Trump, was nothing short of a betrayal. Potential opponents began quickly jockeying to take on Van Drew in what will be one of November’s most watched congressional races.
But the primary battle in South Jersey has turned toxic, fracturing the state’s Democratic establishment along lines both familiar and foreign to those who closely follow the political machinations of Trenton.
Backing Amy Kennedy, a mental health advocate and former teacher who is part of the Kennedy political diaspora, is Gov. Philip Murphy, along with progressive activists and labor unions who often side with him.
With Murphy supporting Kennedy, it is unsurprising to Trenton insiders that her opponent, Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor at Montclair State University, has the backing of two fellow Democrats who are often at odds with the governor: Stephen M. Sweeney, the state Senate president, and George E. Norcross, the South Jersey power broker.
But Callahan also has the support of Sens. Robert Menendez and Cory Booker, the popular junior senator who is up for reelection. He is “bracketing” Harrison on the ballot, meaning they both will be listed in the same column.
The race has been marked less by the racial justice movement that has shaped recent races in other states and more by local issues, namely infrastructure and economic needs along the Jersey Shore, health care reform and marijuana legalization.
Progressives challenge two incumbents in northern New Jersey.
Whether in New York or Kentucky, voters seemed primed to welcome new, diverse candidates after a month of protests over the May 25 killing of George Floyd after an encounter with police in Minneapolis. In New Jersey, two progressive challengers have mounted aggressive campaigns against two moderate Democrats in the northern part of the state.
Arati S. Kreibich, 45, a neuroscientist, is challenging Rep. Josh Gottheimer, one of the few Democrats in the country who flipped a congressional seat in the 2016 election. Kreibich has received the endorsement of national progressive leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been sending text messages to his presidential campaign lists in support of Kreibich.
But Gottheimer, who has the backing of national Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and is one of the most prolific fundraisers in the Democratic caucus, has turned back close challenges before.
And Rep. Albio Sires, who has been in Congress since 2007, is facing a stiff challenge from a 32-year-old lawyer, Hector Oseguera, who has been a fixture at recent Black Lives Matter rallies and protests. Sires, who has long enjoyed the support of the powerful northern New Jersey political machine, has been campaigning more aggressively over the past few weeks.
A Republican is pushed north by Van Drew.
Before the impeachment vote, David Richter, considered a rising star within the Republican Party, was seen as the front-runner to take on Van Drew, who at that time was a freshman Democrat in a swing district.
But once Van Drew defected and earned the endorsement of Trump, Richter looked elsewhere.
One district north, in fact. He faces Kate Gibbs in a Republican primary in New Jersey’s 3rd Congressional District, which was flipped by a Democrat in 2018 when Andy Kim upset the incumbent, Tom MacArthur, in what had long been a Republican stronghold.
Vote-by-mail struggles to take off.
New Jersey’s first run through an expanded vote-by-mail election — held in May for multiple municipal races — was rocky at best. Ten percent of ballots were rejected over issues with signatures not matching, according to a study by the online news service NJ Spotlight.
The state attorney general also charged four men with election fraud stemming from the municipal elections in Paterson, the third-largest city in the state. There, county officials rejected nearly 20% of the ballots.
A district court in New Jersey ruled last month that voters whose ballots were rejected because of issues with a signature must be notified and given the opportunity to address the problem.
A design flaw in the July ballots also caused U.S. Postal Service scanners to mark completed absentee ballots mailed back to election offices as “return to sender.” State officials said they were unsure of how many ballots were affected.
Since the state proactively mailed ballots and ballot applications, New Jersey is allowing only provisional voting at in-person locations. Although election officials do not expect there to be many long lines like those seen in states like Georgia, provisional ballots do take longer to fill out, which may lead to some longer waits across the state.

There will be blood tests. Interrogations about junior high. An analysis of tax returns.
It is an experience Joe Biden knows all too well from his time on the vice presidential short list 12 years ago.
Much about Biden’s own search for a running mate has been nontraditional. He has publicly mused about his criteria. He is not considering men. Above all, his choice could be the most important in years: At 77, Biden has said he views himself as a “transition candidate.” Left unsaid: His vice president could very well end up being the president next.
Yet as much as Biden’s process is unique, its contours are familiar. Late last month, he told a local television station that his campaign had begun “doing the background checks” — the latest sign that he is moving toward a short list of candidates.
If history is a guide, Biden’s top contenders should expect to submit themselves to a process that veterans liken to a series of graphic medical procedures. Extraneous? Maybe. But, well, sometimes that’s the vice presidency, too.
“They basically are disassembling your entire life,” said Kathleen Sebelius, a former Democratic governor of Kansas who, along with Biden, was vetted extensively by the Obama campaign in 2008. “It was as intrusive and probing as anything I’ve ever been through or would hope to ever go through again.”
Evan Bayh, a former Democratic senator from Indiana and a repeat vice presidential contestant, somewhat famously compared the vetting process to a colonoscopy — “except they use the Hubble telescope on you.”
Indeed, when Barack Obama called Biden in June 2008 to request permission to vet him, Biden initially said no. Finally, he wrote in his 2017 memoir, “I agreed to go through the vetting process, but not with a whole lot of enthusiasm.”
Sebelius said Obama had called her when she was at a hotel for a meeting. Like Biden, she tried to persuade him not to vet her. “I spent a little bit of time telling him why that was a terrible idea,” she recalled. He was undeterred: A member of his vetting team was waiting to speak to her in a room downstairs.
One of the cardinal rules of the process is secrecy, and nearly everyone obeys. Most potential running mates do not speak about the search, if they acknowledge they are being vetted at all. Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska senator who was vetted by Bill Clinton in 1992, said he flew on a friend’s private plane to the governor’s mansion in Little Rock, Arkansas, for a meeting so almost no one would know where he was.
Presidential candidates consider many factors when selecting their running mates. They are not always political. Kerrey, for instance, said he suspected early on he wasn’t getting the job. For one, he wasn’t married at the time, and he worried that the optics in a photograph would be off.
“You need to have Bill and Hillary and somebody and somebody,” Kerrey said. “You don’t want Bill and Hillary and Bob.”
Vetting procedures have become increasingly rigorous, in part because campaigns are wary of what can happen if details are overlooked. More recently, the availability of potentially incriminating details on the internet has made vetting seem more imperative than ever, lest anyone dig up a surprise. (Of course, the election of President Donald Trump showed that voters might also shrug off what might once have been disqualifying information.)
Tim Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor, recalled scrambling with his wife, Mary, in 2008 to provide all the information John McCain requested as part of his vetting.
“At one point during the process, our entire living room was covered with documents as Mary and I organized them, typed up answers to the lengthy questionnaire and organized it all into 3-ring binders,” he said in an email. They stayed up late and subsisted on pizza as they raced to meet the campaign’s deadlines.
Julián Castro, whom Hillary Clinton vetted extensively in 2016, said her campaign had given him a survey seeking answers to more than 120 questions about his personal, political and financial history.
At one point during the interview to go over the responses, one of the questioners spotted Castro’s cellphone. What would the questioner find, he asked, if he were to take Castro’s phone and go through it right now? (No, Castro did not provide the answer to The New York Times.)
“You recognize the gravity of this process,” he said. “But it still has this spy thriller, cloak-and-dagger aspect to it all.”
With the global pandemic sidelining much of Biden’s in-person presidential campaign, his veepstakes has become a welcome throwback to normal post-primary political activity.
Already, one of Biden’s top contenders, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has formally withdrawn from contention. In an interview with MSNBC last month, she referred to the calls for racial justice that have swept the country since the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police, saying she believed “that this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket.”
Faux modesty is also part of the game: Everyone whose name is on a list almost always declares themselves honored just to be thought of at all. When Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada said in May she was withdrawing from consideration, she said that it was “an honor to be considered” but that she wanted to keep her focus on her home state.
A brief survey of short-listed names over the years reveals some perennial participants. Pawlenty, for instance, was vetted by both McCain and Mitt Romney. Bayh was seriously considered by Al Gore and Obama.
Biden has also at times mentioned some familiar names, including Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who was one of Gore’s finalists. (Shaheen, however, reportedly told Biden she was not interested in serving as his vice president.) But his pledge to choose a woman has eliminated most of the usual names from contention.
Obama called Biden to tell him he had gotten the job as Biden was waiting at a dentist's office while his wife, Jill, was having a root canal. Despite Biden’s reluctance just weeks earlier, he was delighted. “I accepted without hesitation,” Biden said. “It felt good to say yes.”
But as it most often does, the process for most of Biden’s prospects will likely end in disappointment — and possibly some relief.
James Stavridis, a retired admiral who was vetted by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, said it had been so intrusive and secretive that he jokingly told a friend, former CIA spokesman Bill Harlow, that he hoped he was really providing all the information to the Clinton campaign and not Russian intelligence.
When he was not chosen, he and Harlow decided to write a “humorous novel about the Russians penetrating the U.S. VP selection process.” In the proposal for the book, called “The Veepstakes,” they described the tone as “stylistically, an ‘entertainment’ a la Chris Buckley or Elmore Leonard.”
The proposal was widely rejected, Stavridis said. The premise was too implausible.
Castro professed to being disappointed when Hillary Clinton ultimately selected Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia but said he was “glad that all of that speculation was over.”
The experience also came with an unexpected benefit. As part of his vetting, Castro had to get a blood test, forcing him to confront a phobia he had harbored since he was a young child.
“The best thing was that I had to get over that fear,” he said. “It certainly wasn’t that I got the job, because I didn’t.”

Las comunidades latinas respaldan con entusiasmo las protestas de Black Lives Matter, al tiempo que ejercen presión para que se reconozca el racismo sistémico que también enfrentan.
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times.
PHOENIX — “Tu lucha es mi lucha”, rezaban en español varios carteles en una reciente protesta de Black Lives Matter cerca del Capitolio del Estado de Arizona. Tu lucha es mi lucha. El mar de rostros incluía a jóvenes latinos que habían marchado antes, durante el movimiento de derechos de los inmigrantes en el estado hace una década, cuando Joe Arpaio defendió políticas draconianas como el alguacil del condado de Maricopa. No había dudas en la mente de estos manifestantes: sus luchas contra el racismo están unidas.
“ Black and brown ” ha sido un lema en la política de los demócratas y en los círculos de activistas liberales durante años, al imaginar a los dos grupos minoritarios como una coalición tanto con poder electoral como con una serie de preocupaciones compartidas sobre igualidad salarial, justicia penal, acceso a la atención médica y otros temas. Las protestas en curso sobre la violencia policial y el racismo sistémico también abarcan a ambas comunidades, pero la atención nacional se ha dirigido principalmente al impacto sobre los estadounideses negros y a las formas en que los estadounidenses blancos responden a ello.
Muchos votantes y activistas latinos liberales, a su vez, están tratando de averiguar dónde encajan en la conversación nacional sobre discriminación racial y étnica. Tienen problemas e historias particulares que pueden ser ocultados por el amplio marco de “ black and brown ” o eclipsados por las injusticias que enfrentan los afroestadounidenses. Para algunos, también hay que lidiar con una historia de racismo antinegro en su propia comunidad y la falta de inclusión de los afrolatinos, que representan el 25 por ciento de los latinos en Estados Unidos.
Y aunque los latinos quieren que la gente entienda cómo los afecta el racismo sistémico en la educación, la vivienda y la riqueza, también están lidiando con una suposición arraigada de que el racismo es un problema en blanco y negro, lo que puede dificultar que el tema se afiance en la conversación nacional.
A menudo se encuentran frustrados e implícitamente excluidos.
“Nos hacen sentir unos indeseables sin importar lo que hayamos hecho o cuánto tiempo hemos estado aquí”, dijo Cynthia García, de 28 años, quien asistió a la manifestación y cuyos padres emigraron de México. Cuando era niña en Phoenix, dijo, escuchaba regularmente insultos racistas dirigidos a su familia y ahora escucha las mismas palabras utilizadas contra sus propios hijos en edad escolar. Dijo que era importante marchar, tanto para “aparecer por nosotros mismos como para decir que esto está mal”.
Las conversaciones sobre raza que buscan propiciar los latinos se desarrollan en un momento en que las preocupaciones urgentes sobre salud, vigilancia e inmigración están en colisión. También se llevan a cabo antes de una elección en la cual se espera que los latinos sean el bloque de votación más grande exceptuando a los blancos y que puedan resultar críticos en estados decisivos como Arizona, Florida y Carolina del Norte.
La pandemia del coronavirus ha afectado a las comunidades latinas en tasas desproporcionadamente altas, en parte porque muchos son considerados trabajadores esenciales en campos agrícolas, plantas empacadoras de carne, restaurantes y hospitales de todo el país.
Y a medida que estallaron las protestas en todo Estados Unidos por los asesinatos policiales de personas negras, dos casos que involucraron a hombres latinos provocaron nuevas protestas la semana pasada: un guardia de seguridad de 18 años fue asesinado a tiros por ayudantes del alguacil de Los Ángeles y, en Tucson, las imágenes recién publicadas de la cámara corporal de unos agentes muestran a un hombre que muere esposado, suplicándoles por agua.
Por décadas, los latinos se han indignado ante las tácticas policiales agresivas, incluso a manos de agentes latinos. En los últimos años, cientos de latinos, en su mayoría hombres, han sido asesinados por la policía en California, Arizona y Nuevo México, entre otros estados, aunque las estadísticas nacionales son difíciles de obtener. Ahora, los activistas están presionando para que haya un debate más explícito sobre la excesiva vigilancia que se ejerce sobre las comunidades latinas.
“Siempre hemos sabido que la brutalidad policial es un problema negro y de otras comunidades de color, un problema de la gente pobre”, dice Marisa Franco, directora ejecutiva de Mijente, un grupo latino de derechos civiles.
“Ahora mismo es imperativo que las comunidades latinas no negras se identifiquen con las personas negras y también reconozcan que es de nuestro interés material cambiar fundamentalmente la policía en este país”, dijo Franco.
En Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Atlanta, Filadelfia y muchas otras ciudades, miles de jóvenes latinos se han presentado a las protestas de Black Lives Matter en las últimas semanas. Algunas veces, hablan solo discretamente sobre sus propias preocupaciones de racismo antilatino.
Otras veces son más abiertos. En Phoenix, los activistas llevaban máscaras con la leyenda “Defund Police”, con las tres últimas letras marcadas en rojo para enfatizar ICE, la sigla en inglés del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas. Un artista hizo circular una pintura de estilo azteca serigrafiada que mostraba a un jaguar negro y a un tigre marrón, cada uno mezclado con el otro, su propio simbolismo del momento.
La semana pasada, la policía en Tempe, Arizona, aprobó un acuerdo de dos millones de dólares con la familia de Antonio Arce, un niño de 14 años que recibió un disparo en la espalda y fue asesinado por un agente de policía en enero de 2019. Los activistas de derechos de los inmigrantes señalan con frecuencia el hecho de que los departamentos de policía a menudo están a cargo de la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, lo que deja a muchos latinos aterrorizados de llamar a la policía por temor a una posible deportación.
El miedo y la indignación han sido especialmente agudos en la era del presidente Donald Trump, quien hace cinco años anunció su candidatura mientras llamaba a los mexicanos violadores y criminales. El sospechoso del ataque más mortal perpetrado en contra de los latinos en la historia moderna de Estados Unidos, el año pasado en El Paso, usó un lenguaje similar en su manifiesto.
Antes de votar a favor de un paquete demócrata de revisión policial en el congreso la semana pasada, el representante Joaquin Castro habló de Hector Santoscoy, un mexicano que fue asesinado por un agente de policía de San Antonio en 1980.
“No hay duda de que la comunidad afroestadounidense ha sufrido la mayor parte de la brutalidad policial, pero también es claro que los latinos también han sufrido”, dijo Castro en una entrevista. “Existe un parentesco de experiencia como comunidad”.
Sin embargo, aclarar y abordar la discriminación que enfrentan los latinos sigue siendo un reto, dijo Castro. Si bien muchos estadounidenses aprenden la historia básica de la esclavitud y el racismo de Jim Crow contra los negros, sigue habiendo una falta de conocimiento fundamental sobre la historia de los latinos que puede dificultar el debate sobre cómo las políticas sociales han sido perjudiciales.
“Muchos estadounidenses no saben exactamente dónde encajas”, dice Castro.
En conversaciones con sus tres hijos sobre raza, Alma Aguilar, de 31 años, ha sido clara sobre su propia experiencia: “No nos tratan de la misma manera que a los blancos”, les dice.
“La gente tiende a atacarnos”, dice Aguilar, quien asistió a una pequeña protesta cerca de su casa en los suburbios de Phoenix. “Cuando mi hijo crezca, no quiero que un agente de policía lo mate porque se ve de cierta manera, porque es un niño moreno”.
Incluso el término brown (en español “marrón” o “café”) puede simplificar demasiado las cosas, dado que a menudo se usa para describir a personas de múltiples continentes y diferentes culturas, cuyo color de piel puede variar de marfil a siena. También puede usarse en referencia a personas originarias del Medio Oriente o el sur de Asia. Y lejos de ser un monolito, los latinos incluyen a inmigrantes indocumentados y a aquellos cuyas familias han estado en Estados Unidos durante siglos.
En un momento en que Trump ha hecho de su lenguaje y políticas antiinmigrantes una pieza central de su gobierno, muchos latinos —y quizás especialmente los jóvenes— se ven a sí mismos como parte de una lucha más amplia por la igualdad racial. “Muchos jóvenes latinos están haciendo la conexión, presionan a sus familias a sostener conversaciones difíciles”, dijo Chris Zepeda-Millán, profesor de estudios Chicanos y políticas públicas en la Universidad de California, Los Ángeles.
En una indicación de que los latinos están reaccionando al momento actual con urgencia, una encuesta reciente de The New York Times y Siena College encontró que el 21 por ciento de los votantes hispanos dijeron que habían participado en las protestas de Black Lives Matter, un porcentaje casi idéntico al 22 por ciento de votantes negros que dijeron que lo había hecho.
Jonathan Jayes-Green, un activista de toda la vida que en 2015 creó UndocuBlack, una organización diseñada para llamar la atención sobre temas de inmigración y justicia racial, dijo que había visto un cambio notable entre los latinos, tanto en su deseo de protestar como en su disposición a enfrentar el racismo entre ellos.
Ese activismo quedó a la vista cuando decenas de líderes políticos latinos firmaron recientemente una carta abierta pidiendo a Univision y Telemundo, las redes de noticias en español más grandes con sede en Estados Unidos, que mejoren su cobertura de las protestas y que “usen sus plataformas para desmantelar el racismo, el colorismo y la antinegritud en nuestra propia comunidad latina”. Mijente hizo circular una petición similar.
La antinegritud tiene raíces profundas y complicadas en toda América Latina, donde las personas de piel clara son vistas con frecuencia como el ideal y reciben un mejor tratamiento. Y esas opiniones a menudo se han trasladado a Estados Unidos, donde algunos creen que la asimilación es el camino hacia la igualdad.
“Históricamente hemos tendido a aspirar al sueño americano, a aspirar a la blancura”, dijo Jayes-Green, quien es afrolatino. “Los latinos tienen un papel realmente activo en esta lucha. Podemos demostrar que estas luchas no están separadas y que podemos ser conspiradores activos en las luchas contra la antinegritud”.
Muchos activistas latinos liberales han estado presionando a favor de grandes transformaciones policiales durante años, en particular en los grandes centros urbanos. Muchas grandes ciudades de Estados Unidos tienen en su historia coaliciones de grupos comunitarios negros y latinos que luchan por la reforma policial, aunque con éxito desigual.
“La policía siempre ha representado a esta fuerza externa que podría dañarnos”, explicó Rafael Návar, quien dijo que fue maltratado por el Departamento del Alguacil del condado de Los Ángeles cuando era adolescente.
Pero la policía, señaló Návar, es solo una parte de la lucha de los latinos, que representan aproximadamente el 18 por ciento de la población de Estados Unidos.
“Este es un gran momento para expandir la conciencia alrededor de nuestra propia comunidad, para reconocer la contradicción de qué tipo de poder tenemos y no tenemos en este país, que a pesar de nuestro tamaño, ni siquiera tenemos las necesidades básicas cubiertas”, dijo Návar. “Este país no come sin nuestra comunidad, y, sin embargo, las personas que hacen el trabajo no pueden mantener a salvo a su propia familia. La falta de poder tiene que hacer que nos preguntemos: ¿Qué tipo de respeto tenemos? ¿Cómo nos organizamos para tener dignidad?”.
Igual que varios de sus amigos y primos, Víctor Ortíz, de 22 años, asistió a las protestas todos los días durante más de dos semanas. Muchos de sus padres están trabajando en oficios que los obligan a salir de sus hogares durante la pandemia.
“Entonces, de cualquier manera, tu familia está en riesgo”, dijo. “Es lo mismo para los negros, lo sabemos. Tenemos que estar ahí los unos para los otros”.
Los latinos apenas tienen el tipo de infraestructura política profunda que los afroestadounidenses han construido durante décadas, con muchas organizaciones que trabajan a favor de objetivos similares. Muchos activistas latinos liberales ven el movimiento Black Lives Matter, y la ola actual de protestas, como un modelo.
Ysenia Lechuga, de 28 años, una esteticista de Phoenix que llevó un letrero de “tu lucha es mi lucha” a varias manifestaciones recientes, dijo que encontraba al activismo negro “inspirador”.
“Puedo venir aquí y predicar sobre los inmigrantes y todos los problemas que enfrentamos”, dijo Lechuga sobre su asistencia a las protestas de Black Lives Matter. “Nos perfilan racialmente, nos golpean”.
Ella piensa que el movimiento actual tendrá un “efecto dominó” que también llegará a su comunidad, dijo. “Todo va a comenzar a cambiar”.

PHOENIX — “Tu lucha es mi lucha,” several signs declared at a recent Black Lives Matter protest near the Arizona State Capitol. Your struggle is my struggle. The sea of faces included young Latinos who had marched before, during the immigrant rights movement in the state a decade ago, when Joe Arpaio championed draconian policies as the sheriff of Maricopa County. There was no doubt in these protesters’ minds: Their fights against racism are bound up together.
“Black and brown” has been a catchphrase in Democratic politics and progressive activist circles for years, envisioning the two minority groups as a coalition with both electoral power and an array of shared concerns about pay equity, criminal justice, access to health care and other issues. The ongoing protests about police violence and systemic racism encompass both communities as well — but the national focus has chiefly been about the impact on Black Americans and the ways white Americans are responding to it.
Many liberal Latino voters and activists, in turn, are trying to figure out where they fit in the national conversation about racial and ethnic discrimination. They have specific problems and histories that can be obscured by the broad “Black and brown” framework or overshadowed by the injustices facing Black Americans. For some, there is also a history of anti-Black racism in their own community to contend with, and a lack of inclusion of Afro-Latinos, who make up 25% of Latinos in the United States.
And while Latinos want people to understand how systemic racism in education, housing and wealth affects them, they are also grappling with an entrenched assumption that racism is a black-and-white issue, which can make it challenging to gain a foothold in the national conversation.
They often find themselves frustrated and implicitly left out.
“We are made to feel unwelcome here no matter what we’ve done or how long we’ve been here,” said Cynthia Garcia, 28, who attended the protest and whose parents immigrated from Mexico. As a child in Phoenix, she said, she regularly heard racist slurs aimed at her family and now hears the same words used against her own school-age children. She said it was important to march, both to “show up for ourselves, and to say this is wrong.”
The searching conversations among Latinos about race are unfolding at a moment when urgent concerns about health, policing and immigration are colliding. They are also taking place before an election in which Latinos are expected to be the largest nonwhite voting bloc and could prove critical in battleground states like Arizona, Florida and North Carolina.
The coronavirus pandemic has torn through Black and Latino communities at disproportionately high rates, in part because so many are considered essential workers in agricultural fields, meatpacking plants, restaurants and hospitals across the country.
And as protests erupted across the country over police killings of Black people, two cases involving Latino men prompted new outcries last week: An 18-year-old security guard was shot and killed by Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies and, in Tucson, Arizona, newly released police body camera footage showed a man dying while handcuffed, pleading with officers for water.
For decades, Latinos have chafed over aggressive policing tactics, including at the hands of Latino officers. In the last several years, hundreds of Latinos, mostly men, have been killed by police in California, Arizona and New Mexico, among other states, though national statistics are hard to come by. Now, activists are pushing for a more explicit conversation about over-policing in Latino communities.
“We’ve always known that police brutality is a Black and brown issue, a poor people’s issue,” said Marisa Franco, executive director of Mijente, a Latino civil rights group.
“Right now it is imperative for non-Black Latino communities to both empathize with Black people and also recognize that it is in our material interest to fundamentally change policing in this country,” Franco said.
In New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Philadelphia and many other cities, thousands of young Latinos have shown up to Black Lives Matter protests in recent weeks. Sometimes, they speak only quietly about their own concerns of anti-Latino racism.
Other times they are more overt. In Phoenix, activists wore face masks emblazoned with “Defund Police” — the last three letters marked in red to emphasize ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An artist passed out a silk-screened Aztec-style painting that showed a black jaguar and a brown tiger, each blending into the other, his own symbolism of the moment.
Last week, police in Tempe, Arizona, approved a $2 million settlement with the family of Antonio Arce, a 14-year-old boy who was shot in the back and killed by an officer in January 2019. Immigrant rights activists routinely point to the fact that local police departments often carry out immigration enforcement, leaving many Latinos terrified to call police out of fear of potential deportation.
The fear and anger has been especially acute in the era of President Donald Trump, who five years ago announced his candidacy by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. The suspect in the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history, in El Paso, Texas, last year, used similar language in his manifesto.
Before voting in favor of a Democratic congressional police overhaul package last week, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, spoke of Hector Santoscoy, a Mexican man who was killed by a San Antonio, Texas, police officer in 1980.
“There’s no doubt that the African American community has borne the biggest brunt of police brutality, but it’s also clear that Latinos have suffered as well,” Castro said in an interview. “There’s a kinship of experience as a community.”
Yet illuminating and addressing discrimination faced by Latinos remains a challenge, Castro said. While many Americans at least learn the basic history of slavery and Jim Crow racism against Black people, there remains a lack of fundamental knowledge about Latino history, which can make it difficult to discuss how social policies have been harmful.
“Many Americans don’t know exactly where you fit in,” Castro said.
In conversations with her three children about race, Alma Aguilar, 31, has been clear about her own experience. “We are not treated the same way as white people,” she tells them.
“People pretty much tend to attack us,” said Aguilar, who attended a small protest near her home in the Phoenix suburbs. “When my son grows up, I don’t want him to be killed by a police officer because he looks a certain way, because he’s a brown boy.”
Even the term “brown” can oversimplify matters, given that it is often used to describe people from multiple continents and different cultures, whose skin color can range from ivory to sienna. It can also be used to refer to some people of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. The opposite of a monolith, Latinos include immigrants in the country illegally and those whose families have been in the United States for centuries.
At a time when Trump has made his anti-immigrant language and policies a centerpiece of his administration, some Latinos — perhaps especially young ones — see themselves as part of a broader fight for racial equity.
“Many Latino youth, they are making the connection, they are pressing their families to have difficult conversations,” said Chris Zepeda-Millán, a professor of Chicano studies and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.
In one indication that Latinos are reacting to the current moment with urgency, a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that 21% of Hispanic voters said they had participated in Black Lives Matter protests, nearly identical to the 22% of Black voters who said they had done so.
But some activists have privately wondered whether the recent police killings of Latinos have received enough attention, and whether there is broad acknowledgment that they, too, suffer from police brutality and systemic racism.
Jonathan Jayes-Green, a longtime activist who in 2015 created UndocuBlack, an organization designed to bring attention to issues of immigration and racial justice, said he had seen a notable shift among Latinos, both in their desire to protest and their willingness to confront racism among themselves.
That activism could be seen when dozens of Latino political leaders recently signed an open letter calling on Univision and Telemundo, the largest Spanish-language news networks based in the United States, to improve their coverage of the protests and to “use their platforms to dismantle racism, colorism and anti-blackness in our own Latino community.” Mijente circulated a similar petition.
Anti-Blackness has deep and complicated roots throughout Latin America, where fair-skinned people are frequently viewed as the ideal and receive better treatment. And those views have often carried over to the United States, where some believe that assimilation is the path to equality.
“Historically we’ve tended to aspire to the American dream, to aspire to whiteness,” said Jayes-Green, who is Afro-Latino. “Latinos have a real active role to play in this fight. We can show that these fights are not separated and that we can be active conspirators in fights against anti-Blackness.”
Many liberal Latino activists have been pushing for huge changes in policing for years, particularly in large urban centers. In many large cities, there is a history of coalitions among Black and Latino community groups fighting for police overhauls, with mixed success.
“The police has always represented this outside force that could harm us,” said Rafael Návar, who said he was roughed up by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department as a teenager.
But policing, Návar pointed out, is only part of the struggle for Latinos, who make up roughly 18% of the country’s population.
“This is a huge moment to expand consciousness around our own community, to recognize the contradiction of what kind of power do we and don’t we have in this country, that despite our size, we don’t even have basic needs met,” Návar said. “This country does not eat without our community, yet the people doing the work can’t keep their own family safe. The lack of power has to make us ask: What kind of respect do we have? How do we organize to have dignity?”
Like several of his friends and cousins, Victor Ortiz, 22, attended protests daily for more than two weeks. Many of their parents are working in jobs that force them to leave their home during the pandemic.
“So it’s like either way, your family is at risk,” he said. “It the same for Black folks, we know that. We have to show up for each other.”
Latinos hardly have the kind of deep political infrastructure that African Americans have built up over decades, with many organizations working toward similar goals. Many liberal Latino activists view the Black Lives Matter movement, and the current wave of protests, as a model.
Ysenia Lechuga, 28, who brought a “tu lucha es mi lucha” sign to several recent demonstrations in Phoenix, said she found Black activism “inspiring.”
“I can come here and preach about immigrants and all the issues that we go through,” Lechuga said of attending the Black Lives Matter protests. “We get racially profiled, we get beat down.”
She thinks the current movement will have a “ripple effect” that will reach her community, too. “Everything is going to start to change,” she said.

Have Americans Warmed to Calls to ‘Defund the Police’? [With graphic(s)]

Just over a month ago, the term “defund the police” was almost entirely the domain of activists and academics. Now it’s a household phrase, with a huge majority of Americans telling pollsters they recognize it.
But what exactly does it mean? And when Americans hear it, what do they think of? For proponents of police reform, is it a useful slogan — or dangerously alienating?
In the immediate aftermath of George Floyd’s killing in late May at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, calls to sharply cut police funding appeared potentially radioactive. Beyond some high-profile progressive figures, including a number of young politicians of color, few leading Democrats embraced the term.
Joe Biden, the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, staked out his position early last month: “I do not support defunding police,” he wrote in a USA Today op-ed article, pushing a range of reforms instead.
But as people have learned more about the term and some city governments have even put it into action, Americans have shown some receptiveness to it. Recent polling suggests that many Americans have come to understand the phrase as a call not to simply eliminate the keepers of the peace, but to reinvest a portion of their funding in other programs and crime prevention techniques.
Running for Congress in New York, Mondaire Jones — a progressive political newcomer who appears poised to win his still-undecided election in a suburban district — articulated that vision last month, when he endorsed “defunding police and reinvesting this money in health, education and alternatives to incarceration.”
Pollsters at PerryUndem, a public opinion research firm, have been studying the public’s response to the protests, and they said they had found voters — particularly Democrats — more curious about than dismissive of the term.
“It had such an initial backlash that people had to explain: ‘Well, no, here’s what it means,’” said Tresa Undem, a partner with the firm. “It was a small window when a lot of learning happened, and it’s these windows when things change.”
Americans see racism as a problem, and broadly support the protests.
Polls have consistently shown that an overwhelming share of Americans see racism as a big problem in the country, and that a slimmer but still-strong majority view Floyd’s death as part of a systemic problem with policing in America. In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month, 74% of Americans said “police violence against the public” was a problem, with 42% calling it a major one.
Overall, support for the protests against racial injustice continues to run high. In various recent national surveys, roughly 6 in 10 respondents have expressed favorable views of the protesters. And Americans generally express support for overhauling police practices. The Kaiser poll found that two-thirds supported banning chokeholds, while roughly three-quarters supported increasing transparency around police misconduct and making it easier for victims of excessive force to sue departments.
But protesters’ central demand has to do with more than reform. They are arguing for undoing and rethinking the way crime is approached in America. And their demands show little sign of going away.
‘Defund’ calls have forced legislative movement.
Councils in cities across the country have committed over the past month to reducing funding for police departments, or even restructuring them entirely. In New York, the City Council passed a budget this week that shifts $1 billion away from the Police Department. Activists criticized it for using a budgetary maneuver to shift around — rather than eliminate — some funding, but it does require the city to abandon plans to hire over 1,000 new officers.
And the very fact that city leaders felt compelled to say they were removing funding from the department marked a huge political shift, grounded in public opinion.
Jawanza James Williams, director of organizing for Vocal-NY, which has been instrumental in the push to defund the New York City Police Department, said organizers were seeking to ensure that calls to defund the police were always understood in tandem with calls to reinvest in other aspects of city government.
“I’m sure ‘abolishing slavery’ was toxic at the time, for most people in the country,” Williams said. “The work is to help people understand the depth of the ‘defund’ framework, and to inform that with other factors.”
When it comes to public opinion, wording matters.
People of varying racial backgrounds tend to express a positive view of their local law enforcement agencies, according to many polls. And Americans usually balk at proposals to cut basic funding from the police. In an Associated Press/NORC poll last month, when asked simply whether they supported reducing funding for police departments, just 25% of Americans said yes, 53% said no, and 21% said neither, suggesting they hadn’t made their minds up yet.
A Fox News poll taken around the same time asked the question a little differently: Would people support taking money away from police departments and putting it toward “mental health, housing and other social services?” In that case, 41% of voters expressed support, while 46% opposed it. Significantly, even though “neither” wasn’t an option, 12% of respondents refused to say either way.
With such a large share of the country still figuring out where it stands on the issue, there is the potential for either side to seize control of the narrative. President Donald Trump has demonstrated that he sees an opportunity to win some ground here, tweeting frequently of his opposition to “defund the police.”
In mid-June, sounding assured that he had the political upper hand, he wrote on Twitter: “Many Democrats want to Defund and Abolish Police Departments. HOW CRAZY!”
Still, as protests have led to legislative results in some cities, they have also helped shift attitudes. A Siena College poll of New York late last month found that a slim majority of the city’s residents would support a reduction in funding for the police. (The question did not mention anything about redirecting funding toward social services.) When asked directly about “defund the police,” New Yorkers were more split: 41% supportive, 47% opposed.
But when asked if mental health professionals should come along when police officers respond to calls dealing with homelessness, drug addiction or mental illness, almost 9 in 10 New York City residents said yes.
In its recent research, the PerryUndem team was struck by how relatively unformed — and therefore influenceable — opinions remained on the meaning, as well as the validity, of calls to “defund the police.”
PerryUndem’s survey was conducted with the online polling firm YouGov, using what is known as a nonprobability panel of respondents, whose composition may not perfectly reflect the makeup of the country. Therefore, the survey’s exact numbers must be taken with a grain of salt. But its findings were striking. Americans were more likely to say that they interpreted “defund the police” to mean taking some funding away from departments and deploying it in “other ways to make communities safer,” rather than simply removing money that the police need.
But neither position was identified by a majority of respondents, and a significant share said they still weren’t sure how to interpret the term.
“When you see that, you see an issue that’s very fluid, and I think it can go different directions as this issue and debate continues,” said Mike Perry, also a partner at the firm. “How the debate continues to take shape — it could move people in either direction.”

In recent months, people all over the world have taken to social media and to the streets to reject police brutality and injustice toward Black people.
Protests have erupted in the United States, driven by recent deaths of Black people, including the death of George Floyd, the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor. While tough conversations — with the intent to inform and provoke change — might be new among friends and colleagues, they are not foreign to interracial romantic relationships, where support and advocacy aren’t just bonuses. They are imperative.
“It’s important to have someone who is enthusiastically listening to and supporting you, and that you’re not always having to be in an educational kind of mode,” says Bill Schaefer, a 29-year-old writer and actor in New York. He and his wife, Jenny Rubé, 28, who is white, have been married for a year and half. They actively discuss racism and both the systemic and blatant effects it has had on Schaefer, who is Black. But the frequency of their talks and Rubé’s advocacy was not always as prevalent as it is now.
“There was one specific incident when we were in Vancouver and someone made a comment to me and I was just so totally caught off guard,” Schaefer said. “And she didn’t say anything — not because she was agreeing with him but because she was also very shocked.”
The incident caused some strain on their relationship and simultaneously made Rubé feel bad, resulting in a well-received discussion and immediate change.
“I had never directly experienced an act of racism and did not know what the appropriate response was,” said Rubé. “I let him down by not speaking up and supporting him when it was important. My lack of action spoke for itself and at the cost of my partner’s hurt.”
And with the national attention these instances are receiving, more talks are being had and increased action is taking place. “I think for her, the light bulb that has changed is not being racist is not the same as being anti-racist, and now she’s really taking that to heart,” said Schaefer. “She’s really committed to calling out the stuff that she sees and rekindling blind spots in herself. Whereas, before she might’ve kind of stayed in her own lane.”
A lucid understanding of the trials and tribulations that Black people face in America is one that is not easy to grasp, but close-knit relationships have proved to create understanding and heightened awareness for non-Black partners. In a 2007 study led by George Yancey of the University of North Texas, 21 white partners in interracial relationships were interviewed and the research showed that white people who marry outside their race are likely to change their thoughts on how race plays a role in society. Additionally, white people who specifically marry Black partners are even more likely to think beyond theoretical ideas as a result of exposure to racism from being with their partner.
Zach Finley, 43, who is white, has always socialized in predominantly Black spaces through his work as a DJ in Greenville, South Carolina, a city with a large Black population. “Very early on, I became comfortable being the minority and realized that those folks weren’t out to get me, like I was taught,” said Finley, who grew up in Greenville in a strongly Republican household with a heavy involvement in the church. “They weren’t people that didn’t look like me who were ready to rob me and steal from me and whatever else they could, if they had the advantage. It was actually the opposite.”
While individually, Finley never had to actively think about race, it wasn’t until he and his wife, Andrea Finley, 32, who is Black, had children that racism became a more overt issue that indirectly affected him as a father. “I think the turning point for us to really start having conversations was when our first son was born because when you have kids, your whole world changes,” said Andrea Finley. “So we realized that he won’t be able to move through the world as a white man.”
The couple had “the talk” with their son when he was 5 years old, where they explained to him that he can’t always do everything he sees his white friends do — a conversation that Zach Finley did not have to hold with his older white son from a previous relationship.
Additionally, since marrying Andrea Finley and being more vocal about issues surrounding race, Zach Finley has noticed a lack of support from some of his family and friends, especially in recent weeks. “I think that’s the hardest part about our relationship,” Andrea Finley said. “It’s not us. We can talk, we can show frustration. We have a safe place, but I think what’s been most difficult for us in the past few weeks has been, in the age of Facebook and social media, you get to see whatever people are thinking. And some of those people are family members that we’ve had family gatherings for, and they’re either quiet as a mouse or they’re liking and commenting on racist posts,”
Unfortunately, issues with extended family and friends aren’t rare in relationships between Black and white partners, often causing the Black partner to hold the white partner accountable and the white partner to figuratively pick a side.
Dr. Racine Henry is a licensed marriage and family therapist in New York. “The most common issues I see for interracial couples, specifically Black and white couples, is as the relationship progresses and becomes more significant, helping the people around the couple, meaning their family, accept — and I hate the word accept because it implies there’s something to accept — and get on board with the couple not just dating and being in a preliminary phase but wanting to move in together or get married or have children,” she said. “It brings up different cultural aspects and different racially themed conversations that then impact how the couple relates to one another.”
Henry’s clientele ranges between couples of different backgrounds, both intraracial and interracial, but it’s her Black-white couples that often experience strain from navigating how to properly support each other.
“I always encourage the couples to have these hard conversations about race away from therapy, when they’re at home, because the point of therapy isn’t what you do in the office, it’s what you do all the time in between in your real life,” Henry said. “Having these talks will make them aware of what comes up for each of them individually. You know, if the white partner feels like they’re always trying to defend themselves, what does that say about their partner to them? What does it mean to them to accept the fact that they may have been offensive and ignorant, and they’ll never truly understand being in Black skin and what that might mean for when they have children or go out to buy a home or go out in the world together.”
Henry said it is equally important for the Black partner to think about their own possible internalized racism and maybe some of the ways in which being with someone who is not Black is a source of shame or guilt for them. This feeling, she said, could stem from messages they may have gotten from childhood or their family, or even friends who indicate they’re doing something wrong or something nonprogressive by being with someone who is white.
Even younger couples face the same issues. Sharon Nealy, 21, met her fiancé, Buck Barfield, 22, when she was 16 and has seen tremendous changes and challenges over the course of their five years together. Nealy, who is Black, is attending the Medical University of South Carolina next fall, while Barfield, who is white, works as a welder, a job that Neeley says has gotten some negative responses from mostly Black people in her social circle where they live in Lancaster, South Carolina. “I get a lot of ‘this white guy, who’s not really even doing that great, comes in and takes the best of our Black women. There’s Black men out here that are doing great that would be a better partner for you and easier to be with,’” Nealy said.
In moments like these, Nealy defends their relationship. And while Barfield’s strongly Republican family has caused an ongoing wedge in their relationship, support from each other and being able to discuss race openly remains their top priority.
“It’s always been important for me to make sure that I have a partner that supports me and tries to make an effort to understand the best they can. It’s something I could not compromise on,” Nealy said. “We’ve always talked about race, but it’s heightened with all this going on. We went to a protest together the other day and he’s learning, he’s listening and he’s trying to be supportive without trying to take my voice either.”
Henry said that being open about differences is the only way to reach some level of understanding in how couples will handle them when they arise. “Race is never going to go away. It’s always going to be present and it’s just going to be compounded when you do things like move in together, have children, move or take new jobs,” she said.
And more than ever, when the 24-hour news cycle is bringing light to the unfair and unjust hardships Black people face, race is likely to drive every aspect of an interracial relationship.
“Having these talks really has implications around where they stand in their respective communities and whether the white partner is as liberal and progressive as they think and if the Black partner is as vocal and active about Black justice as they think,” Henry said. “There’s always going to be something from the outside that reminds you of what you both represent by being together but also by being who you are individually.”

In the Autonomous Zones [With graphic(s)]

At first they called it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.
In early June, protesters aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement took over six city blocks of a gentrified Seattle neighborhood. There, activists screened films, served spaghetti, painted murals, held vigils and planted a community garden.
Their demands, according to Dae Shik Kim Jr., 28, an organizer who lives in the neighborhood, are: Defund the Seattle Police Department by 50%, fund more social services in the city, and drop charges against all protesters.
“We firmly believe that the type of leverage that we have during this moment would not be made possible if it wasn’t for the on-the-ground protesters who are there every night, putting that type of visible, strategic pressure on the city,” Kim said.
Jenny Durkan, the mayor of Seattle, initially praised the zone as “predominantly peaceful,” even while the idea of the area became a culture war punching bag for pundits and politicians.
On June 20, a 19-year-old there was shot and died; many began leaving the zone. Durkan issued an executive order Tuesday calling for the area to be vacated, noting “reported life safety, public health and property issues.” Businesses in the area have filed class-action lawsuits against the mayor. All told, four people have been shot: On June 29, a 16-year-old was shot and killed in the zone.
Since renamed the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, or CHOP, its holdouts spent a week preparing a last stand. “We fought to take this place, we will fight to the end,” an activist told a crowd Saturday.
On Wednesday morning, police swarmed into CHOP, removed barricades, arrested more than 30 people and loaded tents and debris into garbage trucks, citing “ongoing violence and public safety issues” in the area.
“From our perspective, elected officials seem to only care about violence that affects Black people when it’s politically prudent for them,” Kim said.
The emergence of CHOP comes amid new attempts at autonomous zones, including in Richmond, Virginia; Philadelphia; and New York City. But activists have been transforming neighborhoods into short-lived protest camps for at least a century, opening brief portals into alternate sociopolitical realities. Some have had happier endings.
“One simply wants to live differently within the parameters of what’s possible,” said Kristin Ross, a professor of comparative literature at New York University who wrote a book about the 1871 Paris Commune. “It’s about a strategy where you develop the institutions on your own,” she said, the goal being to “develop the collective capacity to take care of yourself.”
The Paris Commune occurred in March 1871 when left-wing Parisians expelled the French army from the city and began a brief experiment in socialist rule. Their methods remain familiar: The Parisians famously toppled a statue of Napoleon in the Place Vendôme.
“The people of Paris just kind of took over the mechanisms of the city and thought, ‘We can run this better in our own interests,’” a CHOP organizer told Roar Magazine. “I see this as part of that tradition and a part of that lineage.”
In that instance, the French army responded; between 6,000 and 50,000 people died.
That state response also has echoes today. “There will never be an ‘Autonomous Zone’ in Washington D.C., as long as I’m your president,” President Donald Trump tweeted June 23, after activists tried to set up the so-called Black House Autonomous Zone near the White House. “If they try, they will be met with serious force!”
What Is an Autonomous Zone?
The term’s meaning is slippery. “Definitions are always contentious,” said Timothy Miller, a professor of religious studies at the University of Kansas and author of “Communes in America, 1975-2000.” “Autonomous zones are really temporary, for the most part, and tend to be protest camps.”
They are not intentional communities, or communes, Miller said: “For me, an intentional community is a group of people gathered around a common purpose — religious or social, typically — with the intention of being there for the long term.”
Today there are hundreds of intentional communities in America listed on just one database, including farming-focused eco-villages and a “dancing sanctuary” for people with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Yet even these boundaries are porous. “There are in-between cases that have features of intentional communities and temporary autonomous zones,” Miller said. He pointed to Occupy Wall Street’s 2011 encampment in New York City as one such example.
The term “temporary autonomous zone” was popularized in 1991 by an anarchist theorist named Peter Lamborn Wilson, better known as Hakim Bey, who published a manifesto that cited a (possibly imaginary) 18th-century network of outlaw “pirate utopias” and the “anarchist liberated zones” from cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling.
Bey theorized that the internet would help bring about impermanent “free enclaves” where culture could spread outside state control. (Bey’s conception of anarchy estranged him from some others; he has published work in the journal of the North American Man/Boy Love Association, a group whose advocacy includes that sex between men and boys should be legal.)
His theories prefigure the temporary enclaves that have bubbled up this month, even as they are snuffed out within weeks, days or even hours.
“Those are the best autonomous zones,” said mIEKAL aND, 62, who founded a small rural Wisconsin anarchist community called Dreamtime Village with Lyx Ish in 1991. (Many self-identified anarchists change their names.) “It doesn’t have to keep fighting to do its thing, because it’s already over. There’s a beginning, a middle and an end.”
Dreamtime Village, which has sometimes billed itself as a Permanent Autonomous Zone, became a destination for nomads traveling America’s back roads, he said. And, nearly three decades later, the community is still going strong. Asked what lessons activists elsewhere may learn from its longevity, he emphasized the value of consensus.
Often, he said, the community draws people in their early 20s who are especially “issue driven,” whether they are militant vegans or animal welfare activists. In order to prevent any individual from derailing important meetings, Dreamtime’s self-governance requires “consensus-minus-one, meaning that a single person can’t block a decision-making process.”
The Long Back and Forth of History
Early in the morning of Jan. 5, 1969, a young Irish Republican named Liam Hillen painted the words “You Are Now Entering Free Derry” on the gable of an abandoned house in the Bogside neighborhood of Derry, his native city.
Hillen spent the night at a protest (which was inspired by the American civil rights movement) and grew angry after watching police and loyalists beat Republicans with batons and rocks. Painting the sign was an act of resistance. “What we were actually doing was just declaring: ‘You are now entering Free Derry, pal, and this is us, and you are not in control,’” Hillen said in 2009.
That summer, locals erected barricades and pushed police and loyalists out of their neighborhood, in a clash known as the Battle of the Bogside.
Residents of Free Derry organized their own security patrols and public transit. The barricades went up and down over the next few years. After a prolonged period, “the British army were nipping at the edges of Free Derry and coming into it en masse in heavily armed patrols and armored vehicles,” said Adrian Kerr, manager of the Museum of Free Derry. “This was two sides at war.”
In early 1972, British forces killed 14 unarmed civilians. The Bloody Sunday massacre transformed Free Derry into a global symbol of resistance. In 2010, the British government released the results of its inquiry into the killings, and people in Gaza flew the Irish flag, Kerr recalled.
And, this month in Seattle, someone set up a wooden sign in tribute to Derry, near the barricades: “You Are Now Entering Free Cap Hill.”
“One of the criticisms that could be laid against the hard left is that they talk a good revolution — they never do it,” Kerr said. “Autonomous zones are where people have actually got up and done something. It might not succeed. They might not last a long time. But it’s not talking, it’s action.”
“My advice for activists in Seattle is to know that we stand with you,” Maeve McLaughlin, a Derry resident and former Sinn Fein assembly member, wrote in an email. “Know that the eyes of the world is on you. Know that one of the key catalysts for the long campaign for justice for the murders on Bloody Sunday was that the world’s media flashed images across the world of the denial of rights, of police brutality and ultimately of murder.”
The Exhausting Practice of Consensus
Perhaps the largest experiment in autonomy today is taking place in a sliver of land in northeastern Syria, where a collection of Kurdish-led militias have fought off the Islamic State group, Turkey and Bashar Assad, the president of Syria.
The autonomous region of Rojava follows the teachings of a revolutionary socialist named Abdullah Ocalan. It is “often described as a paradigm based on three pillars: radical democracy, ecology and women’s liberation,” said Dilar Dirik, a Kurdish activist and researcher at the University of Oxford who has spent time in Rojava.
Rojava was born when a Kurdish militia captured a swath of territory during the Syrian Civil War. “It’s about not being like a state, because the state is seen by many autonomy struggles as actually a system of domination that controls people, rather than provides for them,” Dirik said.
Decision making in Rojava is also an exercise in consensus building. “Raising one’s hands to vote is less important than reaching an understanding,” wrote Zelal Jeger, a chair of TEV-DEM, a political organization in Rojava, in response to questions sent through a representative. “If we put something to a vote, and you receive more votes, and you win and I lose, fair enough — we do it like this. But before we vote, we discuss for hours, until you and I reach a consensus. Then there won’t be incorrect decisions.”
Rojava has also discussed the future of policing. Communes have localized groups of rotating armed volunteers known as Civil Defense Forces. “The logic is that it shouldn’t be people from outside,” Dirik said. Policing “shouldn’t be, like, ‘Random people who don’t know you just come and beat you up when you make a mistake.’ When people know each other, they also understand what’s going on in that community.”
Robin Makhno, an American anarchist who now lives in Rojava, said in an email: “The experiment with democratic confederalism as a post-state way of organizing seemed much more promising than almost anything else being attempted,” In Rojava, Makhno added, it is possible for outsiders “to really connect with the revolution in genuine ways, to affect and be affected by the struggle to change the society, and not just get a photo op or some kind of war tourism.”
Makhno called CHOP a “beautiful and exciting development in an otherwise incredibly bleak time for the United States,” and offers encouragement to protesters in autonomous zones.
“The best self-defense is strong community relationships,” they wrote. “Don’t lose sight of the long-term goals, celebrate every victory and love your comrades. You may have to do things less heroic and more difficult than you imagine.”

NEW YORK — For nearly 15 minutes, an uninterrupted stream of bicyclists passed through Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn on Saturday, moving in a line that stretched several blocks in both directions.
Jingling bike bells, the riders chanted, “Whose streets? Our streets” and “Say his name: George Floyd.” Many had hand-drawn signs — including “We Demand Change” and “Defund the Police” — taped to their backpacks, side racks and handlebars. Others wore T-shirts that read “Black Lives Matter.”
The protest was arranged by a group that calls itself Street Riders NYC. Setting out from Barclays Center and following a route past brownstones, bars and office towers, more than 1,000 two-wheeled demonstrators traversed boroughs and bridges before ending in Central Park hours later.
“You guys all risked it with us,” Orlando Hamilton, 28, co-founder of Street Riders NYC, said through a loudspeaker as a police helicopter buzzed overhead. “So thank you, first of all, for coming out.”
Bicyclists have taken part in marches in New York City since the first demonstrations following Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis at the hands of the police. But more recently, bicycle protests have surged in popularity, transforming into their own distinctive displays.
“I was just hoping to get maybe a couple hundred people together,” said Ted Gusek, a photographer in Brooklyn who helped organize some of the first wave of recent bike involvement in protests. “But it’s all turned into something so much bigger.”
Even for New Yorkers who have grown accustomed to the ongoing demonstrations calling for policing reforms, the bike protests have been hard to ignore with their thunderous chants and the eye-catching signs attached to riders’ handlebars. They have ranged from small groups like the 50-some riders who traveled from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to City Hall on June 25, to the estimated 10,000 who rode through Times Square and Harlem on June 20.
Organizers believe the city’s surge in bike ridership, as coronavirus fears kept New Yorkers away from public transit, combined with the fervent energy around demonstrations, created the perfect conditions for bicycle protests to take off.
Most riders are young, but some are veterans of the city’s previous waves of bike protests. Critical Mass, a social movement around bicycling and environmentalism originating on the West Coast, came to the city in the late 1990s, with large groups of riders taking over roadways in a city that was not as accommodating to bicycles as it is today.
Over the next decade, bicyclists repeatedly clashed with the city over permit struggles, arrests of protesters and physical conflicts, as police held a largely antagonistic relationship with bikers.
Those tensions peaked when more than 5,000 cyclists descended on Union Square Park days before the 2004 Republican National Convention and police arrested hundreds of people in the largest crackdown on local Critical Mass protests at that point.
Evan Friss, a professor at James Madison University in Virginia who has studied the history of bikes in New York City, said that the rides this month have been the largest bike showings since 2004. As symbols of emancipation and individual freedom, he said, bikes have not surprisingly played a visible role in protests following the killing of Floyd.
“Parading on a bicycle and taking over these streets offers this very empowering feeling and a subversion of this typical power structure,” Friss said.
Or as Paige Acevedo, 29, an organizer at the June 25 protest, put it, “It’s like riding in the cavalry.”
Carlos Polanco, a student at Dartmouth College who has organized local marches in support of Black Lives Matter, said the police confronted and arrested bikers at early George Floyd demonstrations, although he has seen fewer clashes with riders since the Police Department came under fire for aggressive encounters with protesters.
After watching police use their own bikes in crowd control, Polanco said march organizers directed people arriving at protests on two wheels to proceed and serve as barricades between walkers and police.
And as bicyclists began forming their own protests, they adopted strategies to keep riders safe, mainly from the drivers they were jamming up in traffic along the route.
During the ride on June 25, bicyclists designated as “blockers” stopped at side streets to hold oncoming traffic out of the intersection, allowing the rest of the cordon to keep pedaling without interruption. At the back, a group of seven riders, referred to as “the caboose,” created a barrier to vehicles coming up from behind and genially prodded straggling riders to keep them inside the pack.
Many drivers have supported riders with honks and cheers. But the caboose group was briefly held up by a run-in with a motorist at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge, where the bicyclists took the roadway instead of the dedicated bike path.
A large black SUV moving close behind the pack clipped the bike of one member of the caboose, Francisco Custodio, 45, of Queens, causing Custodio to fall to the pavement. His riding mate, Liam Murphy, 24, heard the sound and swung back to assist — and found himself face to face with the driver, who had climbed out of the SUV, and was waving and screaming obscenities loudly enough to be heard by cyclists 50 yards farther up.
“What are you gonna do?” the man challenged Murphy.
After a brief exchange of words, the driver took off. Custodio was already back on his bicycle, pushing the group forward.
Some of the rides have brought bicyclists through the East New York and Brownsville neighborhoods of Brooklyn and into Ridgewood in Queens — communities with large Black and Latino populations that organizers say have not seen the same level of demonstrations over the past month as Manhattan and the neighborhoods closer to Downtown Brooklyn have.
“We went deep, deep into the hood, places where these folks have never seen a march come through, and suddenly they’re seeing 6,000 bikes,” Peter Kerre, a co-founder of Street Riders NYC, said of one of his group’s rides. “The reaction was just priceless, folks crying out with gratitude, coming out to say ‘Thank you.’”
Kerre said his group hopes the bicyclists also benefit from the protest routes, changing perceptions they might have held of certain areas as being “unsafe” and growing more aware of the infrastructure imbalances across the city.
For now, organizers do not think the bike protests will die down soon, and riders show no signs of slowing their participation.
Jesse Alava, 31, who went on the Times Square protest and plans to attend others, admitted that after 25 miles on a regular bike ride, he would usually be exhausted.
“But I didn’t feel my legs or any pain because all of that was overcome by the amount of adrenaline from the group,” Alava said of the protest. “It was emotional and it was incredible.”

Sahith Theegala hardly remembered the details, but his father did.
Well before he was a three-time all-American golfer at Pepperdine and long before he made his professional PGA Tour debut this past week at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut, Theegala was a 10-year-old public course golfer trying to figure out fast greens. So his father, Muralidhar, who was born in Hyderabad, India, took him to a practice area at a local private country club he knew of near their home in the Los Angeles suburbs. In short order, a man walked up to them and delivered a clear message about race in golf.
“Rather than saying, ‘Who are you?’ he just said, ‘You’re not supposed to be here.’ He just assumed that because of the color of our skin,” Muralidhar Theegala said.
The incident did not thwart Sahith Theegala’s development to become the top male collegiate golfer in the country, a distinction he earned this season before his No. 1-ranked Pepperdine team had its national championship hopes dashed in March by the coronavirus outbreak.
Theegala, 22, who is Indian-American, now faces the biggest challenge of any amateur’s path, turning pro, as one of the smattering of nonwhite players in a traditionally conservative sport. He also does so at one of the most tumultuous times in history, as the PGA Tour’s restricted environment has been infiltrated by positive tests for the coronavirus among golfers and their caddies.
Standing 6-foot-3, with a languid and unorthodox swing and a sublime short game, Theegala is making the second PGA Tour start of his career this week at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit, hoping that his professional future can have a special impact.
“In light of what’s going on, I’m proud of who I am and what I’m adding to the golf community in terms of diversity,” Theegala said. “Ultimately, we’re all trying to do the same thing in pro golf and that’s make a successful career. Hopefully there is some inspiration behind that, for people who watch me and realize that you don’t have to be the stereotypical white golfer.”
It has never been easy for racial minorities to ascend to the top ranks of professional golf, from Lee Elder breaking the color barrier at the Masters in 1975 — the year Tiger Woods was born — to Harold Varner III addressing racial inequity while vying for the early lead at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth last month while protests began gripping American cities after the death of George Floyd in police custody.
Theegala was born in Fullerton, California, eight months after Woods won his first professional major championship at the 1997 Masters, and moved to Chino Hills outside of Los Angeles when he was about 2 years old. Woods’ rise had been predicted to prompt an influx of golfers from more diverse backgrounds whether they were recreational players or pros, but 23 years later Woods and Varner are the only African American golfers ranked in the top 200.
“I always believed that my boy is something special,” Muralidhar Theegala said. “Hopefully things work out, and by the grace of God, he’ll do wonderful. But I believe that he was born to do something great.”
At least once every two years, Muralidhar Theegala made it a point to take the family back to India, where his parents still live. In 2001, Karuna, his wife and Sahith’s mother, began a battle with thyroid cancer, so her mother, Vijaya Laxmi, came to the United States to help with the children. Every year since, Laxmi has spent six months with them in California and six months back in India. Sahith Theegala balances his connection to India with a Southern California nonchalance: He’s warm and gentle, if not downright goofy at times.
“I’m definitely very proud of my background and my Indian heritage,” Sahith Theegala said. “But when I’m around my friends and other golfers, it’s not something that I think about.”
Theegala grew up in a family that emphasized academics and was enthralled by American sports. When Sahith was less than 2 years old, Muralidhar Theegala would prop the toddler up on his knee to watch Los Angeles Lakers games on television. When Muralidhar cheered, Sahith would get excited. And when Sahith got old enough to understand what was going on, he would cry when the Lakers lost.
Sahith Theegala was close to crying again in January when he finished off a college win at the Southwestern Invitational wearing a Kobe Bryant jersey over his collared shirt, two days after Bryant’s fatal helicopter crash. It was an unusual visual at the end of a golf tournament, but not as unusual as what Theegala has often done before them.
At the first tournament he qualified for as a college freshman, Theegala had warmed up terribly on the driving range, struck by a case of nerves. So he decided to shake them off by intentionally hitting even worse shots. Shanks zipped by competitors trying to prepare, and chunks of grass and dirt barely got out of his shadow. Full-swing flop-shots from a foot off the chipping green made people fear for their safety.
Pepperdine coach Michael Beard was summoned from the clubhouse to see what his young star was doing, and was shocked to see Theegala get to the first tee, take out a handful of irons and swing left-handed.
But when it was his time to tee off, the right-handed Theegala smashed a beautiful left-to-right fade in the narrow gap between a rock outcropping and a canyon. He then hit a 6-iron onto the par-5 green and two-putted for birdie to start his collegiate career.
“I was looking at my assistant like, ‘He’s going to be OK,’” Beard recalled, with a laugh. “To me, that kind of sums him up. He’s very comfortable with who he is.”
When Beard first began recruiting Theegala, he did so as much for the wunderkind’s resume as for his unconventional approach. Theegala had won the first tournament he played in at the age of 6, the prestigious Junior Worlds in San Diego, and won it again at ages 8 and 10. He moved up in age groups, holding his own against future PGA Tour pros like Xander Schauffele and Beau Hossler.
But when Beard first saw him, Theegala also shoved clubs into the wrong slots in his bag, wore socks pulled halfway up his calves and shirt slightly untucked. (Theegala continued needing fashion help throughout his college career.) The Theegalas were not members of a private club, and Sahith was mostly playing at a public course called El Prado.
“It’s literally a goat track. It’s horrible,” Beard said, adding that Theegala would play lots of tournaments to practice on better courses.
Before Theegala made his professional debut in a small Outlaw Tour event in early June, he drove with Roy Cootes, his friend from junior golf and roommate for four years at Pepperdine, to Arizona where they stayed in an $80-per-night motel room. Theegala shot 62 in his first round as a pro before finishing in a tie for third, taking in about a $1,000 profit after the entry fee and expenses.
It was all in an attempt to keep his game sharp, a very different process than most rising stars in the game who are often overburdened with instruction and overreliant on technology to aid in improvement.
“I was asking him how his short game is so put together, and he basically said nothing is mechanics-based,” Cootes said. “He’s just looking at the shot and trying to come up with the best situation to get it in the hole. He doesn’t care how he has to swing or what he has to do to get the ball in the hole. It’s so refreshing. It’s incredible.”
But Theegala’s game was not as sharp as he’d hoped during his PGA Tour debut at the Travelers Championship last weekend, as he shot even par over two rounds and missed the cut. He called it “a great learning experience,” which didn’t change his lofty expectations.
“I don’t want to sound cocky or anything, but I’m playing to win,” Theegala said. “It’s not like I’m just playing to make the cut or anything like that. If you’re not trying to win, what are you doing?”

Trump Is in Trouble in Pennsylvania, but ‘He’s Been Way Behind Before’ [With graphic(s)]

In political speeches for 40 years, Joe Biden has evoked his scrappy childhood in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He kicked off his presidential run last year in Pittsburgh, and as he takes tentative steps out of home confinement in Wilmington, Delaware, the campaign trail has often led to the state next door.
Yet surprisingly, Biden is enjoying no special boost in his native Pennsylvania.
A New York Times/Siena College poll of six battleground states released last week showed that the former vice president’s net approval in Pennsylvania was largely the same as elsewhere: 50% of registered voters viewed him positively and 48% saw him negatively.
President Donald Trump, mired in the lowest point of his presidency, was viewed favorably by just 43% of voters in the six battlegrounds. It helped explain why he trailed Biden in all six states and by 10 percentage points in Pennsylvania, a dire picture of the president’s chances of reelection.
Still, with four months to go until Election Day, Trump could well become competitive again. Leaders of his campaign in Pennsylvania, seizing on Biden’s failure to shine as a favorite son, have sketched out a comeback path for Trump. Its steps include the Republican Party’s advantage in new voter registrations; a return to in-person organizing while Biden’s ground game remains virtual; and a range of issues — including energy policy, reopening the economy and defunding the police — that Republicans believe will peel away swing voters in a state Trump narrowly won in 2016.
“The 10 points doesn’t bother me,” said Lawrence Tabas, chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, referring to Trump’s deficit in the Times poll. “He’s an incumbent president, there’s a crisis and people get angry. It’s a snapshot. He’s been way behind before.”
A spokesperson for the Biden campaign, Emma Riley, said the former vice president considered Pennsylvania crucial to his 2020 chances.
“What’s become clear is that Pennsylvanians have outright rejected the Trump administration’s failed record of leadership, reckless trade wars and corruption that’s favored corporations and their wealthy CEOs ahead of everyday Americans,” Riley said.
Pennsylvania Democrats cautioned that the president’s base of rural and exurban voters, who delivered him the state in 2016 in a startling upset, were still largely supportive.
“Pennsylvania is a swing state. It’s not the Democratic state that a lot of people think it is, not anymore,” said Ryan Bizzarro, a Democratic state representative from Erie County.
Trump’s victory in Pennsylvania by a mere 44,000 votes, out of more than 6 million cast, was a result of sweeping defections by white residents who once voted Democratic, largely in western and northeastern Pennsylvania.
In the 2018 midterm elections and in 2019 local races, Democrats came roaring back as a blue wave swept the Philadelphia suburbs. At the same time, Republicans seized control in blue-collar union counties outside Pittsburgh.
With both parties predicting higher turnout this year than in 2016, winning statewide depends on some delicate dial-twisting: Will the Republican surge in rural counties outweigh the rejection of Trump by suburban voters, especially independents and women?
And will turnout by Black voters in Philadelphia return to near 2012 levels and offset the inroads Trump made in the city in 2016?
“The Republican base is very strong outside southeast Pennsylvania,” said Rob Gleason, a former chairman of the state GOP, who lives in Johnstown, a city in central Pennsylvania. “It’s immovable. Whenever there’s any type of controversy about his administration, more Trump signs go up and flags get raised.”
In Cambria County, which includes Johnstown, Democrats have lost 7,000 registered voters since 2016, while Republicans have gained 3,700. Statewide, Democrats retain a historical registration advantage, but the last four years have brought bad news for the party: Republicans have closed the gap on Democrats by 121,000 since November 2016, a measure of enthusiasm that favors the GOP.
Trump, unlike previous incumbents, has done little to reach beyond his core supporters. Since the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis, the president has played to white voters with racist and inflammatory messages about protesters, Civil War monuments and crime.
Bernadette Comfort, the chair of Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania, disputed that he was running a base-only strategy.
“The president in fact appeals to the single mom in suburbia, the president appeals to the working-class Republican, Democrat, whatever,” Comfort said. “We will go after independents, Democrats, after those folks who did not come out in 2016.”
Nonetheless, the Times poll showed erosion in the president’s base. Trump was favored by 86% of Pennsylvanians who said they voted for him in 2016, down from 92% in a Times poll in October.
In contrast to western Pennsylvania, the growing and racially diversifying counties outside Philadelphia have moved in the opposite direction. Four years ago, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats by more than 18,000 in Chester County. Today, Democrats have an edge of about 1,000.
Shivani Jain, a bank analyst in Chester County, is among the 47% of Pennsylvanians with a “very unfavorable” view of Trump, leaving him a very narrow path to win the state. Jain, 25, has participated in recent protests.
“As a person of color myself, I find the last few years has been heartbreaking,” she said. “I’m hoping with what I’m seeing with the Black Lives Matter movement and how many of my generation have come out, people take that energy to the voting booth.”
An issue Republican officials believe will help the president is the cautious reopening of the state by Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, which has met furious opposition in some regions with fewer coronavirus cases.
Cynthia Sabat, 52, a Trump supporter who lives east of Pittsburgh, called the governor’s support for the city’s ban on consuming alcohol in bars, after a spike in cases over the weekend, “moronic.”
“Wolf is horrible,” she said. “I don’t subscribe to conspiracy theories — I believe the virus is real — but you can’t just keep people from their livelihoods. They have a right to make a living.”
It is unclear, however, whether this will be a winning issue for the president. In the Times poll, only 27% of Pennsylvanians said stay-home orders had gone too far.
Since mid-June, the Trump campaign has returned to in-person door knocking and has held training sessions for volunteers without masks or social distancing. The campaign, which says it has 106 organizers in the state to identify and motivate supporters, appears to be ahead of Biden’s ground game.
“They haven’t hired a state director,” Michael Joyce, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said of the Biden team. “They simply don’t have the ground game, the data operation, the infrastructure every campaign needs to get their candidate across the finish line. It’s too late to catch up.”
Bizzarro, who witnessed Trump flip the longtime Democratic bastion of Erie County in 2016, said Biden needed a stronger ground game and in-person organizing.
“I’ve been on the phone with Biden’s national political director several times already this week,” he said. “The urgency is real. Banking on virtually touching enough voters to win isn’t something I’m comfortable with for Biden, myself as a candidate or any other candidate up and down the ballot.”
The Biden campaign did not dispute its lack of a state director, but said it was working with the Democratic National Committee and state parties to place hundreds of organizers in battleground states including Pennsylvania. Rebounding from 2016, when Hillary Clinton could not find enough local field staff members, Democrats have trained more than 100 organizers in communities of color in the state.
A potentially potent issue for Republicans is Biden’s energy policy, as progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., push him to endorse the Green New Deal.
“Joe likes to claim he’s for Pennsylvania and understands Pennsylvania — on that point alone, he will lose western Pennsylvania with this energy policy,” Comfort said.
A pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, spent nearly $800,000 on attack ads in the state in June, claiming that Biden would ban fracking for natural gas, an industry that has brought thousands of jobs to southwestern Pennsylvania.
The ads misleadingly edit a statement of Biden’s from a debate to suggest he would “eliminate” coal and fracking. In the full quotation, he said he would eliminate “subsidies” for fossil fuels.
The Biden campaign said in a statement that Biden did not endorse the Green New Deal. His climate plan calls for a ban on new oil and gas drilling on public lands, though not on private property.
“There’s clearly an effort by the Trump campaign to mischaracterize his position,” said Rep. Conor Lamb, a pro-fracking Democrat who won his seat in 2018 by carrying some of Pittsburgh’s red-hued suburbs.
Lamb said that four years after Trump campaigned by promising to restore blue-collar jobs, there was little to show for it. “We’ve seen steel-related jobs and coal-related jobs go away,” Lamb said. “The president has four years of a record and he hasn’t delivered.”
A third issue that Republicans said they would lean into in the state is the movement to defund police departments. That has become a focal point of some protesters, including those in South Philadelphia who have faced off against armed counterprotesters at a statue of Christopher Columbus.
“How many white women suburban voters will support that?” asked Joyce of the RNC, referring to calls to defund the police. The issue will “hand the suburbs right to us,” he added.
Tami Drumheller, a Republican in Berks County, in the exurbs of Philadelphia, might seem to be one such voter. She voted for Trump in 2016 but remains undecided this year.
“He’s all for defunding the police and taking away our rights to defend ourselves,” she said of Biden. (While many Democratic officials support reallocating money from police departments to social services, Biden does not.)
Drumheller, an office administrator, might come home to the Republican Party in November. But to listen to her now, it is far from certain.
“He needs to be more understanding about where these people are coming from,” she said of the president and the protesters. “I am a middle-class white female. I do have African American nephews.” It is not her own voice that society needs to hear, she said. “It’s my nephews’ voices.”
“How the president comes off,” she said, “he comes off very ignorant about everything.”

Full text: Epidemiologists have braced for a surge of coronavirus cases. But it has not come yet.
For more than two months, the authorities had been urging New Yorkers to stay indoors and keep their distance from others. But after the police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, tens of thousands of New Yorkers poured into the streets, day and night, to protest police brutality and racism.
Epidemiologists braced for a surge of new coronavirus cases. But it has not come yet.
On May 27, the day before the protests began in New York City, some 754 Covid-19 cases were diagnosed, according to the city's Department of Health. That was the last time the city recorded more than 700 cases on a single day.
By the end of the first week of protests, the city was recording slightly more than 500 cases a day. By the end of the second week of protests, the case counts were in the low 400s or high 300s a day. They've continued to drop slightly. According to revised numbers the city released on Wednesday, the last time New York City recorded more than 300 cases was on June 23.
"We've been looking very closely at the number of positive cases every day to see if there is an uptick in the context of the protests," Ted Long, executive director of the city's contact tracing program, said. "We have not seen that."
In interviews, several epidemiologists expressed either surprise or relief, and offered theories for what occurred. This is what we know:
The virus spread in New York City was already slowing down.
The lockdown enacted in March worked. By the end of May, when the protests began, the virus was not as prevalent in New York as it had been when the lockdown began.
"It seems we in New York City did achieve a substantial decrease in the number of cases so that made the odds of encountering a case of Covid-19 in these protests quite low," said Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University.
Exactly how low is tough to gauge. Throughout June, somewhere between 10,000 and 35,000 New Yorkers per day were tested. The percentage of coronavirus tests in New York City consistently turning up positive declined in June, from about 3 percent at the start to 2 percent. But New York City has released little specific information about current hot spots or clusters, or current infection rates among different age groups.
Some cities and states have made a point of testing demonstrators and released their findings.
In Minnesota, an initiative that targeted demonstrators found that 1.5 percent of them tested positive. In Massachusetts, fewer than 3 percent of protesters did. A positive test does not necessarily mean a person is likely to still be contagious; people can continue to test positive for weeks after becoming ill and starting to recover.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo pledged in early June to dedicate 15 testing sites in the city exclusively to people who attended protests. But a state Health Department spokesman said that data is not yet available.
Kitaw Demissie, an epidemiologist and dean of SUNY Downstate School of Public Health in Brooklyn, said it was possible that in areas with accelerating outbreaks -- such as some southern and western states -- the mass demonstrations could well play a role in the spread of the virus.
Outdoor transmission is more rare.
Conditions at the demonstrations may not have been conducive for transmission, mainly because the protests occurred outdoors, epidemiologists said.
The virus spreads far more easily indoors than outdoors, and close contact indoors is believed to be the main driver of transmission, epidemiologists say. One study based on a review of 110 cases in Japan found that the odds of transmission were 18.7 times higher in closed environments -- everything from fitness studios to tents -- than in open-air environments. Another study involving a review of thousands of cases in China found only a single instance of outdoor transmission.
In Minnesota, where Mr. Floyd was killed, cases among young adults climbed substantially over June. But officials said that gatherings in re-opened bars were partly to blame.
The virus is thought to be spread primarily through the virus-laden droplets emitted when a contagious person coughs, sneezes or talks. When outdoors, this virus-laden air is more quickly diluted and carried away than it would be in a poorly ventilated room. Because a certain quantity of virus is needed for an infectious dose, the dilution can make a significant difference, epidemiologists say.
Another potential factor: Demonstrators were often on the move, marching at a brisk pace. That may have promoted dilution and also spaced people out from each other.
"This doesn't say that being in a crowd is not risky," said Howard Markel, a physician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan who has written on past epidemics. He said that protesters in New York may have just been "incredibly lucky."
He noted that outdoor crowds can accelerate the spread of respiratory viruses -- most notoriously during a war bond parade in Philadelphia during the 1918 influenza pandemic.
Most protesters wore masks.
New York City's Health Department had gone so far as to urge protesters not to chant or yell -- which can increase the likelihood of transmission -- but to instead carry signs and consider bringing a drum.
But while that bit of advice went largely unheeded, most protesters adhered to another: Wear a mask.
Carlos Polanco, 21, from Brooklyn, who protested for 22 or 23 days straight, often out front at protests with a bullhorn, said that organizers made a point of bringing extra masks and distributing them to demonstrators. Mr. Polanco, a rising senior at Dartmouth College, said that he tried to wear a mask except when he was delivering a speech or leading chants -- during which time he tried to keep his six feet of distance from others, he said.
And many protesters complained when police officers at protests did not wear masks.
We could still see a wave of infections tied to the protests.
Some scientists say it's still too early to tell how much transmission occurred at the demonstrations in New York. One reason is that many protesters were young adults -- a demographic in whom severe cases and hospitalizations are less common. As a result, a rise in cases that started within this demographic might remain undetected by public health officials for longer.
"We don't know the impact. We'll see that in the next two weeks," Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said in an interview last week.
Moreover, city officials have instructed contact tracers not to ask new Covid-19 patients if they attended protests, according to a report in The City, a nonprofit news organization.
And the protests continue. Hundreds gathered at City Hall Park over the past week, to demand deep cuts to the New York Police Department budget. Some protesters are camping out in sleeping bags or under tarps. The gathering is drawing some comparisons to the Occupy Wall Street encampment at nearby Zuccotti Park in 2011. Rarely remembered, a vicious cough, called "Zuccotti lung," circulated around that encampment.
So far there has been no clear increase in patients in emergency rooms complaining of pneumonia or flu-like symptoms -- a metric the city's Health Department tracks as an early warning system for Covid-19 transmission.
But public health experts cautioned against drawing too much reassurance from New York's experience. "Like most every other aspect of this pandemic the most predictable thing is the unpredictability," said Professor Markel, the historian and physician from the University of Michigan.

Former Vice President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party outraised President Donald Trump and the Republicans for the second straight month in June, announcing a record haul of $141 million Wednesday night only hours after Trump’s campaign had trumpeted his own $131 million total.
Both of the presidential candidates’ hauls represented huge spikes from May, when Biden raised $80.8 million and Trump $74 million.
The totals were impressive in different ways. For Biden, the huge sum represented a reversal after he had struggled with fundraising for much of the primary campaign, as well as a signal that the party’s donors, big and small, have united behind him. For Trump, it showed the durability of his financial supporters, who delivered his strongest month yet despite a turbulent June and polling showing him trailing Biden badly.
The Trump campaign had celebrated its $131 million haul earlier Wednesday evening, with Brad Parscale, the campaign manager, writing on Twitter, “Americans voting with their wallets, supporting the president.”
Then the Biden campaign announced its larger monthly fundraising sum.
Still, the Trump campaign said that it now had $295 million in the bank, a formidable financial advantage entering the summer months, and that it had raised nearly $950 million over the past two years. Biden’s campaign did not disclose its cash-on-hand total.
Trump spent aggressively as well. The figures released by his campaign show that he spent about $100 million in June.
For the president, June began with the nationwide protests in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. It included the forceful and widely criticized clearing of peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo op; the release of a scalding book by Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton; the ousting of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York; Trump’s first rally since the coronavirus pandemic shut down the country, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which failed to fill the arena; and a series of tweets from the president, including one over the weekend that was later deleted in which a supporter shouted “white power,” that renewed accusations of racism.
Coronavirus cases also began to rise in states that had reopened their economies more fully, including across the South and the Sun Belt.
None of that slowed the flow of money. Nor did multiple national polls showing Trump trailing by double digits, including a New York Times/Siena College survey that had Biden at 50% and Trump at 36%.
Trump’s campaign said it had set a single-day record for online fundraising on his birthday, June 14, collecting $14 million. The full $131 million sum came as Trump held only two fundraising events for the month.
The Trump campaign did not break down how much of the money was raised online or came from large donations — his joint committee with the RNC can receive checks of more than $500,000 — but it said the outpouring was “largely fueled by the robust digital, mail and online donor base” of the president.
The total is more than Trump and the RNC ever raised in a single month in 2016.
“The Trump campaign’s monumental June fundraising haul proves that people are voting with their wallets, and that enthusiasm behind President Trump’s reelection is only growing,” Parscale wrote on Twitter.
In recent days, Trump’s campaign reserved about $95 million in television ads for the fall, beginning after Labor Day in half a dozen states: Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also began buying airtime in Michigan on Wednesday.
Fundraising figures are not required to be publicly released until mid-July. Trump’s campaign released its numbers Wednesday in what appeared to be a political show of force, and hours later, Biden’s team one-upped him.

President Donald Trump announced by far his biggest cash haul of the 2020 campaign in June, bringing in $131 million between his campaign and the Republican National Committee, showing that his money machine continues to hum even as he has slipped in the polls.
The monthly haul represented a spike of $57 million more than Trump had raised in May, which was the first month that former Vice President Joe Biden had outraised the president.
The Trump campaign said that it now had $295 million in the bank, a formidable financial advantage entering the summer months, and that it had raised nearly $950 million over the last two years.
Trump had a tumultuous month of June, which began with the nationwide protests in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police.

Fundraising figures are not required to be publicly released until mid-July. Trump’s campaign released its numbers on July 1 in what appeared to be a political show of force. Biden has not yet released his June figures, but they are expected to be his strongest month of the campaign as well; he raised $80.8 million in May.

How a Black Cowboy Became a Disinformation Target [With graphic(s)]

In late May, as protests against police brutality began to seize American cities, videos of a Black man on horseback wearing a bulletproof vest spread widely on social media. In many of the posts, users suggested that he had stolen a policeman’s horse.
But Adam Hollingsworth, a 33-year-old Chicagoan, is no thief. The horse in the video, Prince, is one of four he owns and rides around the city, where he is known as the Dreadhead Cowboy.
You have to have “some kind of experience to get on a horse to ride it,” he said in a phone interview last week. And, he added, “if you steal a police horse, it’s like kidnapping a police officer. You can’t just get up and steal a police horse.”
As the false accusations piled up, Hollingsworth said his car was vandalized and that he received death threats. The experience hammered home for him that his reason for riding — to expand people’s ideas about Black masculinity and to promote a message of unity in some of Chicago’s most racially segregated neighborhoods — remains urgent.
“It’s not just about me,” he said. “Everything I’m doing is for the future.”
Hollingsworth was born and raised in Woodlawn, a majority-Black neighborhood (nearly 83%, according to a 2019 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning) on the South Side of Chicago. The area has recently appeared in the news as the proposed site of the Obama Presidential Center.
Horseback riding didn’t come into Hollingsworth’s life until adulthood, once he was released from prison after a wrongful conviction for gun possession.
“I don’t play with guns,” Hollingsworth said. “I’m not that kind of guy.” But when his car was pulled over in 2006, someone riding with him did have a gun, which the police found when they searched the car. The officers asked for the ages of the men in the vehicle.
“I was 19, and they said, ‘You’re the oldest, it’s your gun.’”
The bail for his release was set at $5,000. Unable to pay, Hollingsworth sat in jail awaiting a court date. His public defender advised him to fight the charge, believing there was insufficient evidence to convict him. However, after a month in a cell, Hollingsworth said he just wanted to go home and requested his public defender arrange for a plea deal. After serving one month in Cook County Jail, he pleaded guilty and was released on probation.
Upon his release, Hollingsworth focused on staying out of trouble and finding a job. But with a criminal record, this became a herculean task. He began working as an exotic dancer in 2010 and bought his first horse, Wi-Fi, nine years later for $800 during a period of severe depression.
“My horse was my therapy,” he said. Over time, one horse became four. He keeps them in a barn at his uncle’s house in Crete, a suburb of Chicago, and brings them out to the city almost every day, as long as the weather cooperates.
“When this pandemic came about and everyone was depressed and miserable, I thought maybe they can help them too,” he said.
During lockdown, Hollingsworth began riding around Chicago’s Black and Latino communities to bring joy to residents, especially young children. “I didn’t have my father in my life,” he said. “To have a kid say I’m their hero, it melts my heart.” His son, Akil, 12, has begun referring to himself as the Dreadhead Cowboy Jr. Some adults have told him it is their first time seeing a horse in real life.
“You’ve never seen a horse in the hood,” he said.
He said it was not unusual for onlookers to question his ownership of the horses. “When people see me on a horse, they always ask if I’m a police officer. They ask if I got money. If I steal it. How I get it,” he said.
“You could be the brokest guy in the world, but you pull up on a horse in a Black community and everyone thinks you’re rich,” he added.
The fallout from the viral posts about him and Prince left him scared and concerned about how quickly bad information travels online. “People be sharing posts and not be doing their own investigations,” he said. “The first time I see something, I do research.”
But he is also harnessing his growing fame to give back to his community. “I’m trying to put a barn in the city,” he said, specifically in Woodlawn. Already he has raised more than half of his $50,000 goal on GoFundMe.
As for the virus, he’s not afraid. He has been taking all the recommended precautions.
“I’m social distancing being on top of the horse,” he said. “Being a Black man, I’m taking a chance every day by stepping outside.”

NEW YORK — For more than two months, authorities had been urging New Yorkers to stay indoors and keep their distance from others. But after the police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, tens of thousands of New Yorkers poured into the streets, day and night, to protest police brutality and racism.
Epidemiologists braced for a surge of new coronavirus cases. But it has not come yet.
On May 27, the day before the protests began in New York City, some 754 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed, according to the city’s Department of Health. That was the last time the city recorded more than 700 cases on a single day.
By the end of the first week of protests, the city was recording slightly more than 500 cases a day. By the end of the second week of protests, the case counts were in the low 400s or high 300s a day. They have continued to drop slightly. According to revised numbers the city released Wednesday, the last time New York City recorded more than 300 cases was June 23.
“We’ve been looking very closely at the number of positive cases every day to see if there is an uptick in the context of the protests,” said Ted Long, executive director of the city’s contact tracing program. “We have not seen that.”
In interviews, several epidemiologists expressed either surprise or relief, and offered theories for what occurred. This is what we know:
The virus spread in New York City was already slowing down.
The lockdown enacted in March worked. By the end of May, when the protests began, the virus was not as prevalent in New York as it had been when the lockdown began.
“It seems we in New York City did achieve a substantial decrease in the number of cases so that made the odds of encountering a case of COVID-19 in these protests quite low,” said Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University.
Exactly how low is tough to gauge. Throughout June, somewhere between 10,000-35,000 New Yorkers per day were tested for COVID-19. The percentage of coronavirus tests in New York City consistently turning up positive declined in June, from about 3% at the start to 2%. But New York City has released little specific information about current hot spots or clusters, or current infection rates among different age groups.
Some cities and states have made a point of testing demonstrators and released their findings.
In Minnesota, an initiative that targeted demonstrators found that 1.5% of them tested positive. In Massachusetts, fewer than 3% of protesters did. A positive test does not necessarily mean a person is likely to still be contagious; people can continue to test positive for weeks after becoming ill and starting to recover.
In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo pledged in early June to dedicate 15 testing sites in the city exclusively to people who attended protests. But a state Health Department spokesman said that data is not yet available.
Kitaw Demissie, an epidemiologist and dean of State University of New York Downstate School of Public Health in Brooklyn, said it was possible that in areas with accelerating outbreaks — such as some southern and western states — the mass demonstrations could well play a role in the spread of the virus.
Outdoor transmission is more rare.
Conditions at the demonstrations may not have been conducive for transmission, mainly because the protests occurred outdoors, epidemiologists said.
The virus spreads far more easily indoors than outdoors, and close contact indoors is believed to be the main driver of transmission, epidemiologists say. One study based on a review of 110 cases in Japan found that the odds of transmission were 18.7 times higher in closed environments — everything from fitness studios to tents — than in open-air environments. Another study involving a review of thousands of cases in China found only a single instance of outdoor transmission.
In Minnesota, where Floyd was killed, cases among young adults climbed substantially over June. But officials said that gatherings in reopened bars were partly to blame.
The virus is thought to be spread primarily through the virus-laden droplets emitted when a contagious person coughs, sneezes or talks. When outdoors, this virus-laden air is more quickly diluted and carried away than it would be in a poorly ventilated room. Because a certain quantity of virus is needed for an infectious dose, the dilution can make a significant difference, epidemiologists say.
Another potential factor: Demonstrators were often on the move, marching at a brisk pace. That may have promoted dilution and also spaced people out from each other.
“This doesn’t say that being in a crowd is not risky,” said Howard Markel, a physician and historian of medicine at the University of Michigan who has written on past epidemics. He said that protesters in New York may have just been “incredibly lucky.”
He noted that outdoor crowds can accelerate the spread of respiratory viruses — most notoriously during a war bond parade in Philadelphia during the 1918 influenza pandemic.
Most protesters wore masks.
New York City’s Health Department had gone so far as to urge protesters not to chant or yell — which can increase the likelihood of transmission — but to instead carry signs and consider bringing a drum.
But while that bit of advice went largely unheeded, most protesters adhered to another: Wear a mask.
Carlos Polanco, 21, from Brooklyn, who protested for 22 or 23 days straight, often out front at protests with a bullhorn, said that organizers made a point of bringing extra masks and distributing them to demonstrators. Polanco, a rising senior at Dartmouth College, said that he tried to wear a mask except when he was delivering a speech or leading chants — during which time he tried to keep his 6 feet of distance from others, he said.
And many protesters complained when police officers at protests did not wear masks.
We could still see a wave of infections tied to the protests.
Some scientists say it is still too early to tell how much transmission occurred at the demonstrations in New York City. One reason is that many protesters were young adults — a demographic in whom severe cases and hospitalizations are less common. As a result, a rise in cases that started within this demographic might remain undetected by public health officials for longer.
“We don’t know the impact. We’ll see that in the next two weeks,” Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said last week.
Moreover, city officials have instructed contact tracers not to ask new COVID-19 patients if they attended protests, according to a report in The City, a nonprofit news organization.
And the protests continue. Hundreds gathered at City Hall Park over the past week, to demand deep cuts to the New York City Police Department budget. Some protesters are camping out in sleeping bags or under tarps. The gathering is drawing some comparisons to the Occupy Wall Street encampment at nearby Zuccotti Park in 2011. Rarely remembered, a vicious cough, called “Zuccotti lung,” circulated around that encampment.
So far there has been no clear increase in patients in emergency rooms complaining of pneumonia or flu-like symptoms — a metric the city’s Health Department tracks as an early warning system for COVID-19 transmission.
But public health experts cautioned against drawing too much reassurance from New York’s experience. “Like most every other aspect of this pandemic the most predictable thing is the unpredictability,” said Markel, the historian and physician from the University of Michigan.

For Californians, the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic has only deepened existing inequality.
When The New York Times asked what readers wanted to know about how the pandemic is reshaping life in the Golden State, Erin Durham, a former San Franciscan now living in Europe, asked about the kinds of social programs she’s seen there, or whether California might implement one that has recently gained traction: a universal basic income.
“I believe that the basic guaranteed income initiative would work very well in a rich state that relies so much on lower paid workers and that has a huge homeless problem that seems to be irresolvable,” she wrote. “It only looks like a win-win to me.”
While the idea’s most high-profile booster this year was presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a universal basic income, or guaranteed income, experiment has been underway in Stockton, California, since early last year.
The idea is for the government to give everyone, regardless of their wealth or employment status, a certain amount of money every month — in the Stockton case, though, it is 125 residents receiving $500 of donated cash — which is intended to remove the stigma of traditional welfare schemes while ensuring sustenance for all.
Now, Stockton’s first Black mayor, and, at 29, its youngest, Michael Tubbs, is leading a push to expand the idea with a new initiative, Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. Mayors from across the country — including Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Aja Brown of Compton and Libby Schaaf of Oakland — have signed on.
Earlier this week, The Times talked with Tubbs about the effort and about Stockton, a city that emgerged from bankrputcy just five years ago, right now. Here is the conversation, lightly edited and condensed.
Q: Tell me about how Mayors for Guaranteed Income builds on what’s already happening in Stockton.
A: We found that over the last 18 months, as we’ve been piloting in Stockton, so many cities have reached out, wanting to do something like this for their constituents.
Something this important and fundamental has to be at the federal level, but oftentimes, the federal government needs test cases.
Then, during COVID-19, I spent a lot of energy ensuring that the folks in our pilot would have their program be extended at least to January. We were able to do that thanks to a grant.
But then the George Floyd civil unrest happened. I reread the section of “Where Do We Go From Here?”, Dr. King’s last book, about guaranteed income. I was fascinated because I realized he wrote that book in a context very similar to this one, where there was civil unrest in every city. Folks were angry and protesting the structural racism and violence in society.
And so I said, “Let me reach out to some mayors I know and see if they will join with me in creating a network, saying we need to do pilots in our cities, but we also need a federal policy that speaks to economic insecurity.” So that’s what I did.
Q: What’s been the most surprising thing about the program?
A: I wish I had known just how emotional some of the stories would make me.
Stories of people who have jobs, people who, on the surface, everything looks good, but something as small as $500 has been the difference between eviction and homelessness and being housed, or being able to take time off to interview for a better job.
And a lot of them have told our researchers that this is the first time they’ve been seen. I was unprepared for the level of people struggling.
Q: What do you see as the biggest challenge to scaling up?
A: The past couple months you have COVID-19, which showcased how fragile our economy is, where we literally today have essential workers who are putting their health and lives on the line, who still cannot afford rent and are still standing in food banks after work.
You have civil unrest with the George Floyd murder, and people are demanding a change.
I think the hardest part is probably mustering the political will, but if we can’t summon the political will now, at the time when we’re entering into a Great Depression, at a time where we’re at levels of inequality not seen since the Gilded Age, it’s a time of civil unrest.
If we can’t muster the political will to act now, then we have a deeper problem of values and ability to act in our society.
Q: I know that the George Floyd protests were tricky for progressive mayors . But since then, calls have turned more explicitly to defunding or dismantling police departments . Do you support defunding the Stockton Police Department, or is that something you’re looking into?
A: We know that crime correlates with poverty, and things like mental illness can be exacerbated by poverty. So one way we get to a society where we don’t need as many officers is to abolish poverty. I think guaranteed income is a step in that direction.
Ideally, we’d love to live in a world without crime, but as long as there’s crime there will be a need for officers.
In Stockton’s context, because of the bankruptcy, we decimated our police force by about 30% about a decade ago. And twice in the last decade our citizens have voted to tax themselves more to pay for officers.
What we’ve been doing in Stockton is really looking at the role of police. Like other cities, we’ll be doing an analysis of 911 calls to see which are calls that don’t need an officer.
Q: What do you think is the biggest misconception about guaranteed income programs?
A: The biggest misconception I hear is that it rewards people for not working. That’s such a racist trope and it’s not true. The second big misconception I’ve heard is that we can’t afford it. But there are all these proposals now to do that.
So the question is: Do we trust our neighbors to spend money well? I would argue we should and we have to, given this crisis we face.

SEATTLE — Police officers moved in and cleared an area near downtown Seattle early Wednesday where demonstrators had surrounded a police station and established a “no cop” zone amid national protests over police brutality.
City officials cited a series of violent episodes in their decision to vacate the region, including the deaths of two teenagers amid at least four shootings in a matter of 10 days last month.
“Black Lives Matter, and I too want to help propel this movement toward meaningful change in our community,” Chief Carmen Best of the Seattle Police Department said in statement. “But enough is enough.”
The order to vacate the area came amid growing tensions over how to handle an area that was cordoned off as a symbolic statement by protesters after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The continuing problems had drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who blasted Democratic officials in Seattle and Washington state for failing to clear the area earlier.
“If they don’t do the job, I’ll do the job,” the president said last month.
A crowd of police officers pushed through the area just after 5 a.m. Wednesday, some wearing helmets and carrying batons. Officials said the equipment was “not meant to be a preemptive show of force” but was necessary because people gathered in the area were known to be armed.
“I woke up to everybody screaming and running saying, ‘The cops, the cops, they’re here,’ ” said Derrek Allen Jones II, who said he had been staying at the zone for several weeks.
Officers lined up on the edge of the area as a helicopter whirred overhead. Protesters milled around the intersection, some shouting at police. A couple of officers engaged in dialogue directly with protesters as others led a man away in handcuffs. One man said he had been hit with pepper spray as officers pushed protesters back to 12th and Pike Street. A woman raised her fist in the air and chanted, “These are our streets.”
Twenty-three people were arrested on charges of failure to disperse, obstruction, resisting arrest and assault, the Police Department said on Twitter, including a 29-year-old man who had a large metal pipe and a kitchen knife.
In remarks to reporters just after 7 a.m., Best said she supported peaceful demonstrations but said the recent violence in the autonomous zone could not be tolerated.
“Our job is to protect and to serve the community. Our job is to support peaceful demonstrations,” she said. “But what has happened here on these streets over the last two weeks — few weeks, that is — is lawless, and it’s brutal, and bottom line, it is simply unacceptable.”
The city had previously made the unusual decision to abandon a police station in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, board up its windows and let protesters have free rein outside in the wake of demonstrations nationwide over Floyd’s death in police custody.
Protesters laid claim to several city blocks and put up a banner on the front entrance of the emptied police station reading, “This space is now property of the Seattle people.”
After police cleared the area Wednesday morning, officers checked the East Precinct station for “obstacles and other concerns,” Best said, but were not yet operating out of the building.
City workers in yellow and orange vests began removing spray-painted barricades and artwork. Signs reading, “All lives don’t matter until Black lives matter” and “RIP E. Precinct” remained in front of empty tents that lined 12th Avenue.
Protesters had been issued warnings to disperse when police arrived, according to Detective Mark Jamieson.
“There were people that wanted to be arrested,” he said. “We gave multiple orders to disperse and then either people leave or they don’t.”
Police also cleared protesters from nearby Cal Anderson Park, he said.
City officials had insisted that police would not allow any area of the city to fall into lawlessness.
“There is no cop-free zone in the city of Seattle,” Best said last month. “I think that the picture has been painted in many areas that shows the city is under siege. That is not the case.”

Harsh Penalties, Vaguely Defined Crimes: Hong Kong’s Security Law Explained [With graphic(s)]

The sweeping new national security law that China imposed on Hong Kong, aimed at stamping out opposition to the ruling Communist Party in the former British colony, is as “devastating” as some critics feared, a human-rights activist said Wednesday.
Conceived in secrecy and passed Tuesday without serious input from Hong Kong authorities, the law sets up a vast security apparatus in the territory and gives Beijing broad powers to crack down on a variety of political crimes, including separatism and collusion.
In what initially appeared to be an early test of the law, a man was arrested Wednesday after he unfurled a Hong Kong flag during demonstrations and the police said on Twitter that he had been detained for “violating the #NationalSecurityLaw.” It was “the first arrest made since the law has come into force,” the police said. But a closer look at the banner appeared to show words that translated to “No to” in small letters and “Hong Kong Independence” in bigger type. It was unclear if the police were aware.
The law is likely to usher in a new era for Hong Kong, experts say, in which civil liberties are tightly constrained and loyalty to the party is paramount. “All in all, this is a takeover of Hong Kong,” said Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who specializes in the Chinese legal system.
Here’s a guide to the new rules.
— The law targets protesters with harsh penalties, including life imprisonment.
The security law, which includes 66 articles and more than 7,000 words, takes direct aim at the spirited anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong over the past year, prescribing harsh penalties for the tactics commonly used by demonstrators.
As they led a monthslong campaign last year to resist what they called Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s civil liberties, protesters worked to disrupt the city’s reputation for efficiency and orderliness. Some groups attacked police stations, vandalized shops and restaurants and briefly paralyzed the airport.
Under the new law, damaging government buildings would be considered an act of subversion punishable by life imprisonment in “grave” cases. Sabotaging transport would be deemed a terrorist activity punishable by life in prison if it harms other people or causes significant damage to public or private property.
The four major offenses in the law — separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign countries — are ambiguously worded and give the authorities extensive power to target activists who criticize the party, activists say.
“This law is to punish a tiny number of criminals who seriously endanger national security — a sharp sword hanging high over their heads that will serve as a deterrent against external forces meddling in Hong Kong,” Zhang Xiaoming, a deputy director of the central Chinese government office for Hong Kong, said at a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday.
Zhang said that a separate legal system under mainland laws would be used for some of the most serious and imminent national security cases. But he did not specify whether this could be done by bringing mainland prosecutors, judges and prison guards to Hong Kong or by extraditing prisoners to mainland China.
“The law is devastating in that it appears to have no bounds,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch. “Hong Kong activists, accustomed to operating in mostly rights-respecting environment, now face a frightening void.”
— Beijing now has broad authority to intervene in Hong Kong’s legal system.
Hong Kong’s residents have long cherished the city’s independent judiciary, a legacy of British colonial rule that stood in stark contrast to the secretive, party-controlled courts in mainland China.
Under the security law, however, Beijing has given itself wide latitude to interfere in Hong Kong’s legal affairs, insulated from scrutiny by local courts and lawmakers. The legislation will install in Hong Kong a formidable network of security forces answering to Beijing.They include a national security committee in the Hong Kong government and a national security office made up of mainland Chinese officers stationed in Hong Kong and handling cases according to mainland Chinese law.
Under the legislation, the central government in Beijing can intervene in national security cases, especially during crises or if a case is deemed “complex.” The law opens the way for defendants in important cases to stand trial before courts in mainland China, where convictions are usually assured and penalties are often harsh. Trials involving state secrets could be closed to the news media and the public.
The law could bring to Hong Kong many harsh legal practices common in mainland China, experts said. Broadly, the law says that the rights of suspects and defendants in national security cases should be respected. But apart from a presumption of innocence and the right to defend oneself, it does not offer much clarity on those protections, leaving open the danger that some of the harsh, unaccountable practices common on the mainland could spread to Hong Kong.
“As a national security suspect, you can be locked up for as long as six months incommunicado, subject to torture, coerced confession, no access to counsel or family or friends, before the police decide whether to process you for a crime,” said Cohen, the law professor, speaking about practices common in mainland China.
— The law sends a warning to the U.S. and other countries.
Beijing has repeatedly sought to portray the unrest in Hong Kong as the work of foreign countries, especially the United States, accusing them of taking part in a plot to sow chaos in China and topple the Communist Party. Chinese officials have spread unfounded conspiracy theories suggesting that Western countries are funding and directing the activists.
Several parts of the security legislation take aim at the perceived role of foreigners in political activism in Hong Kong.
The new rules apply even to those who are not residents of Hong Kong, with Article 38 suggesting that foreigners who support independence for Hong Kong or call for imposing sanctions on the Chinese government could be prosecuted upon entering Hong Kong or mainland China.
The law also states that national security officials in Hong Kong will “take necessary measures to strengthen the management” of foreign nongovernmental organizations and news outlets in the territory. And, the legislation does not offer specifics.
The legislation seems to be aimed at silencing criticism of the party’s policies in Hong Kong among rights activists, journalists and government officials outside China, experts said.
“The law’s broad extraterritorial scope could well have a chilling effect on overseas NGOs, limiting their ability to partner with Hong Kong groups on sensitive issues like human rights and political reform,” said Thomas E. Kellogg, executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University.
Kellogg said that more restrictions on nongovernmental groups working on issues like human rights, the rule of law and the democratic development in Hong Kong were likely to emerge in the coming months.
The provisions targeting foreigners will most likely worsen tensions between China and the United States, with relations already at their lowest point in decades. The Trump administration has promised a series of punishments in retaliation for the national security legislation, including visa restrictions and limits on exporting defense technology.
On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the passage of the legislation, tweeting: “The CCP’s draconian national security law ends free Hong Kong and exposes the Party’s greatest fear: the free will and free thinking of its own people.”
He also said in a statement, “The United States will not stand idly by while China swallows Hong Kong into its authoritarian maw.”
