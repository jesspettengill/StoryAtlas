WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is promising to keep America great. Joe Biden wants to restore the soul of America.
But there is much more to discuss beyond those two slogans.
The long-anticipated first debate between Trump and Biden on Tuesday night is expected to put a spotlight on pressing issues like the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 200,000 people in the United States, and the fight over the Supreme Court vacancy, whose outcome could affect American society for decades to come.
The debate will include six 15-minute segments on different topics selected by the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News.
Here’s a look at where Trump and Biden stand on those issues.
The Coronavirus
Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic was exceptional, saying he acted early to impose travel restrictions from China; worked with states to acquire equipment like ventilators; and pushed for the development of treatments and vaccines.
The record, however, reveals that the president consistently played down the threat from the virus in the early days when it could have been contained, and ignored or resisted advice from his top health officials. The United States failed to provide enough testing to know how the virus was spreading, and Trump clashed with governors over the need for protective equipment.
There is also mounting evidence of the ways in which Trump and the White House put immense political pressure on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies to accept Trump’s demands that the country reopen more quickly than they thought was safe.
And the president’s demands for a vaccine that could be announced before the election have left the public health community wary of the effectiveness and safety of a vaccine when one is ready.
For many months, Biden has put a major focus on the virus, condemning Trump’s handling of the pandemic and making that a central argument as he asks voters to deny the president a second term.
That is almost certain to be a major focus of Biden’s in the debate, too. He has promised a starkly different approach to combating the virus, stressing the importance of deferring to scientific experts, and he has called for a national mask mandate, which Trump does not support. He has taken care to model good behavior in his campaign, wearing a mask himself and refraining from holding rallies.
The Economy
Until the pandemic, one of Trump’s strongest arguments for reelection was the powerful performance of the economy, which had achieved low unemployment, strong growth and a soaring stock market.
Following the virus-induced shutdowns, the economy’s growth has stalled and unemployment has soared, even with some recovery in recent months. On the campaign trail, Trump promises that the economy will recover — and get even better — if he is given a second term.
The president has also promised a future tax cut for the middle class, though he has not offered specifics, and he has said he wants to reduce the capital gains tax.
Though the economy has been a source of enduring strength for Trump in the polls, Biden is trying to chip away at the president’s standing. He can point to Trump’s handling of the pandemic to argue that the president’s mismanagement has worsened Americans’ economic pain. And he has portrayed Trump as fixated on the performance of the stock market and concerned only about wealthy people.
This summer, Biden rolled out his own set of economic proposals under the slogan “Build Back Better,” including plans to invest in clean energy and to ensure that procurement spending goes toward American-made products.
One area where Biden may come under attack from Trump is tax policy. Biden is calling for tax increases on corporations and high-earning individuals, but he has said that no one earning less than $400,000 would face a tax hike.
The Supreme Court
The intense push to seat Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court before Election Day is part of the president’s four-year effort to remake the federal judiciary, adding conservative-leaning judges to the bench at all levels. With the help of a Republican-controlled Senate, Trump is succeeding in that goal.
The president has already installed two other Supreme Court justices — Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — and more than 200 federal district and appeals court judges, shifting the ideological balance for years to come.
Biden has pledged to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, though he has declined to follow Trump’s lead and release a list of potential nominees. He has called for Senate Republicans to hold off on confirming a successor to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until after the election, noting that early voting is already underway.
Biden has sought to tie the court vacancy to the fate of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that health coverage for millions of Americans is at stake in November’s election. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments a week after Election Day in a challenge to the health law, and the Trump administration is asking the court to strike it down.
Race and Violence in American Cities
The president has seized upon unrest over racial justice as a defining difference between him and Biden, calling the protesters “rioters” and “anarchists” and overtly siding with the police in a bid to cast himself as a “law and order” leader.
The president and his campaign are using episodes of violence against the police to generate fear and support among his base. He has called for much more aggressive use of the National Guard to control disturbances, and has dismissed the Black Lives Matter organization as a radical, violent group.
When he is pressed for accomplishments, Trump cites the First Step Act, which makes some reforms to federal sentencing laws, benefiting minorities. The bipartisan bill passed in 2018 and was signed into law by Trump.
Trump has attacked Biden as anti-law enforcement, often in exaggerated terms — though at times the president has also tried to cast him as overly punitive because of his work on the 1994 crime bill that encouraged incarceration.
Biden has repeatedly said that he opposes defunding the police, though Republicans have still falsely claimed that he supports that movement. He has condemned violence as well.
Biden has called for racial healing and pledged to confront systemic racism, a starkly different approach from Trump’s. In July, Biden released a plan to address racial inequities in the economy.
Biden’s message ties back to the origin of his campaign and themes of American values, as he often talks about being motivated to run by Trump’s comments after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
Trump’s and Biden’s R ecords
Trump’s campaign has sought to highlight his “promises kept” during almost four years in the White House, telling voters that he has done what he said he would do as a candidate in 2016.
At his campaign rallies, the president focuses on trade, including his renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, and imposition of tariffs on China and other countries. He boasts about his 2017 tax cuts and the growth in jobs before the coronavirus pandemic. He cites increases in military funding, his elimination of environmental regulations, peace agreements in the Middle East and actions to shut down immigration.
Many of the president’s promises fell short, a point that Biden may highlight. Despite saying he would build a “big, beautiful wall” across the entire border with Mexico, the president has built only about 200 miles of wall, most of it replacements for existing barriers. He failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he has not controlled federal spending.
In addition to Trump’s record in the White House, another issue likely to come up is his taxes. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, and The New York Times reported on Sunday that he paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and in 2017.
Biden spent 36 years as a senator and eight years as vice president, so he has a voluminous record — giving him achievements to brag about, but also leaving him vulnerable over other aspects of his lengthy career.
Biden can point to accomplishments like the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, as well as the enactment of the Affordable Care Act and his work on the implementation of the 2009 stimulus package.
Trump has portrayed Biden’s record in a very different light, and Biden has faced criticism over a number of votes during the 2020 campaign, including his support for the Iraq War, the 1994 crime bill and NAFTA.
The Integrity of the Election
Trump has spent much of the last year overtly questioning the integrity of the coming election, laying the groundwork for a legal and public relations assault if the initial count shows that he has lost the race.
The president’s primary focus in the past several months has been on mail-in ballots, which he claims — without any evidence — are subject to widespread fraud and should not be allowed.
Biden has warned that Trump is seeking to undermine the legitimacy of the election. “This president is going to try to indirectly steal the election by arguing that mail-in ballots don’t work,” he said in July.
Biden has also warned about possible foreign interference, vowing that as president, he would impose significant consequences for any meddling by foreign powers. Last week, he called Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power a “typical Trump distraction.”

Many Americans watch fireworks displays on Independence Day, eat turkey on Thanksgiving and, on Election Day, head to a school gymnasium, library or senior center to cast a ballot for their favorite presidential candidate.
A deadly pandemic has turned upside down one of these quintessential American routines: the act of voting.
Numerous voters say they are afraid to risk contagion by casting ballots in person. Many poll workers, often at high risk for infection because they are older adults, are afraid to show up. The best alternative, voting by mail, has become tangled in the politics of a deeply divided America as President Donald Trump sows distrust about the process. And now he is suggesting he may not even honor the results of the vote, refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
For many election officials, it is a time stay focused. They are working to set up polling places that are socially distanced and stocked with hand sanitizer. More drop boxes are being installed in some states, and, despite confusion around mailed ballots, county clerks are bracing for processing and counting more of them than ever before.
For people like Tracy Adkison, 48, from Conyers, Georgia, Election Day on Nov. 3 just won’t be the same.
In past years, Adkison has relished voting at her local polling place. It makes her feel like she is part of a community and critical to democracy, she said. It makes her feel like she is being heard.
“I love Election Day,” she said, punctuating every word.
But this year Adkison has requested an absentee ballot and plans to take it to a drop box as soon as she receives it. She believes this is the best chance she has for her vote to be counted in a year when polling places could be understaffed and overcrowded, and when doubts have been raised about the Postal Service’s handling of ballots.
Adkison will miss the patriotic jolt she feels from voting in person, but she said she would never consider giving up the chance to vote.
“Voting, for me, that is my voice,” said Adkison, who is a past president of the Georgia chapter of the League of Women Voters. “I know that is cliché. But that’s the only voice I have right now in my leadership and in my government.”
The pandemic has upended nearly every aspect of election season. Candidates aren’t showing up at roadside diners to court votes by shaking hands and kissing babies. Their supporters aren’t knocking on doors as much as usual or handing out campaign flyers at crowded events, though Trump has held several rallies. The efforts of get-out-the-vote organizations that typically set up booths at county fairs or concerts have been stymied.
The act of voting also has been complicated, as was demonstrated in the problems faced by some states during the primary election. Voters stood in line for hours to cast ballots in some areas. In others the tally of mailed ballots took much longer than expected. Officials have warned that the electorate may face similar circumstances during the presidential election.
Voting has long been difficult, and even denied, for many Americans. Women won the right to vote only 100 years ago. Many measures were taken to keep Black people, Native Americans and others from the polls. Voting rights advocates say present-day restrictions like photo ID laws serve to disenfranchise poor and minority voters.
And this year’s problem-filled election isn’t without precedent. A flu pandemic threw the 1918 midterm elections into chaos.
Back then, the nation was enduring a second wave of a virus that prompted the closures of schools, churches and other spots where the public gathered. Rallies were canceled and candidates complained that the virus was being politicized for rivals’ gains. Polling sites in some parts of the country were closed.
This November, voting could be easier than ever in some states where laws were changed to allow for more access to mail-in balloting.
But the concept of mailing a ballot will be new for many voters. Others may be frustrated if they show up at polling sites they’ve used for years to find the locations have changed.
Besides the logistical issues, international disinformation campaigns are sowing distrust in the electorate. On Election Day, confusion could reign, which can especially deter new voters, some academics said.
“Any change in the mechanics and processes of voting can have an impact,” said D. Sunshine Hillygus, author of “Making Young Voters” and a political-science professor at Duke. “It’s a particularly large hurdle for those who don’t have experience with the process.”
In Wisconsin, Eloisa Gomez plans to be a poll worker in November in South Milwaukee.
As a retiree, she worries she is putting her health at risk. But Gomez knows she will probably be one of the few workers who can speak Spanish in an area of the city where many Latino voters live.
“I know they need bilingual people,” she said. “I just want to be helpful to others.”
Andrew Stratton, 18, a new voter from Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, was so eager to get started that he organized a schoolwide voter registration drive.
“It’s a rewarding experience for pretty much everybody involved,” said Stratton, who plans to vote for Joe Biden.
Get-out-the-vote organizations are urging voters to research their options and make a plan for Election Day.
Shane Wikfors, 56, who lives in Mesa, Arizona, has done just that. He will vote at his regular polling place as he always does, but he will take precautions to protect himself from catching the virus.
Wikfors, a Republican who supports Trump, said voting was “a religious sacrament, like the way you go to church.”
“It’s a very visual presentation of oneself, and you get the little sticker, too,” he said. “I’m not going to let the pandemic steer me away from showing up at the polls.”

Trump Attacked Rochester Protesters. Not All Local Republicans Agree.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
ROCHESTER, N.Y. — It did not take long for President Donald Trump to wade into the civil unrest that seized the city over the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died of suffocation after Rochester police officers placed a hood over his head.
Trump likened a peaceful march in Rochester to the clashes in Portland, Oregon, saying earlier this month on Twitter that the two cities had “bad nights.” The next day, the president incorrectly asserted that “most of the police in Rochester, N.Y., have resigned,” blaming “the Democrat Mayor and, of courses, Governor Cuomo.”
The president’s incursions in Rochester have divided Republicans in Western New York, as candidates vying for Congress and local office weigh whether to embrace Trump or distance themselves from his characterization of the Black Lives Matter movement as “a symbol of hate.”
Nowhere is that dynamic more pronounced than in heavily Democratic districts like Monroe County, which includes Rochester, the state’s third-largest city, where Republicans running as moderates risk alienating voters by adopting the president’s antagonistic view of protesters.
George Mitris, a Republican facing an uphill battle to unseat Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, a Democratic fixture in the region, has openly disagreed with the president’s comments on Twitter, and embraced the Black Lives Matter movement in his platform.
Mitris, as well as some Republicans in Rochester running for the state Legislature, have declined to say whether they would vote for Trump in November, instead focusing their campaigns on local issues and pitching themselves as unifiers above partisan politics.
“I worship no man,” said Mitris, a lawyer running for office for the first time. “I’m really not focused on the president at all, to be quite honest. I’m focused on the people of this community.”
That dynamic is reversed in the 27th Congressional District, a conservative region sandwiched between Rochester and Buffalo, where an insurgent Democrat, Nate McMurray, has been trying to link Rep. Chris Jacobs to the president for months, including during the campaign for a special election in June that ended with Jacobs’ victory.
The two men are opposing each other again in November, and McMurray said he hoped that the attention paid to police brutality in Rochester will motivate liberal voters in the district, particularly “young people who are harder to get out to the polls.”
Even so, McMurray, a Democrat and former town supervisor in Grand Island, northwest of Buffalo, seems aware of the conservative bent of his district, saying that while he believes in systemic change, he doesn’t “want to defund the police.”
“But I want to make sure the police themselves are proud of the work they’re doing and are not tainted by these terrible events that continue to happen,” he said.
Jacobs, a scion of a prominent and wealthy Buffalo family, won in June running on a pro-Trump platform — garnering an endorsement from the president and a campaign robocall from the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. — and has remained firmly in that camp.
His Twitter campaign account prominently features a photo of Trump, and its bio describes Jacobs simply as the “Trump Endorsed Candidate for New York’s 27th Congressional District.”
“Daniel Prude’s death was an unspeakable tragedy, and I believe everyone involved wishes it did not happen,” Jacobs said in a statement, adding that while he fully supported the rights of those who wish to peacefully protest, “the recent violence we’ve seen in the streets is unacceptable.”
“There is no place for this lawlessness in America,” Jacobs continued. “The residents of NY-27 are fed up with the violent riots and support a return to civility.”
Nick Langworthy, chair of the state Republican Party and a longtime resident of Western New York, said that he believed that the unrest in Rochester had played in his party’s favor, with voters from across the political spectrum concerned about “safety and security.”
He argued that the law-and-order message dovetailed with arguments made earlier this year — long before the Black Lives Matter movement gained new momentum — that New York’s recently reformed bail laws were endangering public safety.
“Voters are intelligent: They understand that there’s a cause and effect, and the cause of this is largely the revolving-door criminal justice policies that have been brought to us in the last year,” he said.
He added that he believed that “outside agitators” caused “the worst actions” in protests in Buffalo and Rochester.
“When you have those people that are willing to create mayhem and you can’t hold them, you know, they’re going to continue to perpetuate the situation,” Langworthy said. “And it’s a contagious situation.”
Republicans say they are confident their focus on New York’s high taxes and their law-and-order message are also resonating with voters, echoing refrains from the president.
In the state Senate, which Democrats control by a healthy margin, Republicans have already poured thousands of dollars into digital ads criticizing Democrats’ positions on law enforcement.
In early September, shortly after protesters hit the streets over Prude’s death, Republicans pushed an ominous video on Facebook attacking Samra Brouk, a Democrat running for a state Senate seat that includes parts of Rochester, for her stance on policing.
The video, dark and gloomy, shows a scared woman calling 911 from her bedroom in the middle of the night to report an apparent break-in. Then, a message: “When your family is in danger, you need the police to pick up on the first ring. Now radicals want to defund the police?”
The Facebook ad, paid for by the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee, said the police “stood between the rioters and your family,” an apparent reference to fires set and stores looted in Rochester over the summer following the death of George Floyd.
Brouk said the ads were backfiring. “This community doesn’t respond to that,” she said. “People have been drawn to us saying, ‘Wow. I don’t stand for that. That’s Trumpism. We don’t stand for that.’ It’s kind of energized them.”
Brouk, who is Black, is running in a mostly white district against another first-time candidate, Christopher Missick, a Republican winemaker from the Finger Lakes region who has largely self-funded his campaign.
Missick, who was endorsed by a coalition of police unions, said he supported some changes like empaneling grand juries to address the deaths of unarmed civilians in police custody. He would, however, not endorse either presidential candidate because he was intent on “running a unifying campaign.”
“I need to be able to attract voters across the lines, and I need to go to Albany to defend the interests of Democrats and Republicans in this district,” he said. “Anything that I say or do isn’t going to help either candidate.”
Republicans face daunting odds making inroads in areas like Monroe County, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 14 percentage points in 2016 and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans.
Democrats have tried to galvanize their base by championing the protests in Rochester, calling for criminal justice reforms and railing against Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in his native state.
“He’s fueled these racial tensions, and people are angry,” said Jeremy Cooney, a Democrat running to replace state Sen. Joseph E. Robach, a Republican from the Rochester area who is not seeking reelection.
“People are really angry and they’re really upset and they see this, truthfully, as an indictment of the president,” Cooney said last week.
Still, many residents here have blamed much of the political upheaval in Rochester on local leaders, especially Mayor Lovely Warren, a Democrat.
Warren has faced a barrage of calls to resign following revelations that her administration suppressed bodycam footage of Prude’s encounter with police for months after his death in March. The footage became public this month after Prude’s family filed a public records request.
“Not only did you have an African American die in the custody of the Rochester police department, but you have what appears to be an abdication of leadership and what may be an active cover-up in City Hall,” said Bill Napier, chair of the Monroe County Republican Party.
“There is no way to sit there,” he said, “and blame that on Donald Trump.”

PORTLAND, Ore. — Over the past few years, the streets of Portland have become an arena for polarized political conflict, with far-right groups from around the country bringing guns, flags, bulletproof vests and an eagerness to confront the city’s leftist activists.
After a series of escalating conflicts between opposing factions this summer that involved gunfire from both directions, the city is set to become a stage again on Saturday, when the Proud Boys, a far-right group notorious for engaging in brawls, descend once more on Portland, perhaps in numbers larger than ever before.
Authorities have expressed widespread alarm about the expected clash, as there is talk of further escalation by some members of the Proud Boys. Some members have touted their efforts to buy shields and tactical gear.
“The pattern of these particular groups is clear: to intimidate, instigate and inflame,” said Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, who on Friday declared a state of emergency that will bring more law enforcement agencies to the scene and allow authorities to use tear gas.
In the run-up to the presidential election, now less than 40 days away, the nation’s divisive political scene has increasingly spilled from social media into the streets.
In Louisville, Kentucky, the grand jury decision to not indict police officers for the killing of Breonna Taylor has reignited fury over the laws and systems that shield the police from accountability.
“Until those officers are fired from this department, I promise you we will continue to make these streets hot,” Tamika D. Mallory, an activist, said at a Friday news conference alongside Taylor’s mother, the family’s legal team and other supporters.
While Mayor Greg Fischer has imposed a curfew and the police have blocked off access to downtown, hundreds have continued to publicly protest the grand jury’s decision.
The developments in Louisville also prompted people nationwide to return to the streets in protest, echoing the message of the mass demonstrations that involved millions after the Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May.
President Donald Trump has stoked the tensions of race and policing while building a law-and-order message for his reelection bid. In Portland, where the president has sought to label the city’s anti-fascist activists as domestic terrorists, the Proud Boys have described their event on Saturday as a rally to “end domestic terrorism.”
Law enforcement agencies spent the week struggling to prepare for the gathering and counterprotests, which include an event organized by a local antifa collective and another event organized by Black activists. Under orders from the mayor, the Portland Police Bureau was prohibited from using tear gas, which led some agencies to resist sending support.
“You ask for OSP crowd control units to police an element that is well known to have violent interactions — including the carrying, display and use of firearms,” the Oregon State Police superintendent, Travis Hampton, wrote in an email to leaders in the Portland Police Bureau that partially denied an aid request.
But on Friday, Brown used emergency powers to order that Hampton and the local sheriff take control of public safety in the city for the weekend. That decision will restore the use of tear gas, even for Portland police officers, and Hampton said the city would see a “massive influx” of state troopers.
The goal, authorities said, was to keep the groups separated from each other, which officers have struggled to do this summer, as opposing events have featured fistfights, paintball guns and clouds of mace.
In mid-August, authorities say, a right-wing demonstrator fired his gun twice from his vehicle but did not strike anybody. A week later, amid open clashes in the streets between opposing factions, a right-wing activist pointed his gun at the crowd across from him. The following week, a pro-Trump caravan that planned to drive around the outskirts of the city’s downtown instead went into the city center.
It was at that third event where authorities say Michael Forest Reinoehl, an antifa supporter who had provided security at the demonstrations, fatally shot Aaron J. Danielson, an activist with the far-right group Patriot Prayer. Reinoehl was later killed by authorities in Washington state.
Last month, as the two sides were openly fighting in the streets, the police stayed out of the fray, later explaining that they did not have enough personnel to get in the middle. Asked what is stopping an open firefight from developing, Chief Chuck Lovell of the Portland police said, “I hope it doesn’t come to that.”
The Proud Boys, labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, are self-described “western chauvinists” who have espoused misogynistic and anti-Islam messages; they frequently engage in violent conflicts and celebrate footage of those scenes.
Enrique Tarrio, who leads the Proud Boys, said that he welcomed the expanded law enforcement presence and that he wanted to see that kind of effort for the protesters who have operated in the city. Tarrio said that between 200 and 300 Proud Boys were in the Portland area for the event on Saturday and that he expected many hundreds of other people to participate as well.
Tarrio has said publicly that anyone planning to commit violence should stay away from the event, but when pressed about whether the environment he was creating would attract people looking for violence, he acknowledged that it likely would.
“I’d be stupid to say that I don’t expect someone to come in with some type of nefarious motives,” he said. “The moment that we see it, we will say something. We will be pointing that out to the authorities.”
In Louisville, right-wing groups have also returned to the streets, with militia members carrying rifles and standing outside downtown businesses. It was a scene that paralleled recent events in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse has been charged in the killing of two people after he arrived in the city with a rifle and vowed to protect businesses from demonstrators, who were protesting the police shooting of Jacob Blake.
On Friday, family and lawyers of Taylor demanded that the Kentucky attorney general release further evidence of his role in a case that culminated this week when a grand jury indicted one officer for his role in the botched raid on Taylor’s home but declined to press charges against the two police officers who shot her.
“Release the transcripts!” the group shouted, standing in a square in downtown Louisville and wearing face masks featuring Taylor’s name.
Speaking publicly for the first time since the grand jury’s decision, Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, released a statement denouncing Daniel Cameron, a rising Republican star and the first Black attorney general in Kentucky history, for being on the “wrong side of the law.”
“He knew he had the power to do the right thing,” she said in a statement, which was read by Bianca Austin, Taylor’s aunt. “He had the power to start the healing of this city. He had the power to help mend over 400 years of oppression. What he helped me realize is it will always be us against them. We are never safe.”

Few Police Officers Who Cause Deaths Are Charged or Convicted

Since Breonna Taylor was awakened in the night and shot to death by police in her own home, Louisville, Kentucky, has banned no-knock warrants. A police chief was fired, and so was an officer who was on the scene. But despite demands from across the country, no one was charged in Taylor’s death.
On Wednesday, the Kentucky attorney general announced far less serious charges of wanton endangerment against one of the officers involved in the raid, and none against the two who shot Taylor six times.
The lack of a murder or manslaughter indictment was an outrage to many — but not a surprise.
Few police officers are ever charged with murder or manslaughter when they cause a death in the line of duty, and only about a third of those officers are convicted.
Even as tens of thousands of Americans protest police brutality and demand overhauls of law enforcement, a yawning gulf remains between the public perception of police violence and how it is treated in court.
In the case against the Minneapolis officers charged with killing George Floyd, whose videotaped death in May shocked the nation and was almost universally denounced, the prosecutor, Attorney General Keith Ellison, has warned of the difficulty of prosecuting officers.
“Trying this case will not be an easy thing. Winning a conviction will be hard,” Ellison said in June, even as he announced that he was raising the charge against one of the officers, Derek Chauvin, to second-degree murder. “History does show that there are clear challenges here.”
Union protections that shield police officers from timely investigation, legal standards that give them the benefit of the doubt, and a tendency to take officers at their word have added up to few convictions and little prison time for officers who kill. On top of that, misconduct and poor judgment do not always amount to criminality.
Though state statutes vary, officers are generally permitted to use deadly force if they reasonably perceive imminent danger — a standard that has been criticized as overly subjective and prone to racial bias.
“Police know what to say and what to tell a jury and what to tell a judge to make those folks believe that they were reasonably in fear,” said Kate Levine, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. “Even if there are other witnesses, those witnesses just don’t get the same amount of credibility determination from prosecutors, judges, juries.”
Law enforcement officers kill about 1,000 people a year across the United States. Since the beginning of 2005, 121 officers have been arrested on charges of murder or manslaughter in on-duty killings, according to data compiled by Philip M. Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Of the 95 officers whose cases have concluded, 44 were convicted, but often of a lesser charge, he said.
Convictions include cases like the killing of Laquan McDonald in Chicago, for which Jason Van Dyke was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison, and the killing of Justine Damond in Minneapolis, for which Mohamed Noor was sentenced to 12.5 years.
Many officers who avoided criminal convictions have been fired, like three of the other officers in the McDonald case, and Daniel Pantaleo, who used a chokehold on Eric Garner on Staten Island, New York.
More recently, officers involved in the deaths of Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta have been swiftly indicted on murder charges. Brooks’ case in particular appears to reflect changing standards; because he grabbed and fired an officer’s Taser before he was killed, several experts said they doubted charges would have been brought had the death occurred before the wave of protests and police scrutiny that followed Floyd’s death.
But two cases do not prove that prosecutors have grown more willing — or have yielded to increased pressure — to hold officers criminally accountable. Stinson said any such uptick is so far statistically insignificant. And several equally high-profile investigations of police killings have resulted in no indictment.
The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 illustrates the disconnect between public views and prosecutorial reality: After nationwide protests over his death and a federal review of the case, the officer, Darren Wilson, was not indicted.
In July, Wesley Bell, the prosecutor elected after Brown’s death, ruefully announced that after yet another review he would not seek charges, though he added that his decision did not “exonerate” Wilson.
“The question of whether we can prove a case at trial is different than clearing him of any and all wrongdoing,” he said.
This week the prosecutor’s office in Tucson, Arizona, came to a similar conclusion in the death of Carlos Ingram Lopez, citing “insufficient evidence of a crime,” despite what the police chief had called violations of policy. Lopez died in police custody while naked, handcuffed and face down.
With increasing calls for change, a few states have attempted to make it easier to hold officers accountable.
In Washington state last month, an officer was charged with murder under a 2019 law that eliminated a requirement that prosecutors prove that an officer acted with “malice.” After the death of Stephon Clark in his grandmother’s backyard in Sacramento resulted in no criminal charges against officers, California tightened its use-of-force standard from reasonable to necessary.
But situations in which the police were facing an armed individual are always difficult to prosecute.
In a case like Taylor’s, for example, the fact that her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired at the police first mattered more — under criminal law — than any flawed decisions or shoddy police work that led to the officers breaking down her door in the first place.
“I do understand why people are surprised, because the circumstances that led to Ms. Taylor’s death were preventable and unacceptable in terms of how the police treated her and Mr. Walker that night,” said Taryn Merkl, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former federal prosecutor.
In recent months, some advocates of criminal justice reform have argued that prosecuting officers may even be counterproductive because it avoids addressing systemic problems and, in the words of Levine, allows “the mainstream, white public, and the politicians who represent them to rest easy believing that problem police officers have gotten their due.”
These advocates point out an inherent contradiction between wanting to end over-incarceration and wanting to send police officers — including police officers of color, like Noor — to prison.
“To the extent that the public sees these prosecutions as a neat reckoning against white police officers on behalf of people of color, it is just not that simple,” Levine wrote.
Last month, Essence magazine published an op-ed by two Black prison abolitionists headlined, “We Want More Justice for Breonna Taylor Than The System That Killed Her Can Deliver.” The authors, Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie, did not say that the officers should not be prosecuted, but that “collective responses rooted in arrests and prosecution are likely to lead to dead ends and deep disappointments.”

Homeland Security Chief Denies Downplaying White Supremacist Threat

WASHINGTON — Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, told senators at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that white supremacist extremists represented a lethal domestic terrorist threat, even as he strongly denied suppressing a report that would have rendered that judgment more officially.
“It’s a fabrication, completely,” Wolf said of charges that he buried a Homeland Security Department threat assessment that singled out racist extremists, as well as Russian election interference, because it would have reflected poorly upon President Donald Trump.
Wolf, who has emerged as one of Trump’s most loyal Cabinet members, was pressed over how the agency had responded to unrest, election interference and domestic terrorism during a hearing that could propel him to become the first confirmed head of the department in more than a year.
Wolf’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, lasting just under two hours, came amid allegations from current and former members of his department that the agency had mishandled or downplayed the rising threats of Russian interference and violent white supremacy. The timing of the hearing, about 10 months after Wolf was tapped to lead the agency on an acting basis, was emblematic of the carousel of leadership at a department that has been riddled with vacancies throughout the Trump administration.
Even the legitimacy of Wolf’s acting position was cast into doubt last month when the Government Accountability Office issued a report saying his appointment was illegal, a finding Wolf disregarded Wednesday as “nonbinding.”
“Vacancies and acting officials are a part of every administration, but they should be rare,” said Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the committee. “This administration has abused vacancies to the detriment of this department.” He added that Wolf “has been involved in some of the most controversial and concerning decisions the department has made.”
Wolf faced questions over allegations made by the department’s former intelligence chief, Brian Murphy. Murphy claimed that the acting secretary and his deputy, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, directed him to hold back reports that warned of white supremacist extremism and Russian attempts to denigrate the mental health of Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, because of how they would “reflect upon President Trump.”
Wolf repeated his defense that he did not withhold the intelligence bulletin about Biden in July because of its contents, but because he wanted the presentation of the findings improved. A copy of the September version of the bulletin obtained by The New York Times showed the report grew by only about two pages and still detailed the efforts by Russia to interfere in the election and target Biden.
Peters pressed Wolf on how such minor revisions could have taken around two months and why Wolf asked to review this specific item from an intelligence office that issues such reports regularly.
“I think the important part is the underlying intelligence did not change. I didn’t direct them to change it,” Wolf said. “I was focused on the quality of the product itself.”
Wolf also echoed comments made by Christopher A. Wray, the FBI director, during a House hearing last week that white supremacist extremists have been some of the most lethal among domestic terrorists in recent years. But he said the most deadly threats to the United States overall are foreign adversaries, pandemics and national disasters. He also said the government “cannot ignore” anti-government groups, such as antifa, a leaderless coalition of people who oppose fascism but have at times used vandalism and violence to make their points.
Murphy had also said Wolf retaliated against him when Murphy protested the blocking of the assessments, a claim Wolf denied Wednesday.
“I reject any claim that I attempted to influence or retaliate against any individual at DHS, but specifically Mr. Murphy,” he said.
The House Intelligence Committee and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General are investigating the assertions by Murphy, who is still an employee with the agency. Wolf demoted Murphy after it emerged that his office had included the tweets of American journalists in intelligence briefings distributed to law enforcement agencies, a step seen as a potential infringement on First Amendment rights.
Mark S. Zaid, Murphy’s lawyer, said he and his client “outright challenge Mr. Wolf’s testimony.”
“We look forward to the opportunity to provide classified testimony to congressional and OIG oversight authorities to describe details to the contrary,” Zaid said.
Former Homeland Security Department officials, including a former top terrorism official, Elizabeth Neumann, and chief of staff, Miles Taylor, have concurred that the administration downplayed threats of domestic terrorism and election interference.
Republicans used the hearing to portray Wolf as a seasoned government official who has used his experience in various branches of the department to respond to multiple national emergencies, including the coronavirus pandemic, national disasters and border crossings.
Wolf, who joined the department at its creation as a member of the Transportation Security Administration, was hailed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for his response to demonstrations in Portland, Oregon.
“Mr. Wolf took his responsibility to protect federal facilities and protect federal personnel with the greatest seriousness,” Cruz said.
The inspectors general of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments are investigating the methods of the camouflaged tactical agents deployed to the city, including videos that captured officers spraying tear gas indiscriminately and forcing protesters into unmarked vans. The teams were deployed despite objections from local officials, a move that prompted condemnation from former senior Homeland Security Department officials.
Wolf said 125 federal officers got temporary eye injuries after they were targeted by people in the crowds with lasers.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the committee, allowed Wolf to respond to multiple allegations, including an NBC News report that the firm where Wolf’s wife works received $6 million in contracts from the department since 2018, the same year Wolf became chief of staff for the homeland security secretary at the time, Kirstjen Nielsen.
“I have no role in procurements,” Wolf, a former lobbyist, said in response to the findings. “I don’t even see procurements until they are released and on the street.”
Wolf said if he were involved in procurements, he would recuse himself from any deal with his wife’s firm or his former clients.
Wolf said officials from the inspector general’s office were speaking to employees at a privately run detention facility, where a whistleblowing nurse claimed immigrant women underwent gynecological procedures without fully understanding or consenting to them.
The nurse, Dawn Wooten, has said in a formal complaint that several women detained at Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia told her they were given hysterectomies without their consent. The lawyer for the hospital where the procedures are said to have occurred said records show that just two women in immigration custody were referred for the surgery at the hospital since 2017.
“Some of the facts on the ground and facts we have seen do not back up those allegations,” Wolf. “But if there is a kernel of truth to any of that, you can guarantee I’ll hold those accountable and we’ll take decisive action.”

NEW YORK — When Bill de Blasio first ran for mayor in 2013, he promised that under his administration New York City police officers would patrol residents less aggressively than in the past, especially in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
Five years later, with the help of police, City Council and the city’s district attorneys, de Blasio managed to reduce the total number of arrests, criminal summonses and pedestrian stops by 82%. At the same time, the city’s crime rate fell to lows not seen since the 1950s.
One thing did not change, however, according to a report released this week by the Data Collaborative for Justice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice: Black neighborhoods continued to be policed at a higher rate than white ones.
Although overall enforcement started dropping in 2011 — near the end of Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s final term — and kept falling sharply during de Blasio’s first five years in office, Black New Yorkers were still arrested and stopped at nearly twice the rate of the average city resident, the new report said. White New Yorkers were arrested and stopped at about only one-third of the average rate.
“Despite significant efforts to shrink the footprint of the criminal justice system, we still see these racial disparities,” said Erica Bond, the data center’s policy director.
Police officials have long maintained that racial disparities in enforcement are a consequence of the higher volume of 911 and 311 calls in the city’s low-income neighborhoods rather than bias. More officers are deployed to those areas in response to complaints, driving up arrests, they have said.
The report’s findings come as New York, like other cities across the country, is struggling with a sharp rise in violent crime and with calls to redefine the role of police in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of officers in Minneapolis.
They also have emerged at an exceptionally fraught political moment when New York City police and city leaders have found themselves trying to account for a disturbing rise in gun violence over the summer.
That debate has only intensified as President Donald Trump and his allies in the local police unions have blamed the spike in shootings on failed liberal attempts to rein in police and as some city Democrats have accused police of engaging in a slowdown and backing off on enforcement.
The study’s results appear to confirm as well that predominantly Black communities experience an unequal share of police killings and more frequent contact with police in general.
The new report sidestepped the question of why Black New Yorkers were still being stopped and arrested at the same unequal rate as they were under Bloomberg. As first a Republican and then a registered independent, Bloomberg oversaw a “stop-and-frisk” program under which police searched people for weapons and contraband in high-crime neighborhoods.
“There’s not going to be a single answer,” Bond said.
Enforcement declined under de Blasio …
Less than a month after taking office, de Blasio, a Democrat, announced that he was ending the city’s long legal battle over the Police Department’s practice of stopping and often frisking people on the street, a tactic that a federal judge had ruled in 2013 was racially biased.
Settling the lawsuit was just one move in a broader effort to rein in the more aggressive tactics police had practiced under Bloomberg and his Republican predecessor, Rudy Giuliani.
In 2014, William Bratton, then the city’s police commissioner, ordered officers, with some exceptions, to start issuing criminal summonses instead of making arrests for people caught with marijuana.
Two years later, the City Council passed the Criminal Justice Reform Act, which moved several quality-of-life offenses, like littering, public urination and open-container violations, from the criminal to the civil courts.
In 2018, the district attorneys in Brooklyn and Manhattan laid out plans to stop prosecuting most people arrested on marijuana charges, which had historically been enforced most heavily against Black and Hispanic residents.
These policies had a drastic effect. In 2011, the total number of arrests, criminal summonses and pedestrian stops by police reached a high point of nearly 1.5 million. But by 2018, those enforcement actions dropped more than fivefold to less than 292,700 — even as crime rates also fell.
Pedestrian stops saw the steepest decline, the new study found, falling by 98% from 2011-18. Criminal summonses decreased by 83% in the same period. The study determined that misdemeanor arrests came down by nearly half in those years and felony arrests decreased by 13%.
… Yet racial disparities remained.
Even after years of police using a lighter approach, the study found that Black New Yorkers were still nearly six times more likely to be stopped or arrested in 2018 than white New Yorkers were. And the ratio has not changed in more than a decade, according to the report. In 2003, Bloomberg’s second year in office, it was exactly the same.
“We’ve seen really great progress, but the status quo is never good enough,” said Bill Neidhardt, a spokesperson for de Blasio. “There is clearly work to do, and we’re not going to be shy about it.”
For some Black New Yorkers, the likelihood of being stopped or arrested had actually gone up, the study found.
Black teenagers, 16 and 17 years old, were nine times more likely to encounter police enforcement in 2018 than their white counterparts. That same year, Black people 18 to 20 years old were nearly eight times more likely to be stopped or arrested than whites of the same age.
“Everything is different about policing in communities of color, and it always has been,” said Delores Jones-Brown, a visiting professor of criminal justice at Howard University. “Black people, especially young people, don’t get to enjoy public space in same way whites do.”
The police say 911 calls determine enforcement.
Police officials did not respond to requests for comment on the report, but the Police Department has long insisted that it deploys its officers in response to requests for help. Police activity, senior officials have said, is principally driven by 911 and 311 calls, not racial bias.
“It’s the nature of police assignments that you put the bulk of your cops on the dots — the hot spots, if you will,” Bratton, the former commissioner, said in an interview. “Those hot spots are based on call workloads and complaints, and there are a much larger proportion of them in poor minority neighborhoods.”
Bratton added that while more people might be getting stopped or arrested in Black neighborhoods than in white ones, more victims of crime in those places were also being helped by police. “It’s Policing 101,” he said. “You put cops where things are happening that you’re trying to prevent.”
Jones-Brown, however, said the greater attention Black neighborhoods received from police could not solely be attributed to more crimes being committed in those places. The federal judge who ruled in the stop-and-frisk case, she noted, found that the majority of the pedestrian stops in those neighborhoods never turned up evidence of a crime.
“Even with the drop in enforcement, some officers are still being cued in to Black males as targets,” she said. “Black kids in particular are often treated as a target group, not as individuals.”
Preeti Chauhan, the data center’s director, said that to better understand the racial disparities, researchers would need more data about how the Police Department deploys its officers and how many stops and arrests are “discretionary” as opposed to responses to calls for service. But the study her group released did not include that analysis.
Richard Aborn, president of the nonprofit Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said there was no simple answer to why Black neighborhoods were more heavily policed, but racial bias could not be ruled out as a factor.
“The majority of calls for service do come from communities of color,” he said. “But I think there’s a secondary response, which is that there is implicit bias in policing like there is in every other part of life.
“It’s very hard to measure how that plays out in enforcement activity,” Aborn added, “but I don’t deny that it exists.”

American Suburbs Are Tilting for Biden. But Not Milwaukee’s.

CEDARBURG, Wis. — When Michael Hicks and his daughter chalked “Black Lives Matter” on the pavement outside their suburban home, someone scrubbed it away within hours.
Then Hicks put up a Black Lives Matter sign on his cul-de-sac, only to find it tossed in a dumpster. He finally tried sticking signs in his garden, but a neighbor complained, and he removed them to avoid harassment.
“They just seem to want to silence you in these suburbs,” said Hicks, who commutes from a condo in Grafton, Wisconsin, to a Milwaukee school, where he teaches health and physical education. “They’re so happy in their comfortable bubble.”
As many suburban Americans reject President Donald Trump, threatening his reelection like no other bloc of voters, the suburbs outside Milwaukee, among the most racially segregated in the country, remain a bulwark of support.
The well-educated, affluent counties north and west of the city have for decades delivered Republican landslides, defying a Democratic shift in suburbia in other Northern states.
Voters such as Hicks’ neighbors seem to cleave to the president even more tightly as he has stoked fears of “anarchists” and “looters” imperiling the suburbs, including after the unrest in nearby Kenosha. Their enduring support is one reason Wisconsin offers Trump a still-open path to reelection, even as his opportunities in other battlegrounds have dwindled.
For at least two decades, demographic changes in most American suburbs — an influx of nonwhite, well-educated and younger voters moving out of cities or immigrating from abroad — have pushed former Republican strongholds to become Democratic-trending regions.
In Pennsylvania, the president is trailing Joe Biden by double digits in the vote-rich suburbs of Philadelphia. In Michigan, the decisive swing to Democrats by suburbanites in Oakland County, outside Detroit, gives Biden a statewide edge. In Arizona, the Phoenix suburbs helped Democrats win a Senate seat in 2018 and are the knife edge on which the state is balanced.
But in the region outside Milwaukee, including both inner suburbs and exurbs, Trump led Biden by 48% to 38% in a recent Marquette Law School Poll.
“The WOW counties are key,” said Scott Walker, the former Republican governor of Wisconsin, using the nickname for the three Milwaukee suburban counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington.
Walker said in an interview that the president’s warnings, usually in lurid terms, of civil unrest that would ensue under a Democratic White House were working to solidify wavering suburban Republicans, who four years ago were lukewarm to Trump.
He described a group of five couples that he and his wife, Tonette, have known since they were young parents in Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb. Trump’s tone and personality repulsed the wives, he said, adding that his wife “would say to me, ‘He’s in trouble.’ ” But that is no longer the case.
“A number have completely changed their minds since Kenosha,” Walker said.
For their part, Wisconsin Democrats point to how they have cut into Republican margins in the suburbs in elections since 2016. They may not be persuading many Republicans to vote for Biden, but they are turning out supporters and volunteers who are new residents or were less active voters. Biden led in Wisconsin by 5 percentage points in a recent New York Times/Siena College Poll.
By some measures, greater Milwaukee is the most racially segregated metropolitan region in the country.
Waukesha County, the most populous of the three suburban counties, is 92.5% white and less than 2% Black, figures that have not budged in the last decade, according to the census.
“If you had to find a part of the country that is an example of white flight, Milwaukee would be a poster child,” said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
During the Great Migration, Black residents arrived later to the city than to Cleveland or Detroit, Burden said, and newly built interstate highways in the 1960s made it easier for higher-income white people to move out of the city and commute to work.
“There was an extremely sharp line right at the Milwaukee border,” he said.
The segregation has seemed to play into Trump’s racist messaging around what he calls law and order, which he amplified Sept. 1 during a visit to Kenosha after buildings were burned and businesses looted after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake.
“They’re all young kids and they’re Black, they’re just troublemakers,” David Sorenson, a white suburban voter, said of the protesters, while overlooking that a white teenager who had previously expressed support for the president has been charged with killing two people during the protests.
Sorenson, 80, lives in Muskego, which has a big population of Norwegian descent.
“If I went into Muskego and tried to paint ‘Make America Great Again’ on the street, I wouldn’t get very far,” he insisted. He dismissed Black Lives Matter. “They’re agitators,” he said.
Keith Wetherell, a Biden supporter, called Trump’s claims of upholding law and order “a double standard” given the way his administration has trampled on democratic norms, including sowing false doubts about illegal voting in the coming election.
As Wetherell walked with a friend, Alan Schupp, in Cedarburg, a quaint town of antique stores and ice cream parlors, the two men voiced alarm about Attorney General William Barr. “He’s using the Justice Department for political purposes,” Schupp said.
Both men said they feared putting up Biden yard signs because they would be stolen or might lead to a rock thrown through a window.
Heightened emotions are fueling what both parties expect will be record turnout, but there is also anxiety over the hatred both sides say they feel from partisans of the opposite party, unlike in any past election.
Across the suburban counties, where homeowners on riding mowers attack lawns as big as pastures, there are plenty of yard signs for both presidential candidates. A new feature is that Trump/Pence signs are paired with others proclaiming “We Support Law Enforcement” or “Back the Badge.”
A voter named Rachel, whose one-story house flew a QAnon flag from a pole, said at her front door that the president was trying to make a difference. “It’s just he’s up against so much, so much opposition,” she said.
Declining to give her last name, Rachel, 36, said she believed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which falsely claims that Satan-worshipping top Democrats are running a child sex-trafficking ring that Trump is secretly battling. “Which is probably why they’re fighting him so hard,” she said.
“The people for Trump don’t listen to the mainstream media,” said Karen Jeske, 61, who quit her job in public relations to volunteer full time for the Waukesha Democratic Party. “They have a wall up. How do we get through to them?”
She added, “The best use of my communication skills right now is to do everything I can to get Trump out of office.”
She is dismayed to the point of sleepless nights by hostility she encounters from Trump supporters in replies to text messages she sends on behalf of her party.
“The vileness, I can’t explain,” she said. She quoted several. “Die slowly,” said one. Another read, “I don’t even like Trump but I’d vote for him 100 times over again just to drive a knife into the heart of your soulless mission to pervert our beautiful country.”
“Trump could have done a lot to bring the temperature down, but he loves this divisiveness,” Jeske said. “It will help him get ahead. I think he’s right. I think Donald Trump’s message of ‘I’ll keep you safe’ is resonating with too many people.”
Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, had a more optimistic view. He cited “unprecedented energy” and “volunteers showing up for shift after shift after shift.”
“People are coming out of the woodwork,” he said. “People are concerned about the COVID epidemic, health care and a president that divides people rather than bringing people together.”
Four years ago, Trump actually underperformed in the Milwaukee suburbs. Its college-educated conservatives preferred Republicans like Walker, who pushed Wisconsin rightward after he became governor in 2010, or Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee.
In Waukesha County, Trump received about 20,000 fewer votes than Romney did. The president, who won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point, carried the state by driving up support in rural places among voters without college degrees, mainly white men.
Since 2016, suburban Republicans have fallen in line with Trump, party officials said. Walker, once a grudging Trump supporter, has become a cheerleader.
The president “delivered on big issues that people care about in those WOW counties,” Walker said, ticking them off: reining in the federal government, tax cuts, an anti-abortion record.
Robyn Vining, a Democrat who flipped a suburban Republican seat in the State Assembly in 2018, said Trump’s efforts to stir fear about crime and civil unrest had hit a wall. Polls seem to bear that out.
The Marquette survey this month found that approval of Trump’s response to protests rose among Republicans after he visited Kenosha, but changed only slightly for other voters.
“Most people I talk to are very well aware that we are living in Trump’s America,” Vining said. “To argue that changing the president would create more of the same does not make sense to the people I talk to.”
Bridget Donovan, a self-described Democrat, intends to vote for Trump. She said her top two issues of concern were climate change and health care, and she was well aware of Trump’s efforts to undermine environmental regulations and repeal the Affordable Care Act.
She said she had been “counting the days until Trump is out of the White House” — until the killing of George Floyd in May by the Minneapolis police, which caused protests to erupt around the country.
For her, the presidential race pivoted at that point, said Donovan, 53, who had worked with crime victims in a prosecutor’s office and has family members in law enforcement.
“Instead of being rational about it and looking at ways the criminal justice system could be changed, right away they started burning and acting like lunatics,” she said of protesters.
She dismissed the Black Lives Matter movement. “I think it’s just a kind of guise for looting, burning, committing acts of violence against the police,” she said.
Donovan, who is white, objected to a Biden ad airing in Wisconsin in which the former vice president is the only white person to appear. “To me the definition of racism is excluding a race,” she said.
She has found herself tuning in on YouTube to Black conservative commentators such as a former police officer named Brandon Tatum, who argues that “white privilege” is a myth.
A vegetarian who has donated to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Donovan said she loves animals and taking her dog for walks around Waukesha.
“I’m seeing more and more Trump signs popping up,” she said.

Less than six weeks from Election Day, Joe Biden on Wednesday shied away from two major issues of deep importance to Democrats, giving cautious responses to reporters’ questions about the police shooting of Breonna Taylor and President Donald Trump’s imminent nomination for the Supreme Court.
Several hours after a grand jury in Kentucky declined to charge any officers in the killing of Taylor, indicting one for endangering her neighbors during a raid, Biden said in response to a reporter’s question that he had “not seen the report” and that he knew only broad information.
“I was told going in that there’s one charge against one of the officers. I don’t know the details,” Biden said, before vowing “to try to find that out” on his plane ride home from Charlotte, North Carolina.
Pressed for a fuller response, Biden again responded, “I don’t know the details, so I’m reluctant to comment.”
Two hours later, he issued a statement, sent by his campaign.
“A federal investigation remains ongoing, but we do not need to wait for the final judgment of that investigation to do more to deliver justice for Breonna,” Biden said in the statement. He said the use of “excessive force” needed to be addressed and made an appeal against violence.
On another critical topic, the Supreme Court — days before Trump is expected to announce his nominee to fill the vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death — Biden gave a similarly tentative answer.
Asked what he thought of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is considered Trump’s leading contender, Biden said: “I don’t know her. I just know what’s reported in the press,” before repeating his talking points on the Supreme Court.
Biden’s hesitancy to engage with top-of-mind issues reflected the risk-averse approach he has taken to several facets of his campaign, including limited interactions with voters who might challenge him and relatively few exchanges with reporters during a period of restricted travel and press availability because of the coronavirus.
And it underscores the gamble Biden’s campaign has made for months: that American voters will reward his sober, measured approach to politics that stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s.
But presidential nominees typically are not so circumspect about issues that energize their parties’ bases — especially, in Biden’s case, younger voters and progressives, many of whom did not initially support his candidacy in the primaries.
Told in the session with reporters that protests were expected Wednesday night in response to the grand jury’s decision on Taylor’s death, Biden said that “they should be peaceful.” He then advised against violence, framing his plea as a request to honor Taylor’s memory. Trump has repeatedly attacked Biden in recent weeks, trying to paint him as weak on issues of crime and public safety.
“Do not sully her memory or her mother’s by engaging in any violence,” Biden said. “It’s totally inappropriate for that to happen. She wouldn’t want it, nor would her mother.”
Biden’s remarks came after he spent part of the day campaigning in North Carolina, a battleground state. As he headed there, he had warned that if Republicans confirmed Trump’s nominee, “women’s rights as it relates to everything from medical health care is going to be gone.”
In Charlotte, Biden hosted a Black economic summit meeting where he spoke with a group that included small-business owners and local leaders.
Many Democrats, including Biden, have argued that Americans should be able to decide on Election Day which presidential candidate they want to determine the makeup of the nation’s highest court for years to come.
Republicans, however, have maintained that voters have already made their preferences clear by delivering them both the presidency and a Senate majority. Trump has said he would announce his nominee Saturday, and Senate Republicans appear to have enough votes for confirmation.
But while Biden on Wednesday again laid out the high stakes of the confirmation fight, he did not echo some of the calls to action Democrats have made recently, including suggestions about expanding the Supreme Court.
“We should go to the American people, make the case why this is a gigantic mistake and abuse of power,” Biden told reporters, arguing that the Supreme Court could issue rulings that have significant consequences for women in particular.
“Women will be able to be charged more than men for the same procedures again,” Biden said, apparently alluding to worries among Democrats that the court could strike down the Affordable Care Act. “Pregnancy will be a preexisting condition again.”
Asked after he arrived at the airport back in Delaware on Wednesday night about Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the election, Biden professed little surprise.
“What country are we in?” he said. “I’m being facetious. I said what country are we in? Look, he says the most irrational things.”
“I don’t know what to say,” he concluded.

President Donald Trump’s politicized campaign to label New York City an “anarchist jurisdiction” broadened Tuesday, with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency threatening to move its regional headquarters out of lower Manhattan.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler suggested that local agency officials had become so fearful of New York streets that they are now considering moving offices.
The root of those fears? Wheeler cited 3-month-old protests against police brutality, and a small, recent protest against another federal agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, at a nearby building. That demonstration was quickly shut down by the police.
Few in New York have taken the president’s rhetoric seriously, and the threat from the EPA administrator was also being dismissed as political theater to be deployed in Trump’s reelection campaign.
“Another day, another transparent political game from this federal government,” said Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “The fact is the EPA has abandoned every state since 2017, and they should quit playing political flunky and actually do their job.”
This month, Trump told his attorney general, William Barr, to identify jurisdictions that had allowed “themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,” threatening to withhold federal funding from those places.
Barr complied Monday, delivering a memo that painted New York as a city run amok, descending into violence and anarchy. Wheeler’s threat, first reported by The New York Post, matched that message in tone and rhetoric.
“If you cannot demonstrate that EPA employees will be safe accessing our New York City offices, then I will begin the process of looking for a new location for our regional headquarters outside of New York City that can maintain order,” Wheeler wrote in a letter to Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats. About 580 employees work at the regional office.
Judith Enck, who was the EPA regional administrator in New York under former President Barack Obama, said that the threat was atypical for an agency head to deliver.
“This is a really embarrassing letter for Andrew Wheeler to send,” she said. “He should stick to dismantling environmental laws.”
New York City receives about $7 billion a year in federal funding, with much of it going toward housing, social services and education.
New York officials believe that the president’s efforts are unconstitutional, in defiance of both Congress’ spending power and the 10th Amendment’s protection of states’ ability to operate in their own sphere.
“This is how things start to degrade and democracy is endangered,” de Blasio said Tuesday. “I think it’s ridiculous.”
Donovan J. Richards, the city councilman who chairs the public safety committee, chuckled when asked about the federal government’s designation of New York as a place of anarchy.
“The only anarchist is the Trump administration, that’s why,” he said, when asked to explain his laughter.
Both the state attorney general and city lawyers are preparing legal papers, should the president seek to follow through on his threats.
The Justice Department, in trying to bolster its case that New York is an anarchist jurisdiction, said little about actual anarchists, instead focusing on criminal justice concerns: the city’s rise in shootings, the property damage sustained during protests, de Blasio’s decision to cut some funding for the Police Department, the department’s decision to disband plainclothes anti-crime units, and a decline in local arrests.
That dire depiction of New York leaves out some important context.
So far this year, shootings in the city have indeed nearly doubled, to 1,095 from 567 as of last week. But they are down slightly from a decade ago and are more than 70% lower than in 1993, police statistics show. Reports of major crimes are also down overall from last year and have decreased by more than 10% since a decade ago.
And unlike Portland, Oregon, or Seattle, New York has seen only one instance of significant property damage since the first few days of June, when bands of looters ransacked stores in Soho and midtown Manhattan. At the time, police officials blamed the violence on anarchists and other “outside agitators,” but ultimately backed away from that position, saying that “opportunistic” local criminals were responsible.
The Trump administration’s unflattering description of New York did, however, find favor with its police unions, who have allied themselves with the president and echoed his rhetoric.
“There’s no law and order at all,” said Edward Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association. “It’s total anarchy what’s occurring in the city. People are leaving, businesses are closed and the mayor chooses to do nothing.”
Any defunding of the city would likely mean less money for the Police Department, which also receives money from the federal government.
But Mullins was unconcerned, suggesting that the president is using this threat as a lever to pressure the mayor, and will follow through only if he needs to.
“You got to remember, he’s got a lot of business here, his family’s here, and to defund the police, deep down inside he’s a law and order guy, he always was,” Mullins said.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Joining the writing staff of someone else’s late-night comedy show is not typically the fastest way to further your own performing career, but then again, Amber Ruffin is not your typical television writer.
Since the 2014 debut of “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” she has become one of the most recognizable contributors to that NBC program, writing for its host and appearing in her own recurring segments like “Jokes Seth Can’t Tell” and “Amber Says What.”
Ruffin, who has also written for “A Black Lady Sketch Show” and “Detroiters” (which she also appeared on) and has been featured on programs like “Drunk History,” now has even more airtime to fill: She’s the star of her own late-night series, “The Amber Ruffin Show,” which debuts Friday on NBC’s Peacock streaming service.
It’s an opportunity that Ruffin, 41, was still wrapping her head around during a Zoom call this month, as she contemplated the prospects of creating a TV show during a pandemic and admired the spacious workspace she had only recently returned to at NBC’s headquarters on Rockefeller Plaza.
“When I was here six months ago, I was in an office with 12 other people,” Ruffin said. “Now I’m in this big thing by myself.” She added: “There’s more people at my house: two, me and my husband. I just sit in this room that’s basically the size of my apartment, but I’m the only person in here. It’s very strange.”
Ruffin spoke about the trajectory that has led her to “The Amber Ruffin Show” and how, amid widespread protests and a fraught national debate over racism in law enforcement, she used her “Late Night” platform to share personal stories of her encounters with police. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Did you do anything for fun this summer?
A: I mean, I ate. (Laughs.) The way I eat is recreational. Me and my husband like to get a rental car and drive around, so we did that. That might be our favorite thing to do. Lucky, because it’s the only thing you can do, really.
Q: Comedy has taken you to Chicago, Amsterdam, Denver and now New York. But you grew up in Omaha (Nebraska). How did that experience shape you?
A: It’s the baseline in my mind, because it’s the first place I lived and the longest I ever lived anywhere. But it is not a normal place to be.
Q: Did you find it homogeneous?
A: The word you’re looking for is white. (Laughs.) I just wrote a book with my sister Lacey called “You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey,” and we wrote down all of the crazy, racist stories that happened to her. They’re just the funny ones, and it’s a whole book. And that’s Omaha.
Q: What brought your parents there?
A: They were both in the Air Force, and they got stationed at Offutt Air Force Base, right outside Omaha, and then they stayed there. My mom and dad are from Georgia and Virginia, so they were like: “It’s great here! Look at these unorganized white people trying to harass us. They’re not even dressed the same. They don’t even have a uniform.”
Q: How did you get into comedy as you were growing up?
A: In my house, I could stay up to watch “Saturday Night Live.” I could do whatever I wanted because I was a nerd and I’m the youngest of five, so I had zero supervision. They knew I was going to have my homework done. I also liked performing. I was like, (theatrical voice) “I’m going to do musicals!” That led to theater, which led to improv, which is where the most fun people were.
Q: When you started performing improv comedy professionally in Chicago, did you find it to be a competitive environment?
A: Almost never. Because, well, a lot of the times the people who feel that way are white. (Laughs.) This sounds crazy, but Black people root for Black people so hard, almost no matter what. Whenever white people see me succeeding, they think, well, I could never have had that, because you’re filling some Black slot or whatever. So they don’t see me as anything. But Black people are like, yay! Oh, my God, you did something great!
Q: What ultimately brought you to New York?
A: This show (“Late Night”). Seth called and said, will you move to New York? And I said, yes, I will. Here I come. But I had never considered living in New York. I knew for a fact I was never going to live here. I don’t know a lot of facts. (Laughs.)
Q: When you were hired for “Late Night” did you think it was going to lead to a lot of on-camera time for you?
A: Absolutely not. I got here being like, just be quiet and don’t embarrass yourself. I certainly didn’t think I was going to end up wearing ball gowns and prancing around. That was the surprise of the century. But that is an improv thing. With Seth, if I get a laugh, we get a laugh and we win. I don’t think other people think that. They think, if someone laughs at what you’re saying, even if I set you up, that laugh counts for you and I am lesser than, for some reason.
Q: This past spring, after the police killing of George Floyd, you performed a series of opening monologues on “Late Night” where you talked about your own experiences being harassed by police, including one where an officer pulled a gun on you . How were you approached about doing these segments?
A: I wasn’t asked to do it. I saw what was happening and I went, I have to write something about it. So I did. And it quickly fell apart under the weight of this issue. There was no laughing about it. You couldn’t even do an angry rant. It just couldn’t hold. But it had to be addressed, because we were all feeling it so bad. That’s when I came to them with that idea and was like, what if I just tell this story? And then after it went well, I said, buddy, I got so many more. How many of these do you want to do?
Q: Were you concerned you were just giving cover to a white male host who wasn’t qualified to speak on the subject?
A: If that was how it went down? Sure. But that’s not how it went down. I’m the one being like, I need to do this. He’s the genius moving out of the way. (Laughs.) And I’m here. I’m prepared. Seth’s the guy who was like, get this child a show already. That’s him; he did that.
Q: How did you finally get your own show?
A: A couple years ago, we put together a show idea, and it didn’t go. But then NBC came to us and were like, hey, there’s this thing called Peacock. Can we do that show you pitched a while ago?
Q: Were you disappointed when they previously passed on the show?
A: It was their fourth pass on me, sir, so I’m good. I’ve sold them three pilots, one of which we shot. At least with this, it was just a pitch document. Unlike a sitcom, you don’t have to spend a year writing it and rewriting. You just pitch it, like: It’s a late-night show. Do you want it? No? Cool.
Q: What will the format of your show be?
A: It is going to be a monologue, a piece of comedy, just like a lot of other late-night shows. But then we’re going to do another piece of comedy. Another piece of comedy. And another piece of comedy. It’ll be like the first part of a late-night show, but over and over and over again. (Laughs.) I’m really just trying to disguise the fact that it’s a variety show.
Q: Are you glad to be filming your show from the same studio where “Late Night” is recorded?
A: What’s most comforting is the fact that there’s no audience here. So if you want to fall flat on your face, do it. Coming out and being like, “Hey, everybody, welcome to ‘The Amber Ruffin Show,’ ” while looking 200 people in the face, might have been a lot. I was wondering how I was going to pull that off without tearing up or getting too scared.
Q: Will you continue to work on “Late Night” while you do your own show?
A: Yeah! And if you have a third show, I will work on that. (Laughs.) It’s too much fun. No one ever leaves Seth’s show.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Terrance Moses was watching protesters against police brutality march down his quiet residential street one recent evening when some in the group of a few hundred suddenly stopped and started yelling.
Moses was initially not sure what the protesters were upset about, but as he got closer, he saw it: His neighbors had an American flag on display.
“It went from a peaceful march, calling out the names, to all of a sudden, bang, ‘How dare you fly the American flag?’ ” said Moses, who is Black and runs a nonprofit group in the Portland, Oregon, area. “They said take it down. They wouldn’t leave. They said they’re going to come back and burn the house down.”
Moses and others blocked the demonstrators and told them to leave.
“We don’t go around terrorizing folks to try and force them to do something they don’t want to do,” said Moses, whose nonprofit group provides support for local homeless people. “I’m a veteran. I’m for these liberties.”
Nearly four months after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, some protesters against police brutality are taking a more confrontational — and personal — approach. The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come “out of your house and into the street” and demonstrate their support.
These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause. That includes a diner in Washington who refused to raise her fist to show support for Black Lives Matter, or, in several cities, confused drivers who happened upon the protests.
But the tactics are dividing supporters of Black Lives Matter, with some worried that the confrontational approach will antagonize people who would be otherwise be receptive to the message or play into conservatives’ critique of the protests, which have been largely nonviolent nationally.
Others, frustrated that little has changed since Floyd was killed, say that sitting idly and watching a protest without participating nowadays is to show tacit support for racism.
“We don’t need allies anymore,” said Stephen Green, an investor and entrepreneur in Portland who is Black. “We need accomplices.”
In Rochester, New York, protesters have confronted people at outdoor restaurants, shaking dinner tables. Marchers in Washington also accosted people eating outside, urging everyone to raise their fists to show their allegiance to the movement.
The more personal tactics echo those being used against elected officials, with activists showing up not only outside mayors’ offices but their homes as well. The apartment building where the mayor of Portland lives has been vandalized. Protesters lit fires outside, ignited fireworks and broke into one of the businesses in the building on his birthday. In San Jose, California, demonstrators graffitied and egged the mayor’s house and lit an American flag in front of it, according to police. In Rochester, people have recently posted police officers’ home addresses and information about their families, according to a police spokeswoman.
In Portland, Jessie Burke, who is white and owns a coffee shop in the city, said the message of the movement is getting lost as the protests escalate and target ordinary residents in their homes.
“Everyone was looking for solutions at first, but now it’s just a nightly fight that has gotten progressively more violent — and every neighborhood worries that the fight will come to their neighborhood,” Burke said. “It’s: ‘Wake up, wake up, you need to be in the street protesting if you stand for this.’ ”
Still, Green argued that the tactics are working, even as they inconvenienced him and his family. He described the smell of tear gas and wail of sirens as the marches came to his neighborhood, which he said kept his 7-year-old daughter awake.
“It’s one thing if you can see something on TV, but if you can hear it and you can smell it in your house, that brings it home,” said Green, who grew up in Portland. “We need people willing to say, ‘I’m down to lose this friend because stuff needs to change. I’m down to make my neighbor uncomfortable.’ Being nice wasn’t changing anything.”
Lindsey E. Murphy agreed. She marched with the protesters through one of Portland’s wealthiest neighborhoods on a recent night and found it deeply moving. She watched white demonstrators shouting at white residents that Black lives matter — and the residents joining in with the chant.
“The crowd was — I won’t even say mostly white — I’ll say it was an almost exclusively white crowd marching through the whitest neighborhood in Portland shouting ‘Black Lives Matter’ and ‘Black Lives Are Magic,’ ” said Murphy, who is Black and hosts an educational children’s YouTube series. “What I was witnessing was a lamenting prayer, a cry of remorse and shame among the white people. That’s what I saw. It was healing.”
The American flag that generated controversy is displayed in Kenton, a neighborhood of Portland with small bungalows, lush front gardens and ripe fruit trees. Weeks after the confrontation, the husband and wife who fly the flag said they were fearful of retaliation from the roving protesters, who had found their phone number.
But they say they will not be intimidated into removing the flag.
“I will not take my flag down,” said the husband, who declined to provide his name in a brief interview.
The same night the protesters came to the couple’s door last month, they marched into Kenton’s commercial district and used restaurant picnic tables as fuel for fires. They collected the colorful wooden dividers the neighbors had recently built for outdoor dining and set those ablaze as well. Moses and others in the community ran into the protests with fire extinguishers.
Protesters that night broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A man was later seen scrubbing the sidewalk graffiti — a popular message was “PPB = KKK,” meaning that the Portland Police Bureau is the Ku Klux Klan.
Green said that he opposed the destruction of property but that he also understood it. And he believes, generally, that the more direct protest tactics in residential areas are working because they make the movement more personal and reveal who truly supports change. If someone is against the movement, they keep their lights off or refuse to raise their fist, he said, adding that taking the debate into homes and to families is essential.
Some residents in Portland say the tactics are escalating as the protests become increasingly dominated by white people, including anarchists and supporters of antifa, the diffuse collection of militant left-wing activists that has a strong presence in the region.
The movement is splintered in Portland between more mainstream Black Lives Matter marches and the more aggressive, sometimes chaotic antifa or black bloc protests, where demonstrators dress in black and wear motorcycle helmets or ski masks to make it difficult to identify — or later prosecute — them.
One night this month, there were two protests promoted on the Black Lives Matter Portland Events page: a “nonviolent protest” in the city center and “an autonomously organized direct action march.”
No one appeared to be at the city center protest. But around 200 people were at the other event.
They gathered in an unlit park in a residential neighborhood around 8 p.m. Everyone wore black, including some protesters who had on body armor and motorcycle helmets. They hastily set up picnic tables and supply booths in the dark, using cellphones for light to showcase their goods. There was a food table overflowing with protein bars and Monster energy drinks.
A small free literature selection was set up on the grass and overseen by three people in ski masks. It was a popular offering, and people crowded around, craning to see the pamphlets.
Titles included “Why Break Windows”; “I Want To Kill Cops Until I’m Dead”; “Piece Now, Peace Later: An Anarchist Introduction to Firearms”; “In Defense of Smashing Cameras”; and “Three-Way Fight: Revolutionary Anti-Fascism and Armed Self Defense.”
The energy was something like a carnival in the dark.
“Paint balloons, get your paint balloons,” someone barked.
Around 9:30, the group was in some organizational chaos. They had decided that the neighborhood close by was too racially diverse for them to protest in. They needed to go somewhere whiter.
So the protesters caravaned 20 minutes away to Alberta, a more affluent neighborhood that began being gentrified in the 1990s. They reassembled and marched through the streets.
Neighbors in impressive Craftsman-style homes pulled down their shades and turned off their lights, though many could be seen peering out of dark windows. One woman stepped out of an expansive home looking angry; upon seeing the crowd, she quickly retreated indoors. A few young couples stood in their doorways. A Black woman driving past honked and cheered.
One white man stepped onto his patio clapping and hollering in support of the passing march. The group called for him to join. He smiled and waved them on, still clapping. They began to chant that he was spineless. He looked worried. But the march moved along, and he went back into his house.
“You’ll never sleep tight; we do this every night,” the protesters chanted.

“I’ve always considered myself an outsider,” Osman Yousefzada said recently, sitting on a park bench near his home in North London. “Often, I’ve also been made to feel like an outsider, working in and around institutions and industries like fashion that are rooted in white codes and elitism.”
At 43, he is an established fashion designer (his sculptural silhouettes have been worn by Lady Gaga, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift); an artist (see 2018’s “Being Somewhere Else,” an exhibition on the subjects of race and migration at the Ikon Gallery); a filmmaker (for June’s digital London Fashion Week he showed “Her Dreams Are Bigger,” about Bangladeshi garment workers imagining the wearers of the clothes they made); and the author of “The Go-Between,” a memoir that will be released next year.
The book traces his life from his birth, in 1977, to Afghan and Pakistani migrants in Birmingham, England, to the founding of his eponymous womenswear label, Osman, in 2008.
While he spoke, Yousefzada was taking a break from preparations for the socially distanced appointments he would hold with a handful of editors and buyers during London Fashion Week and meditating on the racial reckoning currently facing fashion in all its capitals.
“At the end of the day, I am in the business of making and selling clothes,” he said. “But communicating through other mediums has let me say much more about what really matters to me. And I have stuff to say.” Here is some of it.
Q: Did growing up in Birmingham expose you to racism?
A: In many ways, 1980s inner-city Birmingham was a proper immigrant melting pot, but we had an extremely conservative and segregated upbringing, despite being side by side with the red light district and gangs.
I grew up in an artisanal family within a tightknit, inward-looking Muslim Pashtun community. The mosque kept us off the streets, but we weren’t allowed to watch TV. I wasn’t allowed to draw. My sisters left school at 11. My neighborhood has sometimes been described as “Jihadi Britain.” Racism was a daily reality in Britain; police brutality, race riots and systematic racism were all culturally endemic.
Q: Why did you go into fashion?
A: My father was a carpenter, and my mother owned a dressmaking business. At 10 years old, I could cut patterns, sew and even buy chiffon and haberdashery, and I would make burqas and dresses for my sisters’ dolls.
My family was very artisanal, but that came out of necessity. Creativity is very much a middle-class luxury. That’s something I came to realize when I left home and encountered a whole new set of codes when I went to study, first at London’s School of African and Oriental Studies, then Central Saint Martins and Cambridge University, and later when I entered the world of fashion.
Q: What was it like being a young, brown British fashion designer in the Noughties?
A: Personally, I was going through a period of real rebellion, from going to university and clubbing to drugs and coming out. Professionally, at some level, it was exhilarating, but it was also profoundly challenging.
It was wonderful to be championed, for example, but the guidance I got — although generally well-intentioned — often felt conditional on adhering to established guidelines. “This is too ethnic, Osman. Oh, people will never understand that. They just won’t buy it.”
Because I never had any money, I often felt like I just had to just smile and take it and be grateful. But it also grated. I wanted people from my background to see themselves and their upbringings reflected.
Q: Is it the same for young designers now?
A: I still think it is quite a closed shop, but I think those sorts of conversations have been changing recently. There is more celebration of distinctive personalities and their ideas, amplified by social media; the fashion schools these days are better at teaching students to bring out their voices, and lots of those voices are starting to break through. It is great to see.
Q: Why did you make the short film “Her Dreams Are Bigger”?
A: Racism and inequality exist at every level of fashion and especially for millions of garment workers. I wanted to create a piece of work that underscored their humanity to those who buy and discard clothes. Watching these women in Bangladesh dream about the lives of those who wore what they made was such a moving experience. It also underscored how racism and sustainability — another big talking point for the industry — are intricately connected.
Consumers in the West need to get better at knowing where their clothes come from and engage with the messiness and complexity of this business if we are going to improve the industry structure.
Q: Is that possible in such a charged climate around topics like cultural appropriation?
A: Yes, when done with integrity — and a proper reeducation in Britain and other countries about the legacies of colonialism and empires and slavery. I remember an era of Black solidarity politics in the 1980s where different marginalized communities fought together against the injustices of the system. In Britain in the 1990s, race activism came off the streets and into government jobs and well-funded bodies, making it almost part of the system the movement had previously fought against.
Can we still fight collectively as marginalized communities? I hope so. I think in part that’s what is being explored right now. We all have to be active citizens.
Q: So what does this mean for your next collection?
A: Well, the last six months have been something of a reset moment both for me and the industry, so it’s much smaller than past seasons — only about 50 pieces. And for the video I am creating to run online, I have written a slightly mad poem about my life, about weaving in and out of different spheres. I don’t feel bitter about my time in fashion, but I think sharing stories and upbringings is key to moving things forward. Hopefully, despite all the uncertainty this season, we will see plenty of examples of that.
Q: Do you feel encouraged by the discussions being had about fashion in 2020?
A: People have to walk the talk. I have been completely rethinking my business since parting ways with investors at the end of last year. I want to refocus away from pursuing relentless growth and toward giving back. These days, that has more value to me.
This season, we are working with a block printing community in Pakistan, ensuring they are paid proper wages, showcasing a heritage craft and hopefully giving back a percentage of sales to them. They are being built into the design process. I’ve also been amazed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which has given focus and inspiration to oppressed communities around the world. When it comes to fashion, the only way we’re going to create more equality is with more assimilation. I hope we are not just having a moment. If we are, I’ll throw myself off a wall.

NEW YORK — In late April, Amy Smilovic began streaming live from the Instagram account of her fashion label, Tibi. About once a week, she and Dione Davis, her styling director, would put on Tibi outfits and talk — easily, authoritatively — about how the clothes made them feel.
“When you feel good about the outfit that you’ve put on, your confidence just can go through the roof,” Smilovic said in one early episode, after Davis modeled a pair of tailored bloomers. In the same session she wryly compared her pandemic state to a “walking pharmaceutical commercial” whose list of symptoms included crying in the shower and sending emails at 4 a.m. Smilovic believed a good outfit could help with that, too.
Tibi designs clothing for “creative pragmatists,” a term Smilovic, 52, coined late last year to describe a style she had long struggled to describe. The look is about balance — being modern but not edgy, she says, and chill but not bohemian. As she once advised on Instagram, where she also occasionally ribs Lululemon moms, Bravo stars and yogurt-straining yogis: “when u dress interesting u will feel interesting.”
From a design perspective, this usually means adding unusual twists to familiar closet staples: an oversize blazer with slits at the elbows; jeans that look as if they’re being worn backward; a crew-neck sweater with rounded shoulder pads. Davis called the weird accents “Tibi Easter eggs.”
As the summer continued, the styling sessions evolved. Instagram Live had become a popular feature in the pandemic as people (or brands, mostly) sought new ways to connect with homebound followers. At the beginning, Smilovic and Davis streamed from their homes, splitting the screen in half.
When they were allowed to return to their SoHo storefront and Wall Street office, the live sessions became more polished (but not too polished), eventually overseen by a filmmaker on staff. By September, viewership had grown from about 5,000 to 20,000. Some of the products featured were selling out online within days, they said.
Elaine Chang, president of Tibi, had a theory about why the videos were resonating: “When all of us were consumed by 24/7 fight-or-flight mode, being able to share in Amy’s conversations about fashion and what it means for people reminded us of human potential,” she said. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel.”
The good news was that Tibi’s customer base was growing, with Instagram now driving 10% to 15% of all sales, the company said.
The bad news was that the world was still a catastrophe. There was no tiptoeing into this summer of hell — a season marked by widespread illness and staggering death tolls, police brutality and mass protests. Unemployment spiked. Industries collapsed. Sales at clothing and accessories stores dropped more than 50%.
One day Smilovic was jetting off to Paris Fashion Week, her label on track to pull in $55 to $60 million in sales in 2020. Three weeks later, she was laying off 44 people — more than half of her company — and cutting salaries for the rest.
“I describe this time right now for all of us as ‘baptism by fire,’ ” Smilovic told her remaining employees in an email this spring, calling the pandemic “a crash course in economics.”
But it wasn’t clear then, or even now, when the fire might stop.
‘Showing People Who We Are’
Smilovic founded Tibi in 1997 after moving from New York to Hong Kong with her husband, Frank. She had been a marketing manager at American Express (where she met Frank). With no training in fashion, she and a friend started out making clothing for fellow expats.
In 2000, the Smilovics moved back to the United States and established Tibi in Manhattan. They are the sole owners of their company; in addition to the SoHo store, they have an outlet and warehouse in coastal Georgia, where Smilovic was raised, and where her mother works part time.
The bulk of Tibi’s business has always been wholesale. The brand is stocked at department stores (Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom), large e-commerce sites (Net-a-Porter, Farfetch), online tastemakers like SSense and popular regional boutiques like McMullen in the Bay Area. Its owner, Sherri McMullen, said Smilovic visits her store every year to meet with customers.
“She gets in the dressing room with them, tucking and untucking and scrunching up sleeves,” McMullen said. “She does it with such ease that women feel connected to her, like they know her.”
Beginning in late March, weeks went by without payments from some of Tibi’s stores, Smilovic said. When the layoffs came, the only team Tibi kept intact was finance, which scrambled to secure government support, renegotiate bills and rent — Smilovic’s single biggest source of stress at the time — and rigidly monitor cash flow amid the wave of bankruptcies and order cancellations.
She spent April crunching numbers, “gripped with fear,” she said. In May, when some stores and offices reopened, that fear ebbed slightly. She’d signed a fashion-industry open letter calling for a more sensible seasonal shopping calendar. She felt good that Tibi had donated 1,300 pieces of clothing to front-line workers.
She was also inspired to work on Tibi’s internal stylebook, articulating the rules for the creative pragmatist’s wardrobe, which she’d been sharing during the live styling sessions and on her own blunt Instagram account. Like: The best pieces can adapt from work to home to evening to weekend. A good outfit has three textures. Don’t match your shoes to your top. Don’t wear skinny jeans with stilettos.
“It’s showing people who we are,” she said on a Zoom call in May. “I don’t know where or how it will pay off, but it feels like the right thing to do.”
Then, on May 25, George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, catalyzing Black Lives Matter protests across the country. Some of those reopened stores closed again, boarding up windows to prevent vandalism.
On social media, Smilovic is far more candid than most creative directors in fashion. But during that first weekend of protests, she hesitated. She felt traumatized by what she was seeing on TV, she said, and wanted to wait until Monday, when she could talk to her team. Nine of Tibi’s 43 employees are Black.
Then, early that Monday, Smilovic learned the Tibi store had been robbed while a protest unfolded near SoHo, its front window smashed in with a crowbar. She left her home in Greenwich, Connecticut, to survey the damage.
“I thought that when I drove up I would be filled with rage or anger,” she said. Instead, it felt more surreal and sad. She posted a picture of the window to Instagram with the words “I’m processing.”
The immediate comments were largely sympathetic, which made Smilovic feel uncomfortable. “I was the last person in the world that needed to be consoled,” she said. A handful of people left critical comments, too, about how Black lives mattered more than clothing. Smilovic deleted the photo.
In a statement she made after gathering her thoughts and talking to Black colleagues and friends in fashion, including McMullen, she promised to devote space in Tibi’s SoHo store to a rotation of young Black designers.
In the meantime, Tibi’s financial outlook worsened by the week.
“We just put a million dollars’ worth of spring inventory back into our company books,” Smilovic said during a dejected call in mid-June. “Stores in the U.S. are like: ‘There’s no way I’m taking it.’
“The supply side is hurt. The demand side is hurt. My God, the last week and a half on top of it. At least before, there was an enemy that we could all acknowledge and fight. The enemy right now is just breaking people apart.”
A ‘Prints Brand’ No More
Though far from bubbly, Smilovic isn’t a pessimist, and as the summer dragged on, she began seeing some silver linings in Tibi’s sales.
A pair of $395 nylon joggers developed a cult following, selling out during the first run of 110 pieces, she said. Sellouts were happening with some regularity, now that factory production had been reduced — cut in half at the start of the pandemic — and the live styling sessions were catching on. August’s online sales were 30% higher than the same month last year.
“To be honest, I think people are understanding our brand better,” Smilovic said. It was a feeling she’d been chasing for a decade. Tibi had a different look in its first 13 years, one largely built around pretty party dresses with no strange accents or androgynous silhouettes. Smilovic grew to hate those looks.
“I was so sick and tired of not being proud of my brand,” she said.
So in 2010 she decided Tibi would modernize to align with her own taste. A few employees weren’t on board and left. But the biggest skeptics were the retailers selling the line, like department stores that had decided Tibi was their “prints brand.”
The new (mostly printless) Tibi was harder to categorize. It didn’t help that the brand had never been embraced by the fashion guard, which Smilovic has often attributed to fashion’s warped gender dynamics. In a business dominated by women, she said, there aren’t very many female designers at the top, and even fewer praised in the pages of Vogue.
“If you were a woman, it seems you either have to be a socialite — Rosetta Getty, Gabriela Hearst, Tory Burch, with a serious last name — or maybe a movie star,” she said. “I don’t say that to take away from the Olsens. I really like the Row. But are any of the top male designers in America socialites or movie stars? No, they all kind of made it on their own.”
One unforeseen consequence of the pandemic is that Tibi has been freed from some of its more toxic wholesale relationships, like with stores that ghosted on payments, or with companies that proposed paying the money owed via payment plans as long as one year. (Smilovic said no.)
And don’t get her started on “exclusive styles,” which is when a store requests tweaks to existing items, like a skirt with a shorter hem. Sometimes the end result wouldn’t look like Tibi at all. Smilovic gritted her teeth and made them anyway.
“I would take the money, but it would tug at me,” she said.
Not anymore. When orders like those are produced and then canceled, it doesn’t mean just a potential six-figure loss. It means being stuck with clothing she didn’t like and didn’t want to sell on her own site — not after working so hard to refine Tibi’s aesthetic.
“It turns into this weird David and Goliath situation, where the stores are really just threatening the solvency of your business,” she said.
Cutting corners has helped. Recently Smilovic hosted a summer-camp-themed photo shoot for the spring 2021 campaign at her house, complete with a DIY set and her home cooking as catering. Frank, her husband, has been “sweeping up crumbs,” she said, like disconnecting unused company phone lines belonging to laid-off employees, saving thousands.
But there is tension, she said, when one-third of the company (finance) is devoted to making sure the other two-thirds (product and sales) don’t spend money.
Full salaries have yet to be restored. Tibi will likely end the year $2 million to $3 million away from breaking even, making this the first year Smilovic has had a loss, she said. But there is still a sense of hope that she can get Tibi back on track. A new track — the old one isn’t an option anymore.
“She’s in a position today to pull back and do what she believes,” said Robert Burke, whose luxury consultancy firm helped with Tibi’s rebrand years ago. “She probably will have a more profitable $10 million business than her old $30 million business.”
In August, sitting in her somewhat disorderly office, Smilovic was musing on what she wanted to wear in the future: pieces that act like attachments, turning existing garments into something entirely new, like a giant asymmetrical collar layered over a sweatshirt.
The ability to transform something quickly has never been more important to her. Rules will be broken, she said; loafers and sweatsuits designed for next spring will go into production now, simply because now feels like the right time to wear (and sell) them.
“I feel so much better,” she said. “Before, you were so focused on pulling yourself back up so you could bring back the team and be what you were. And now there’s no notion of that in our heads. This is what we are now.”

Election Day in America is Nov. 3, but in-person early voting began in earnest Friday in four states — including Minnesota, a key Midwestern battleground that both President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden visited to mark the occasion.
Biden gave a speech in Hermantown, Minnesota, near Duluth, after touring a union training center, while Trump planned an evening rally at the airport in Bemidji, a northern Minnesota city of 15,000 known for its towering statues of Paul Bunyan and his blue ox, Babe.
With the coronavirus pandemic limiting indoor gatherings, elections administrators have urged voters to cast ballots either by mail or in person before Election Day. States already have seen record numbers of absentee ballot requests, and officials expect unpredecented levels of voter participation before Nov. 3.
Biden, whose trip was timed to coincide with the beginning of Minnesota’s early voting period, made just a scant allusion to urge people to vote now that they can.
“It’s time to take the country back, folks,” Biden said, as his speech drew to a close. “It’s going to start here, today, with voting in Minnesota.”
He then put his mask on and walked away from the lectern.
Trump, on Twitter, urged supporters in Virginia to vote as polls opened Friday. The president did not mention early voting in Minnesota, where he was planning to speak, or in South Dakota and Wyoming, states he is widely expected to win.
“Voting starts in Virginia TODAY, and we are going to WIN,” he wrote about a state in which his campaign has not bought a single television advertisement this election cycle, according to Advertising Analytics. “I’ll be having a Big Rally in Virginia, to be announced soon!”
Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota appeared at an event Friday morning to promote early voting with Sen. Amy Klobuchar and other top Minnesota Democrats in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park.
Walz said most of Minnesota’s early voting would take place by mail. He said he had received his own ballot but had not yet returned it.
“I think we’re ready. We’ve made the case that vote by mail, it’s safe and secure, but if you need to vote in person you can do that, too,” Walz said in a phone interview Friday. “It feels like there is a sense of calm around it.”
At a municipal voting center in northeast Minneapolis, voters waited 30 to 40 minutes in a line that snaked through an office park near Interstate 35W. The familiar “I Voted” stickers were replaced with a more precise “I Voted Early” model.
Darcy Berglund of Minneapolis said she had voted the first day that polls were open because she often travels back and forth to Iowa to care for her ailing mother.
“If she really takes a turn Nov. 2, I won’t be coming up here,” said Berglund, 60. “Even if I were in town, I’m so worried about this election. I just wanted to make sure I got my vote in.”
Several of Virginia’s elected Democrats, aiming to encourage their supporters to vote early, eschewed the traditional Election Day photo op for appearances at early voting sites.
In Virginia, Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner voted in Richmond and Alexandria, while Gov. Ralph Northam cast his ballot in Richmond, where he was the fifth person of more than 75 in line at 8 a.m.
CNN showed lines of more than two hours to vote at an early voting center in Fairfax County, a Washington suburb with more than a million residents. Some of the delays in voting may stem from social-distancing measures, which require people to space themselves out more than usual. But overall, the first day of early voting appeared to have gone relatively smoothly, without the kind of widespread complaints and disruptions that occurred in some states during their primary elections.
Kaine, who was Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016, wrote on Twitter — unsurprisingly — that he had voted early for Biden and Democrats down the ballot. “What a great day!” Kaine wrote, describing the experience as “easy” and “convenient.”
Northam said in a statement that “Virginians can be confident their vote is secure, and will be counted,” and urged “every Virginia voter to know their options and make a plan for safely casting their ballot.”
In most places in states that allow in-person early voting, early voting means going to a City Hall or a local board of elections, though some larger jurisdictions will arrange for regional early vote centers. The pandemic has brought even larger early-vote locations, with some major league sports franchises opening their vacant arenas and stadiums for early voting.
In 2012, Barack Obama became the first president to vote early, casting a ballot for himself at an early-voting site near his home on the South Side of Chicago. Trump has voted by mail, a process he has publicly denigrated, for recent elections in Florida, which he made his permanent address last year.

In January, artist Hank Willis Thomas began enigmatically summoning designers, musicians and activists he knew to his studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He was working on something big, bringing a force of history back to life.
“I didn’t even know why he was asking me to come by,” artist Wildcat Ebony Brown recalled. “It was a bit like a mad scientist-type of situation.”
In and out of the studio in those first few weeks of the year were loose groupings of luminaries like artist José Parlá; hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy; Rujeko Hockley, Thomas’ wife and a curator of the 2019 Whitney Biennial; Tariq Trotter (also known as Black Thought) of the Roots; restaurateur Tracey Ryans; Carly Fischer, a former researcher at the Whitney Museum; and Eric Gottesman, a photographer and Thomas’ collaborator on For Freedoms, an artist-led political action committee they founded in 2016.
Thomas said he wanted the Navy Yard crew — and eventually thousands of autonomous artist-activists around the world — “to set the tone for creativity, and the value of creativity in liberation, through community, through love and commemoration.” But first, he needed to share with them an obscure historical precedent, a story familiar almost exclusively to historians and Civil War reenactors.
Even before the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests that would come to define the spring and summer of 2020, Thomas had been inspired by another moment, 160 years ago, when a political awakening around racial justice, immigration and workers’ rights coincided with a high-stakes presidential election.
Entering his cavernous studio, visitors encountered whiteboards scrawled with notes, and an array of 19th-century images printed out from the internet — vintage campaign ribbons and banners, political cartoons, photos of young white men posing sternly in black capes and illustrated scenes of the men marching through the streets of New York and other cities, carrying lit torches.
“They looked a bit frightening to me. It looked like maybe a group of guys that I wouldn’t want to run into on the street,” Brown, the artist, said. “White men with torches. I mean, it kind of conjures up feelings of Charlottesville. But then you learn, like, Oh, no, actually they were abolitionists.”
The caped figures in the 1860s engravings adorning the walls of the studio were the Wide Awakes, a rowdy movement of young men (and occasionally women) who staged dramatic rallies in the streets of Northern cities. Under the banner of “Free Speech, Free Soil, Free Men,” they marched and sang and caused a scene, to whip up enthusiasm for the nascent Republican Party and its nominee for president, Abraham Lincoln.
Thomas first came across pictures of the Wide Awakes about a decade ago, and they remained in the back of his mind. In recent months, with Fischer, Gottesman and others, he started compiling more research, he said, with the idea of creating a network of makers and doers in the spirit of the Wide Awakes and “the nonviolent, entertaining, visionary work that they were trying to do.”
Like the Lincoln-loving boys in their matching capes, this new thing would have to be joyful. “If being civically engaged feels like a burden this season, we’re not going to have the level of impact we think we should,” Thomas said. “They’re called political parties . Let’s make it a party.”
The original Wide Awakes came about organically as well. In March 1860, a Kentucky abolitionist named Cassius Clay visited Hartford, Connecticut, to campaign on behalf of the Republican candidate for governor, and a small cohort of supporters accompanied him to and from his speech, carrying leaky kerosene torches and wearing oilcloth capes and caps to protect themselves from the dripping oil. The crowds were impressed, and the look caught on. By summer, there were clubs in virtually every major Northern city, parading in military formations by the hundreds, if not thousands.
Even many Northerners, however, were troubled by the Wide Awakes, particularly the existence of clubs of Black Wide Awakes in cities like Boston and Chicago. The Bedford Gazette of Pennsylvania, which operated halfway between Gettysburg and Pittsburgh, reprinted news of a Boston parade, alarmed by 100 Black marchers “right side by side with white men, and shouting for Lincoln!” The paper asked, “White men of Pennsylvania, can you, will you support such a party?”
More alarmed, of course, were newspapers in the South, which reported the Wide Awakes’ unarmed but well-drilled demonstrations as a menacing sign that the North was preparing to invade if Lincoln was elected. To defend against this imagined threat of violent radicals, places like Charleston, South Carolina; Augusta, Georgia; and New Orleans raised their own local militias called “Minute Men.”
When such tensions broke into actual war, after Lincoln’s inauguration, many of the Wide Awakes were among the first wave to join the Union army. And apparently the oilcloth was a perfect bit of infantry gear. One of the young Hartford Wide Awakes wrote home in 1861, asking his parents to send his cape, which he said “will be handy for rainy weather much more than a blanket, as they are the right shape.”
It was the capes that first intrigued Jerry, a Green Beret currently stationed overseas who asked to not use his last name because of his active-duty special forces status. Jerry had been a Civil War reenactor since the age of 9, but he learned about the Wide Awakes only a few years ago. “Looking at pictures of them, I think I was drawn to the fact that these guys looked so cool ,” he said.
Jerry felt strongly enough about the Wide Awakes — their devotion to the Union, their esprit de corps — that he got a tattoo based on their original banner, with an illustration of an open eye between the words “wide” and “awake,” above the year “1860.”
The image is a major set piece in a two-arm collection of American-history ink that includes the “Join, or Die” snake, the Liberty Bell, “1776” and the Civil War infantry bugle. His Wide Awakes banner is on the outside of his right forearm, right next to the Nathan Hale quote, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country” — in Arabic.
Sean Sullivan, another reenactor, who lives in Greenlawn, New York, on Long Island, has an identical tattoo on his left forearm. (The two men know each other but were until recently unaware they were tattoo twins.) Sullivan, too, is particularly taken with the Wide Awakes’ aesthetics.
The original Wide Awakes dressed in oilcloth to protect themselves from dripping lantern fuel, but c’mon, Sullivan said: “They probably just did it because it looks good with the reflections. You know, all the torches, they would march at nighttime, they would shoot fireworks. You read about how the light reflecting off of the oilcloth was really something that they liked.”
In 2018, Sullivan put together a handful of like-minded friends to do a reenactment of the Wide Awakes for the Remembrance Day parade in Gettysburg, held annually in mid-November in observance of the anniversary of Lincoln’s famous address. He was a driving force behind a small, private Facebook group of a few dozen who had been planning to march as Wide Awakes this year as well, but the parade was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
When told about the new Wide Awakes, Sullivan — who wore his own Wide Awakes T-shirt to a Black Lives Matter protest in Greenlawn in June — was delighted by “a movement to help create political and social changes, which is what the original Wide Awakes were doing,” he said. “I think it’s a group that Lincoln could get behind.”
Sullivan even got into a bar fight defending the original Wide Awakes’ honor at Remembrance Day last year. Two Confederate reenactors, “good old boys,” he said, spotted the tattoo on his forearm.
“They started verbally attacking me for being pro-Union,” he recalled. “Some of these Lost-Causer reenactors that feel the war is still going on, you know, ‘heritage not hate’ and all that stuff. They felt the need to get verbally loud with me. And it was a little intimidating.”
Sullivan sensed the conversation wasn’t going to end well, but also felt too tired and, at 35, too old to fight like he used to. When the waitress came by, he said, “I apologize.” For what, she asked. “For this.” And he poured the Confederate reenactors’ beers over their heads and ran out the door, then all the way back to his hotel.
Enter Thomas and his army of creatives, one of whom — Trotter — showed up to his first Navy Yard brainstorm, by sheer coincidence, already wearing a cape.
“Everyone was looking at me like, ‘Oh my God, how could you have known ?’” he recalled. “And I was like, ‘Yeah, you know, it felt like a cape kind of day!’”
On a clothing rack against one wall was a growing collection of prototypes for newly reimagined Wide Awake capes by designers including Brown, Anya Ayoung Chee, Kambui Olujimi and Coby Kennedy, whose zippered wrap has a colorful sheen inspired by the original oilcloth. On the whiteboards around the room, a constantly evolving group of diverse collaborators added to one another’s ideas for art installations, films, comic books, merchandise, fashion, musical performances and other initiatives and events. All under the watchful eye of the sepia-toned dead men from Hartford.
“There are so many challenges in our world that seem impossible to overcome,” Fischer said of the 1860 clubs. “And this group of energetic and excited young folks who gathered together and who made cool things and who wore cool things and who were inspired by one another, and imagined a different world — that is really central to so much of the work.”
As Parlá put it, “We sampled and remixed the Wide Awakes.”
A mission statement was drafted defining the new Wide Awakes as “a network of like minds who create in the name of liberation, artist sovereignty, and the evolution of society.” The group aims “to radically reimagine the future and enable self-emancipation.” What that has yielded in practical terms, so far, is a series of free-form happenings, including a Juneteenth celebration in Harlem; Fourth of July rallies in New York, Berlin and Chicago; an observance of the centennial of the passage of the 19th Amendment, at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn; and an appearance at the anniversary March on Washington. (Not to mention a flood of gorgeous Instagram posts.)
The pop-up nature of the events has meant that many people end up participating spontaneously. They dance to a DJ or drum corps. The children paint signs. People register to vote. Wandering by, they peruse artwork or sit in floral thrones constructed by Brown.
“People even told us, ‘I needed this. I’ve been alone and afraid,’” Parlá said. “Some of the traditional protests, the early protests, the air was thick with intensity, you know? And so we created this alternative way to protest, which was protesting through joy. Because I think what we realized was that we also needed it, and we wanted to give it.”
Over Labor Day weekend, the Wide Awakes returned to Grand Army Plaza for a celebration of Caribbean culture, on the eve of what would have been the West Indian American Day Parade. On the steps of the Brooklyn Public Library, musicians played and politicians spoke, and renowned Jamaican dancehall singer Sister Nancy crooned to a swaying crowd as the sun set over the plaza’s triumphal arch, with its engraved slogan “To the Defenders of the Union.” Tucked underneath, Abraham Lincoln sat on horseback, in bronze.
The collective is finalizing plans for a series of events Oct. 3, which is the 160th anniversary of the largest Wide Awake rally in New York. The 1860 predecessor will be tough to match. More than 30,000 Wide Awakes from across the country paraded up and down Broadway and Fifth Avenue, torches and fireworks as far as the eye could see. A live buffalo was brought from Kansas, and an elk from Minnesota. A miniature log cabin on wheels rolled through, as did a wood-and-linen replica of the White House lit from inside, and an ox-drawn wagon atop which a tall Lincoln impersonator was theatrically splitting rails.
The new Wide Awakes plan to be just as visible. When Alicia Keys performed on NFL opening night, she played before a huge video screen that was alight with images by artists affiliated with the Wide Awakes — including the iconic open-eye symbol they have adopted. The group promises to conjure all manner of creative joyousness leading up to the election, and beyond, with the guiding purpose being “liberation of mind, body, and spirit.”
As Trotter put it: “Throughout history, it’s been young people and creatives and intellectuals and philosophers and — just the visionaries — who understood the power in uniting and who contributed to the greatest progress. So what the Wide Awakes represent, in my mind, is that. The modern-day version of something that we’ve seen, at different points throughout history, emerge as it was needed.”

A journey for justice turned into a love story when Maya Moore, one of the WNBA’s brightest stars, married the man she helped free from prison.
The man, Jonathan Irons, walked out of a Missouri prison July 1 — more than 20 years after he was convicted on charges of burglary and assault. Irons, who pleaded not guilty, has insisted that he was not at the scene of the crime and had been misidentified.
Moore’s family met Irons through prison ministry in 2007. She visited shortly before her freshman year at the University of Connecticut, where she became one of the most heralded women’s basketball players in collegiate history.
“We wanted to announce today that we are super excited to continue the work that we’ve been doing together, but doing it as a married couple,” Moore, seated beside Irons, said Wednesday on “Good Morning America.”
The couple said they planned to continue to educate people about voting and to help others who had been wrongfully convicted.
“We’re doing our part,” Irons said.
Moore added that sometime in the spring she would have a “next step moving forward” concerning her basketball career, which she put on hold last year to answer what she said was a call from God.
When Irons first met Moore in prison, he was skeptical. He said he thought that Moore, 18 at the time, was at the prison for a token visit. But she wanted to hear his story.
She told him, “I’m here because I care,” she recalled in an interview last year with The New York Times.
In an interview last year, Irons called Moore a lifesaver who gave him hope.
“She is light,” he said. “Pure light.”
During college, Moore said, she began to consider Irons as she would a sibling. It was challenging to go to Missouri for visits, but they kept in touch. She sent him books by her favorite spiritual writers, and sometimes before her big games, they spoke on the phone.
It wasn’t until 2016 that Moore spoked publicly about the friendship between her and Irons, when she began championing changes in law enforcement and the legal system after a series of police shootings of unarmed Black men.
She became a strong voice for prosecutorial changes. She stunned the sports world when she announced in February 2019 that she would step away from her career in women’s basketball, in part so she could help Irons in what they thought would be his final appeal.
In March, Irons’ conviction was overturned by a state judge in Jefferson City, Missouri. Irons was 16 when the crime for which he was convicted occurred. He was prosecuted for burglarizing a home in a St. Louis suburb and assaulting the homeowner with a gun.
But there were no corroborating witnesses, fingerprints, DNA or blood evidence connecting Irons to the crime.
Prosecutors claimed that Irons admitted to breaking into the victim’s home, but Irons and his lawyers denied that. The officer who interrogated Irons did so alone and failed to record the conversation. Irons, who is African-American, was tried as an adult and found guilty by an all-white jury.
The judge’s decision hinged on fingerprint evidence that had not been divulged by prosecutors in Irons’ initial trial. Kent Gipson, Irons’ lawyer, argued that the state withheld that evidence, which could have shown someone else was responsible for the crime.
Irons was released from prison in July, nearly four months after his conviction was overturned. Moore sunk to her knees when he walked out. Soon after, they married.
A few years ago, when Moore came to visit Irons in prison, they both admitted they had strong feelings for each other. He said he wanted to marry her, but he said he also felt a need to protect her “because being in a relationship with a man in prison is extremely difficult and painful.”
In their hotel room after his release, Irons said, he knelt down and asked Moore to marry him.
She said yes.
“Over time, it was pretty clear what the Lord was doing in our hearts,” Moore said, “and now we’re sitting here today, starting a whole new chapter together.”

Clarinetist and 'Citizen Musician' Receives Avery Fisher Prize: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The New York Philharmonic's principal clarinet, and a leader in promoting racial representation, was chosen for the Avery Fisher Prize.
Anthony McGill, the New York Philharmonic's principal clarinet, hasn't been heard onstage at Lincoln Center since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly ended the orchestra's season in March. But he has been difficult to miss online, whether as the instigator of #TakeTwoKnees performances in response to the killing of George Floyd, or as a prominent voice in subsequent conversations around racial representation in classical music.
Those sides of his artistry -- as a captivating virtuoso on the stage, and as a longtime advocate for social change extending beyond it -- have earned him the Avery Fisher Prize, an honor that comes with $ 100,000, the Avery Fisher Artist Program announced on Tuesday.
Mr. McGill was chosen for the award last December; an announcement had been planned for April, with a celebration to follow in June, but both were canceled because of the pandemic. (The ceremony will now be virtual, and streamed Tuesday evening.) Still, his contributions this year to the Black Lives Matter movement have reinforced why he won the prize in the first place, said Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic's president and the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Fisher program, which is administered by Lincoln Center.
"I have the highest admiration for what I would call the citizen musician," said Ms. Borda, who as Mr. McGill's Philharmonic colleague recused herself from the award vote. "He is the embodiment of that."

Mr. McGill joins the ranks of previous winners, who in recent years have included the new-music champions Leila Josefowicz and Claire Chase, as well as the pianist and writer Jeremy Denk. Because an in-person celebration was not possible, Mr. McGill has been granted an additional $ 30,000 to donate; he chose the Juilliard School's Music Advancement Program, of which he is the artistic director and which seeks students from backgrounds generally underrepresented in classical music.
That extra money, combined with added gifts from Mr. McGill and Weston Sprott -- a trombonist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and the dean of Juilliard's preparatory division -- will be used to create a $ 100,000 scholarship fund.
"We're trying to ensure openness and opportunity for all kids, regardless of background, race, religion, sexual orientation," Mr. McGill said in an interview. "That's my No. 1 goal and passion."
Mr. McGill was the Philharmonic's first Black principal musician when he joined in 2014; he is currently its only Black player. He appears at David Geffen Hall and elsewhere as a concerto soloist, and is in a trio with his brother, Demarre McGill -- the principal flute of the Seattle Symphony -- and the pianist Michael McHale. In 2009, he performed at Barack Obama's presidential inauguration.

His hashtag #TakeTwoKnees -- which began in late May with a long Facebook post reflecting on George Floyd and race, accompanied by a video of himself playing "America the Beautiful" with a minor-key turn -- garnered tens of thousands of views across social media and prompted a wave of other performances in solidarity.
The Avery Fisher Prize would have been important to him any year, Mr. McGill said, but it's even more meaningful in 2020.
"I think about my history as a young Black boy playing clarinet on the South Side of Chicago and now this life in New York -- how can I help the next generation of young musicians succeed, too?" he said. "Maybe some kid from Queens or the Bronx, where I live, will see me or hear me play. It gives me such pride to think what they may think is impossible is actually very possible."

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Under normal circumstances, MetLife Stadium in New Jersey would have been awash in the blues and reds worn by the home fans. But against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, the New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers opened their seasons within the drab gray interior of the stadium.
There was a low hum of artificial crowd noise and music piped in to help recreate a semblance of a typical game. But the real sense of normalcy came from the outcome. The Giants, who had scraped together only 12 wins in their last three seasons combined, played hard for new coach, Joe Judge, but the Steelers’ superior talent ensured the visitors won, 26-16, in one of the most unusual games ever played in the Meadowlands.
No fans were allowed in under local restrictions due to the pandemic, and any tension that might have been generated by pregame protests against racial injustice and police brutality were met only by the sound of the national anthem.
About a dozen Giants players knelt during the song, and the Steelers held a banner that read “Steelers Against Racism.” Most of the Pittsburgh players stood while tight end Eric Ebron raised a fist.
And then the game went ahead. But even without the fans to help generate the energy that so many players feed on, many players said that once play began, it was almost business as usual.
“It’s a blessing,” said Saquon Barkley, the Giants running back. “We were still able to go out and play the game we love.”
But it was also a heavy struggle for Barkley, who spent much of the game absorbing hits and tackles in the backfield against a strong defense that was designed specifically to stop him. He had 15 carries for only 6 yards as the Steelers stacked their front line and then brought Barkley down.
The game was also the Giants’ first under Judge, and the first since two-time Super Bowl winning quarterback Eli Manning retired after last season. Manning’s replacement, Daniel Jones, looked much the way a talented second-year quarterback is expected to look. He made some excellent throws and runs, and showed command of the offense at times. But he also threw two interceptions, one of which turned the game on its axis.
It came 18 plays into an impressive third-quarter drive that began deep in Giants territory with the Steelers leading, 16-10. Jones improvised two good runs of his own and also completed a nervy 3-yard pass to the left, against the grain, to Barkley on fourth-and-1 to keep the drive alive.
But on the 19th play, with the Giants on the Pittsburgh 3-yard line, Jones rolled to his left with Steelers outside linebacker Bud Dupree bearing down on him with menacing intent. Jones made an ill-conceived pass attempt as Dupree appeared to make contact with Jones’ arm and the ball fluttered high in the air and came down in the arms of Steelers defensive tackle Cameron Heyward just inside the goal line for a touchback.
The lack of fans may have taken away the ambience from the game, but it may also have saved Jones from a showering of boos after that particular debacle.
“I’ll have a chance to go back and look at it and learn from it,” said Jones, who threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns to go along with his interceptions. “But I can’t make that mistake in those situations.”
The Steelers then marched down the field for a field goal that increased their lead to 19-6, and added a touchdown to put the game out of reach as they scored 23 straight points. Only a late touchdown by the Giants made the score appear more palatable, but Judge lauded the spirit exhibited by his players, even in an empty building.
“I’m proud of the way the team fought for 60 minutes,” Judge said after his debut. “That was something I really wanted to see. I wanted to see a team that played together for 60 minutes and fought regardless of score, circumstance or situation, and I saw that.”
Judge, the aggressive, tough-talking former special teams coach for the New England Patriots, was hired in January to replace Pat Shurmur after the Giants were 4-12. He ran a tough training camp but earned plaudits from players by joining in some of their team-bonding exercises, like diving in a puddle of mud during a fumble recovery drill.
On Monday, he also demonstrated solidarity with his players during the playing of the “Star Spangled Banner.” As he stood with a protective mask covering his face, he placed one hand on the shoulder of Jabrill Peppers and the other on the shoulder of Dalvin Tomlinson, who were both kneeling.
This is likely to be a transition year for the Giants, but the defense, one of the big question marks of the team — especially the injury-depleted secondary — showed some resolve against a Steeler team brimming with as much talent as optimism.
Pittsburgh is considered one of the best teams in the AFC, secondary to the likes of Kansas City Chiefs or the Baltimore Ravens as challengers for conference supremacy, especially with the return of Ben Roethlisberger, the veteran quarterback who played only two games last year before surgery in his right elbow.
Roethlisberger, who admitted to a heavy dose of nerves before the game, started slowly before finding his groove toward the end of the first half when he took the Steelers on a clinical eight-play, 78-yard drive in one minute, 25 seconds. He capped it with a 13-yard touchdown pass to James Washington.
Benny Snell Jr. ran for 113 yards on 19 carries for Pittsburgh and JuJu Smith-Schuster, the Steelers star wide receiver, caught six passes for 69 yards and two touchdowns.
Mike Tomlin, the Steelers veteran coach who guided Pittsburgh to an 8-8 record last season even without Roethlisberger for much of it, was delighted to see his team scrape away the rust and overcome the obstacles of playing their first game in front of an empty gray building.
“They generated their own enthusiasm and played with emotion,” Tomlin said. “They were just happy to play the game and I thought it was reflected in the spirit in which they played.”

DULUTH, Minn. — For a campaign event featuring Donald Trump Jr., the brash-talking, liberal-dunking namesake of the president, it was all rather mundane.
There was no large rally with thronging crowds, but a few hundred seats at a community center, each socially distanced. The signature Donald Trump campaign playlist, usually blared at a volume that makes conversation impossible, was replaced by a selection of library-level soft rock.
“I like the crowds a little bit more packed and a little tighter, but we have to play by different rules, and that’s OK,” he told supporters.
It was not supposed to be this way. If any state is positioned to go from blue to red in 2020, to embrace the fullness of Trumpology and provide the president some much-needed Electoral College insurance, it is Minnesota.
The state’s northern and eastern regions have grown more conservative over the years, and Republicans won two House seats in the state during the 2018 midterm elections — a rare bright spot during an election characterized by an anti-Trump wave. Going into 2020, conservatives crowed that the issues that defined the state’s politics were straight from Trump’s playbook: in particular, a robust refugee relocation program that has inspired a white backlash in certain places outside the Twin Cities.
This year, after the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, a wave of destruction gripped the city — exactly the type of urban unrest that Trump uses to stoke white fear.
“Try wearing a MAGA hat in Portland, Chicago, New York City, Kenosha, Minneapolis,” the younger Trump said to the crowd.
“They’ll kill you!” an audience member shouted out.
“There’s a reason we’re doing so well here,” the president’s son went on. “People have woken up. They’re sick of being lied to. And they’re sick of people who don’t deserve it being given the benefit of the doubt.”
At this moment, however, most evidence indicates that Trump is in a worse position in 2020 than where he finished in 2016. New polling from The New York Times and Siena College shows that former Vice President Joe Biden leads Trump by 9 percentage points in the state, more than five times the small margin that Hillary Clinton won the state by four years ago. And while Trump does enjoy the firm backing of conservatives in rural areas who support his law-and-order message, the same theme has not resonated with the larger coalition he would need to overtake the Democrats.
Biden’s advantage is driven by an erosion of Republican support for Trump in the state’s metropolitan areas, continuing the trend of suburban voters’ fleeing a president in crisis. In interviews, several of the voters reached for the Times poll, particularly those in suburban and rural regions that are bellwethers for the state, described rejecting Trump’s pitch about law and order and focusing on themes that Biden has tried to stress: decency, experience and Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Victoria Delgrande, an 85-year-old in St. Louis County in northern Minnesota, said she had voted for Trump in 2016 but deeply regretted that decision. Delgrande said she would vote for Biden in November.
“I was kind of hesitant to vote for him to begin with, but I thought he would do good for the country,” she said. “He has not. He has taken us backward. Oh, my God — I don’t even like talking about that man. Because he’s that bad.”
Sarah Cox, a 41-year-old social worker who lives in suburban Little Canada, Minnesota, said she thought that most people in the Twin Cities area had seen through Trump’s ability to stoke fear.
“There were a lot of people who voted for Trump in the first election who didn’t want a politician,” Cox said. “With Joe Biden, I think that he has that compassionate, sincere desire to help his nation.
“He knows if he goes too far left, he’ll lose people,” she added of the Democratic nominee. “He’s a moderate, and that’ll help him grab trust from both parties.”
In many ways, Minnesota Republicans often sound as if they’re describing a state entirely different from the one that has elected a mix of liberal, moderate and conservative pragmatists and reformers for decades. In the Republican version, violence and crime in major cities has ground society to a halt, and the November election will be a backlash to liberal lawlessness.
In Minnesota’s most competitive congressional district, the 7th, which covers the western portion of the state, Republicans have sought to link Democrats who have a more moderate reputation to the unrest in Minneapolis and to the city’s most controversial leaders.
The 7th district’s Republican nominee, Michelle Fischbach, premiered an advertisement Sept. 11 that seeks to tie the veteran Democratic incumbent, Rep. Collin Peterson, to Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Somali-born first-term progressive whose district is in Minneapolis.
This past week, in a message accidentally shared with Democratic colleagues and first reported by local media, a Republican leader of the state Legislature warned his caucus that “COVID issues are not our winning message, PUBLIC SAFETY is our ticket to the majority.”
Top Trump surrogates such as the president’s son, his daughter-in-law and conservative commentator Charlie Kirk have all visited the state or are scheduled to visit in the coming weeks. Several have used the campaign’s argument that Biden is not the moderate many know him as but a Trojan horse for far-left activists who will control his administration.
Florian Chmielewski, a 93-year-old polka musician who has gone from caucusing with Democrats as a member of the Minnesota state Senate to a full-blown supporter of Trump’s, said he believed that Republicans could ride votes from rural areas to victory in November. He attended the speech by the president’s son in Duluth.
“Minneapolis has been ruined,” Chmielewski said. “And in the last few years, Democrats have moved to socialism.
“He’s going to be big up here in the North and in the Iron Range,” he said, referring to the iron-rich districts of the northeastern portions of the state.
But polling from The Times and Siena College indicates that Trump’s edge with rural voters will not be enough to win statewide. Among suburban voters, Biden was the preferred candidate by 20 points, and suburban voters roundly said that the handling of the coronavirus pandemic — not law and order — was their top priority. That, combined with the edge that Democratic candidates have in the state’s population centers, was enough to surpass Clinton’s performance from 2016.
By 49% to 46%, voters said they preferred Biden to Trump on handling of violent crime, and Biden led by 15 points on that issue in the Minnesota suburbs. Biden enjoys a large advantage when voters are asked who is best suited to unify the country, one of the themes of his campaign. On that front, Biden holds a 17-point edge, with voters preferring him over Trump by a margin of 55% to 38%.
In a strategy memo from Biden’s campaign obtained by The Times, Biden’s advisers praised coordinated efforts with state Democrats, an area where Clinton’s campaign struggled in 2016. The memo stated that volunteers had reached more than 1.5 million Minnesota voters by phone and had completed nearly 5,000 volunteer shifts. Of particular note were state fundraising totals, which showed that Democrats had raised more than twice what the Minnesota GOP had from the start of the year through the latest fundraising disclosure deadline.
Valery Atanga lives in Rosemount, outside the Twin Cities, and said he planned to vote for Biden as a protest against Trump. Atanga said that Trump had worsened the racial divide in America at a time when he should have sought to unify the country.
“He says he’s the law-and-order guy, but I don’t think he is,” Atanga said. “It’s all about his ego. If he had a different tone, even with the protests, I think it would’ve gone different. The violence was because of him.”
Atanga, 42, said he believed that one reason that Biden was performing better than Clinton had to do with Biden’s perceived authenticity. He also mentioned sexism.
“Biden is a less controversial figure,” he said, adding of Clinton, “Being a woman, even if people didn’t mention it outrightly, that mattered. But Biden has appealed to the average American, and you can relate with him. I don’t think the average American related to Hillary. She didn’t come across as real. Not at all.”
Biden’s campaign announced this past week that the candidate would visit Minnesota in the coming days, a sign that maintaining an edge in the Midwest remained one of the campaign’s top priorities even with a reduced travel schedule. Last week, Jill Biden, the candidate’s wife, hosted in-person events on her Back to School Tour, during which she was joined by several Democratic state leaders, educators and parents. In contrast to Republicans, her message, targeted to the suburbs, made no mention of law and order. Instead, she described a Minnesota hamstrung by the coronavirus and an ill-prepared presidential administration.
“If the doctors are telling us we need to shut down, we need to shut down,” she said in Prior Lake, a suburb about 30 minutes south of the Twin Cities. “There’s nothing more precious than America’s children, and we should keep them all safe.”
She refused to comment on the younger Trump’s appearance in Duluth, although he made no such attempts at deference. In a speech lasting more than 30 minutes, he impugned the former vice president’s mental fitness (“Is he going to be awake for the next Benghazi?”), made little mention of the pandemic (“We’re all fed up with the quarantine nonsense”) and attempted a joke about how Bill Clinton would rather kill himself than be stuck at home with his wife.
Delgrande, the voter from northern Minnesota who backed Trump in 2016, said that those were the types of messages that once motivated her but no longer had the same appeal.
“I don’t think Biden is pure or this knight in shining armor,” she said. “I kind of think he’s too old to be running. But I’d vote for anyone above Trump. He lied too much with this virus. He never told us! I would vote for a dogcatcher first. I have no choice.”

In Wisconsin Poll, Unrest Concerns Don’t Translate Into Surge for Trump

The key battleground of Wisconsin, which President Donald Trump carried in 2016 by talking up trade, the economy and doubts about Hillary Clinton, is now awash in deep concern about violent crime, riots and protests — but voters aren’t favoring Trump on those issues even though he is pushing them hard, according to new polling from The New York Times and Siena College.
Worries about law and order have become so prevalent in the state that likely voters in the Times poll said the issue was just as important as solving the coronavirus pandemic, the public health disaster that has fueled economic distress, prompted schools to operate virtually and led to more than 1,200 deaths in the state, according to a Times database of coronavirus cases.
Yet so far, Trump has failed in his attempt to capitalize politically on his inflammatory remarks about the unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where last month demonstrators burned a number of buildings following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Blake remains hospitalized after being shot seven times in the back during a confrontation captured on video and later broadcast online.
Nearly 1 in 5 Wisconsinites who said that riots in U.S. cities were a bigger problem than racism in the criminal justice system planned to vote for Joe Biden — even though it is Trump who is vowing a severe federal crackdown on violent outbursts.
Scott Lacko, a 55-year-old from the northern Wisconsin community of Eagle River, backed Trump in 2016 but will be voting for Biden this fall. The riots concern him deeply; he argued that Black people shot by police would have been spared had they followed instructions and said that “it’s sad to see these individuals continue to be placed on a pedestal.” But he said that Trump’s law-and-order push had not won him over.
The president, Lacko said, cannot be trusted to act in anyone’s interest but his own. He reflected a majority of Wisconsin voters in seeing Biden as a unifier of the country: 52% said they trusted him more to bring people together, compared with 39% for Trump.
“Trump certainly tries to take advantage of the situation and muddy the water,” he said. “I may not have agreed with some of the things Biden said, but at least he’s trying to bring people together and find some way through it.”
The poll found Biden leading Trump, 48% to 43%, among likely voters in Wisconsin. The 5-point margin is about half of what Biden’s lead was when the Times last polled the state in late June. Trump has narrowed the gap between himself and the former vice president in parts of the country as the economy has improved after the initial coronavirus shutdowns in the spring.
For more than a decade, Wisconsin has been among the most polarized and evenly divided states in the country, and the fate of its political candidates has hung on turnout. When Democrats in its two major cities — Madison and Milwaukee — turned out in big numbers, party standard-bearers like Barack Obama and Gov. Tony Evers won statewide elections. But when Democratic turnout in Milwaukee or Madison has been soft, Republicans have prevailed: former Gov. Scott Walker carried the state in three elections between 2010 and 2014, and Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes out of nearly 3 million cast.
In Wisconsin’s cities, enthusiasm is high. The poll found 81% of voters in the cities said they were “almost certain” to vote, compared with 69% of suburban voters and 68% of rural voters. These city voters are also far more likely to favor Biden over Trump to maintain law and order. The intensity gap, if it is maintained through Election Day, is likely to benefit Biden.
In Trump-era elections that Democrats have won, there has been a surge of voter turnout in heavily Democratic Dane County, which includes Madison — the state capital and home of the flagship University of Wisconsin campus. In April’s state Supreme Court election, nearly as many votes were cast in Dane County as in Milwaukee County, even though Dane County has less than 60% of Milwaukee County’s population.
Justin Lang, a 38-year-old software developer in Verona, just outside Madison, said he had already ordered his absentee ballot to vote by mail for Biden.
“One hundred percent,” he said, when asked how certain he was that he would vote. “I don’t know that everyone is gung ho about Joe Biden in particular, but there’s a shared feeling across the board that Trumpism is a big problem. And that we need to get in there and vote to repudiate that.”
He added, “Within my social group, that’s going to be a big thing.”
The swing region of the state is the Fox Valley, a collection of small cities and rural areas stretching south from Green Bay. Andrew Fox, 38, an Iraq War veteran from Menasha, a community of 18,000 on the northern tip of Lake Winnebago, said he was not a fan of either major presidential candidate but was inclined to stick with Trump.
“I’m kind of stuck with Trump at this point,” Fox said, comparing his choice to “two bags of crap — cow and dog.”
In Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington counties, the state’s longtime conservative suburban heartland that adjoins Milwaukee to the west and north, Republican margins have slipped during the Trump era from where they were when George W. Bush and Mitt Romney were on presidential ballots. The Times poll found that in those three counties, Trump was leading Biden, 54% to 37% — an erosion of support from 2012, when Romney won 67% of the three counties’ vote, and even from 2016, when Trump took 62% of the vote in the three counties.
Carl Bouxa, 54, an information technology consultant in a health care system, lives in Brookfield, a Waukesha County suburb, and said he would probably vote for Trump. “For me it’s more about the competency on the economy,” he said. Among Wisconsin voters, Bouxa was typical: 51% said they trusted Trump more on the economy, compared with 43% for Biden.
“Do you really trust him to be better at leading the country? And I really don’t,” Bouxa said of Biden. Referring to Trump, he said, “The other one might have his issues, but he seems at least to have more ability.”
The president retains a devoted following in rural Wisconsin, parts of which were longtime Democratic strongholds that swung hard to his campaign in 2016. Trump leads Biden, 51% to 37%, among rural voters.
“I am not on the fence,” said John Holland, 79, a retired manager for a plastics factory in Marshfield, a city of about 19,000 in central Wisconsin. He said he was enthusiastically casting his vote for Trump. “I think he’s doing a great job.”
Holland said that he had six lawn signs for Trump and that he had counted “only about two or three in our entire city” for Biden.
The recent unrest in Kenosha, Holland said, only made him and his wife feel more confident in their choice.
“I am 150% Trump right now,” said his wife, Theda Kasner, 82, a retired medical worker. “I have absolutely no use for the riots, the conflict that is going on. Tearing down the statues is absolutely destroying our history.”
Demographically, Wisconsin is akin to Ohio and Missouri — whiter, older and less educated than the national average, with a statewide electorate that has trended toward Republicans in the past decade even as major cities in those states have become more Democratic. Wisconsin retains a heavy concentration of Black voters, living mostly in Milwaukee and in the old Lake Michigan manufacturing hubs of Racine and Kenosha. Black respondents in the poll were nearly unanimous in their support of Biden.
Statewide, support for Black Lives Matter tracks with Biden’s voters: 49% have a favorable view of the movement, while 43% have an unfavorable opinion. The movement’s support is strongest among city dwellers (66%), people of color (72%) and young voters (85% of those 18 to 29 years old) — though more than half of independent voters and suburbanites also said they had a favorable view of Black Lives Matter.
Ashley Bailey, a 23-year-old Milwaukee woman who works for a social services agency, said the protests in Kenosha following Blake’s shooting had been a necessary rallying call for racial justice issues. Trump, she said, is incapable of understanding what it is like to be Black in America.
“I feel like he hasn’t taken it seriously,” Bailey said. “He doesn’t feel like it’s a real issue because he doesn’t have to deal with it or experience the prejudice that Black people face on a daily basis.”

WASHINGTON — Emboldened by President Donald Trump’s campaign platform of law and order, militia groups have bolstered their strength before Election Day by attracting military veterans who bring weapons and tactical skills viewed as important to the organizations.
The role of veterans in the newly proliferating militia groups — which sometimes are steeped in racism and other times steeped simply in anti-government zealotry — has increased over the last decade, said a dozen experts on law enforcement, domestic terrorism and extremist groups.
Although only a small fraction of the nation’s 20 million veterans joins militia groups, experts in domestic terrorism and law enforcement analysts estimate that veterans and active-duty members of the military may now make up at least 25% of militia rosters. These experts estimate that there are some 15,000 to 20,000 active militia members in around 300 groups.
But gauging the size of these groups is difficult and imprecise, because much of their membership is limited to online participation. The estimates are based on samplings of militia member data gleaned from social media profiles, blogs, online forums, militia publications, interviews, assessments from watchdog groups and news reports.
At least four recently formed violent organizations were founded by military veterans, and many high-profile episodes stemming from militia groups — the killing of a federal security officer in May in Oakland, California; a thwarted plan to incite violence at a recent demonstration in Las Vegas; and the violence during a 2017 protest in Charlottesville, Virginia — involved veterans.
Underscoring how the threat of violent domestic groups is rising with limited official oversight, the top leaders of the Department of Homeland Security directed agency analysts to play down threats from white supremacist groups, according to a whistleblower complaint released Wednesday.
While militias and other paramilitary groups have been historically hostile toward the federal government regardless of the party in power, many have turned their animus in recent months toward Black Lives Matter activists as well as local leaders who enforced restrictions to combat the coronavirus. A notable example was in Michigan, where protesters, some armed, stormed the Statehouse this spring in opposition to pandemic rules. Some have begun adopting the language Trump uses to preemptively cast doubt on the outcome of an election.
Militias have historically risen after periods of war, said Kathleen Belew, an assistant professor of history at the University of Chicago and author of “Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America.”
“We have seen veterans and active-duty members being recruited because they have operational skills that are useful,” Belew said. She described the estimates of how many veterans had been drawn to the movement as “deeply concerning.”
It is an issue that federal agencies have largely avoided. “The VA has no authority to enact or enforce policies regarding veterans’ memberships in any organizations,” said Christina Noel, a spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs.
One of the larger groups, the Oath Keepers, makes recruiting veterans and law enforcement officers central to its mission.
“As a country we have spent so long at war overseas that a small percentage of veterans, but a percentage nonetheless, has warmed them to the idea that the way to deal with political conflict is to engage in armed struggle,” said Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, a Seattle-based research center on far-right groups. “This is a dangerous indicator of where things may go.”
From the years after the Vietnam War to the mid-1990s, a small flurry of militia groups cropped up around the United States.
Frazier Glenn Miller, a former Army master sergeant who served two tours in Vietnam, created the White Patriot Party in the 1980s. Decades later, he was sentenced to death for killing three people outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas. In 1995, Timothy J. McVeigh, a former Army soldier who belonged to a right-wing survivalist group based in Michigan, blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children. McVeigh promoted the works of William Pierce, who ran a white supremacist group that once posted a recruiting notice on a billboard outside Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
But beginning in 2009, antagonism toward the presidency of Barack Obama, combined with a new crop of post-Sept. 11 veterans, fueled exponential growth in militia groups.
While the military strictly forbids its active-duty personnel from participating in hate groups, it is silent on militias and the role of veterans who have left service.
“Veterans are often looked at for their paramilitary skills, their ability to survive in the field as well as leadership skills,” said Daryl Johnson, a former senior terrorism analyst at the Department of Homeland Security. “They are proficient with weapons, which they often own.”
While many veterans who are deployed overseas return filled with gratitude to be back in the United States, others return with very different views, informed by their work in countries whose political systems they despise and fearful that such ideologies could infiltrate their own country.
“You see overseas how things can go wrong,” Johnson said. Fear of communism, Islamic law and Marxism permeate some veterans’ thinking. “They take experiences they have had overseas and transport them to the homeland and think there are all these threats,” he said.
In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security released an intelligence assessment warning that returning veterans who faced trouble reintegrating could “lead to the potential emergence of terrorist groups or lone wolf extremists capable of carrying out violent attacks.”
The report led to such an outcry from conservatives and one prominent veterans organization that the department deep-sixed it. “We used the term ‘disgruntled,’ so that terminology was insensitive,” said Johnson, who helped prepare the report. “We were trying to show they were susceptible to recruitment because of skills they learned. That is a glaring truth no matter who is offended.”
That same year, the FBI did its own investigation of extremist groups with a focus on veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan.
The Obama years were a growth period for these groups, many of them loosely tied to the Tea Party movement. Most notable was the Oath Keepers, formed in 2009 with a core notion that its members should continue to honor the oaths they took in the military and law enforcement agencies to defend the country, via their efforts in a militia.
Stewart Rhodes, a former Army paratrooper who served as a staff member for Ron Paul, then a Republican representative of Texas, “formed the group to encourage current and former military and law enforcement members to honor their oath against tyranny,” said Sam Jackson, an assistant professor at the University at Albany in New York who has written a book on the group. “But the focus of threats has changed to be antifa and Black Lives Matter and others on the left.”
The movement has accelerated during Trump’s time in office. In 2015, Brandon Russell, a member of the Florida Army National Guard, formed the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi group. One of its members, Vasillios Pistolis, a private at the time, participated in the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, bragging on social media about injuring people. (He was later kicked out of the Marines.)
After that rally in 2017, Joffre Cross III, a former private in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg and a member of the newly formed Patriot Front, was charged with multiple weapons felonies.
The “boogaloo” movement, a loose network of right-leaning, anti-government groups that seeks to bring about a second civil war to overthrow the government, has been around since 2012, when it was largely an online movement.
In June, Daniel Austin Dunn, a former Marine, was indicted in Texas for making violent threats toward police officers on Facebook and Twitter posts, in which he associated himself with boogaloos. Authorities found a cache of weapons at his house. This year, the FBI arrested an Army reservist and two veterans with ties to the movement for planning to incite violence at a Las Vegas protest. An active-duty airman affiliated with the group was also charged with killing a federal officer in Oakland.
A small number of veterans have joined ranks with left-leaning groups or groups not associated with the political right. A sniper who shot a dozen Dallas police officers in 2016, killing five, was an Army veteran.
The man law enforcement officials believe shot and killed a right-wing activist in Portland, Oregon, last month was an antifa supporter and a veteran; he was killed last week by police. But veterans with far-left views are small in number and tend to act outside any organized force — the antifa movement, for example, lacks the structure and leadership of a militia — according to experts in the field.
Many groups have proclaimed themselves as enforcers of Trump administration policies and, more recently, as protectors of businesses in cities with protests, often antagonizing those protesters. The confrontations with protesters have also dovetailed with actions to protest coronavirus containment measures, often with a side of conspiracy theories to generate new member interest.
A well-known group, the Three Percenters, focuses on anti-immigrant activities and targets leftists like members of antifa. A leader of a chapter in Georgia, Chris Hill, is a Marine veteran who leads regular field training exercises.
The United Constitutional Patriots, a militia that patrols the southwestern border with Mexico, has also attracted veterans.
“The militia movement traditionally hated the federal government,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “This has completely changed with Trump.”
As they have inserted themselves in cities with large protests, the groups have found themselves sometimes welcomed by local law enforcement. “We have militia groups that are inserting themselves into cities to, from their perspective, to fill a vacuum of law enforcement,” said Seth G. Jones, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “But they are doing things outside of the law to take law and order into their own hands.”
Mike Martinez, police chief of Arroyo Grande, California, said the militias were a concern. “Many militias have their own ideology,” he said. “Some are not pro-law enforcement, so it is always important for us to be aware.”
The end of the Trump era would not spell the end to militias, the experts agreed. “In the immediate aftermath of an election, I don’t see this ebbing,” Jones said. “In fact my concern is there will be a range of organizations that don’t support the legitimacy of a Biden president, and that administration will have to think about how to disarm militias. That will be a dangerous situation.”

In Oregon, a Year of Political Unrest Extends to Devastating Wildfires

MOLALLA, Ore. — Ralph Mitchell’s neighbors were fleeing. Ash rained from the sky. And outside Mitchell’s natural-medicine business, a police cruiser announced on loudspeaker: “This has been declared a life-threatening fire emergency. You need to evacuate the city.”
Mitchell was having none of it. He was staying.
“There’s already reports that antifa’s in town, going down the streets looting,” he said, echoing widely discredited rumors on Twitter and Facebook that left-wing activists had been systematically setting blazes. “I’m getting texts.”
Every natural disaster has its holdouts. But the political fear-stoking that accompanied a tumultuous summer of racial-justice protests in Oregon has become a volatile new complication in the catastrophic wildfires that pushed closer to Portland on Friday, as authorities try to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people.
Law enforcement officials across the state said they had been swamped with calls about social-media misinformation and begged people to “STOP. SPREADING. RUMORS!” In the line of fire, the swirl of rumors actually helped goad some people into defying evacuation orders so they could stay and guard their homes.
As a Level 3 evacuation Thursday urged people to “leave now,” an eerie stillness fell over Molalla, an old timber town of 9,000 an hour south of Portland, and the holdout residents girded themselves for two threats. One was the very real 125,000-acre Riverside Fire burning just east of town. The other was the imagined invasion of left-wing mobs and arsonists that multiple law enforcement agencies have sought to refute.
Residents who remained hosed down their roofs and soaked their lawns. They organized go bags of baby supplies and clothes, just in case. They scouted for unfamiliar cars on the roads.
“I’m protecting my city,” Troy McNeeley said as he stood in front of the 900-square foot home he shares with his son, his son’s partner and several cats. “If I see people doing crap, I’m going to hurt them.”
The rumors played into some conservative residents’ fears and anger over months of protests in Portland, where left-wing and right-wing groups have occasionally clashed.
On Wednesday, police in Portland warned protesters about lighting fires — a seemingly innocuous public-safety message that was followed by waves of rumors about arsonists and mayhem. Sheriff’s offices and fire departments already coping with wildfires that have consumed 900,000 acres were flooded with phone calls.
“We are inundated with questions about things that are FAKE stories,” the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office in Medford posted on Facebook. “One example is a story circulating that varies about what group is involved as to setting fires and arrests being made. THIS IS NOT TRUE!”
Law enforcement agencies in southern Oregon announced Thursday that they had begun to investigate whether the Almeda fire had been deliberately set. The fire has burned hundreds of homes around Medford and is tied to two deaths. But the police chief of Ashland told the Oregonian that there was no evidence pointing to anti-fascist activists.
In Molalla, news began to spread through large and active Facebook groups that serve as a town square and local newspaper — a place to share local information, requests for help, and in some cases, unconfirmed gossip.
As conversations churned away online, neighbors called and stopped by each other’s houses and businesses to trade new, unfounded reports: People setting fire to hay bales. A shootout that erupted after a landowner caught someone throwing a Molotov cocktail — the Clackamas County sheriff told The Associated Press there was no such report.
There have been some verified reports of looting and arson, although authorities have not pointed to any political connections. On Thursday, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office said two men were arrested on charges of attempted theft and burglary after one of them was spotted trying to break into a home in an area burned by the Beachie Fire east of Salem. In Washington state, authorities reported arresting a person Wednesday who was reportedly setting fire to a median in Puyallup, Washington.
Officials in Clackamas County, which includes Molalla, announced an overnight curfew Thursday, and Sheriff Craig Roberts said he was stepping up patrols in evacuated areas and urged people to leave.
“We understand people’s concerns about possible increased criminal activity in evacuated areas,” Roberts said in a news release.
The FBI said it had also investigated reports that extremists had set wildfires in Oregon “and found them to be untrue.”
Some of the misinformation that seeped like smoke across Molalla appears to have begun when two independent videographers, Gabriel Trumbly and his partner, Jennifer Paulsen, arrived outside town about 9 p.m. Wednesday to capture images of the immense wildfires.
They put on press vests and gas masks that they have used while shooting video of recent protests in Portland, then walked along the rural road near where Paulsen had grown up. Trumbly said one resident was out spraying down their property with water and another offered them something to drink.
They got some footage and photos of the flames before deciding to turn back, concerned about the size of the fire and the possibility that power lines could fall in the winds.
But as they returned into cellphone range, Paulsen went on to Facebook and Twitter looking for fire updates and came across a social-media post that was clearly about them, describing their gas masks and vests and suggesting they had gone up the road to start a fire. The person reported trying to follow their Volkswagen sedan.
One person replied: “Are you kidding me shoot em.”
Trumbly said he pulled off to the side of the road and called police to explain what he was seeing on social media and what they had been doing south of town. He offered to show the footage of what he captured. The couple was afraid that armed vigilantes might pursue them.
“They think I just burned their houses down, and they have guns, and they are angry, and they are scared,” Trumbly said.
With the fire continuing to advance, the holdouts were posing increasing problems for firefighters, who had to fall back themselves Thursday to an elementary school 4 miles outside the evacuation zone in Molalla.
“We still have a bunch of people that haven’t evacuated,” Todd Gary, a division chief of the Molalla Fire Department said as he leaned against a table in a classroom. If the wildfire surged into downtown Molalla, Gary knew that his firefighters would have to risk their lives to rescue the holdouts.
“Some of them, you can talk into leaving,” he said. “Others are saying, ‘We can fight this.’ That’s a scary thing.”
In Molalla on Thursday afternoon, firefighters had already gone door to door urging people to evacuate. Passing police officers blared their warnings and shared ominous updates about how quickly the wildfires could explode if the winds revved up and the weather turned.
Chuck McClaugherty said he and about a dozen neighbors had decided to stay to protect their homes from “crowds of looters out of Portland.” He listened to his police scanner as he stockpiled water and wet down his neighbors’ homes as a last line of defense.
“We’re staying put and watching for people who aren’t supposed to be here,” he said.
Patrick McDermott, 36, hitched up a trailer carrying his four-wheelers as his fiancée packed bags of clothing for their family and draped a surgical mask across their 17-month-old daughter’s face. McDermott was unnerved by what he called a “generational” outbreak of fires that have swallowed entire towns in Washington and Oregon.
But he said he and his fiancée had been watching reports of hooligans in black masks and hoodies pop up on local Facebook groups, and he worried that he was putting his home at risk if he left. He would go, he said, only when the town caught fire.
“You see what they’re doing downtown,” he said, referring to Portland. “It’s going to be a free-for-all. If I’m here and my buddies are here, that’s going to get stopped. This is what we’ve worked for our whole life. We’re not going to let anyone take it.”

WASHINGTON — With cheering crowds, inflated and false claims, and inflammatory partisan rhetoric, President Donald Trump has resumed the mode of politicking he enjoys most: entertaining his supporters at campaign-style rallies.
Standing in a sunset glow Tuesday night at an airport hangar in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Trump looked and sounded like the political candidate he was in the pre-coronavirus era. His playlist, featuring “YMCA” by the Village People as his inexplicable walk-off song, was back.
And so was he, as he resuscitated old obsessions, like the “perfect call” to Ukraine that ultimately led to his impeachment, and a stale riff about how his coveted border wall would keep undocumented immigrants out of the country — a timeless device, just like the wheel.
It was his latest stop in a tour that so far has included appearances at airfields in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona and New Hampshire. The campaign did not announce it was resuming the rallies. It simply started scheduling them.
But Trump’s preference for celebratory, in-person appearances is now running headlong into the issue he likes least: the restrictions of the coronavirus pandemic. In Nevada, where the president had rallies in Reno and Las Vegas scheduled for this weekend, both events were scuttled on Wednesday.
The Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority informed the tenants that lease the hangar there that the event Trump planned to hold on Saturday was in violation of the state directive limiting gatherings to 50 people.
“This has nothing to do with politics,” said Daren Griffin, the president and chief executive of the airport authority. “We would hold our tenants to the same standard whether it was a Democratic or Republican rally or any other type of gathering.”
Campaign officials said the Las Vegas event had also been canceled.
For months, Trump has been pushing to bring back his signature rallies and return to the campaign trail, and officials have always assumed they would stage such events again in the final months before Election Day, despite case numbers of the virus remaining persistently high across much of the country.
“People are ready,” said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign. “People are ready to return to a more normal life.”
On Tuesday night, for instance, Trump supporters gathered to hear the president speak, many of them choosing not to wear masks or practice social distancing as they chanted “We! Love! You!” They had signed up online for tickets, just like in the old days, and were given masks, temperature checks and hand sanitizer on site, which they were encouraged to use.
The campaign called it a “Great American Comeback” event. Despite North Carolina’s restrictions limiting outdoor gatherings to 50 people, thousands converged under the protected banner of political speech, and state health officials did not try to stop them.
Campaign aides handed out signs that read “This Is a Peaceful Protest,” a trolling reference to what they believe was a free pass given to the Black Lives Matter protesters who came together in cities across the country over the summer after the killing of George Floyd.
Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, defended the president’s right to hold rallies.
“People have a First Amendment right, if they so choose to express their political opinion in the form of a peaceful protest,” she said at a news conference Wednesday. “If you’re allowed to march in aggregate, you are also allowed to show up at a political rally.”
The airport crowds are smaller than the indoor arena events the president used to headline, but officials said the hangar setup required less lead time to organize and was often less expensive to stage.
“This is better than the arenas, I have to say,” Trump said Tuesday night.
“I get off the plane, I make a speech, I get the hell out of here,” he told supporters last week in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.
A spokesman for Trump’s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, said the return of the rallies was in line with how the president has treated the coronavirus since March.
“This president’s contempt for experts and willful disregard of science has led to the unnecessary death of thousands of Americans from COVID-19,” said T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman. “Joe Biden will always put the health and safety of the American people first, and we have countless examples for why the same can’t be said for Donald Trump.”
Other Biden officials said they thought the plan to conduct rallies would ultimately backfire, because “real voters,” including seniors, would be frightened by images of crowds not wearing masks or social distancing.
Still, Trump campaign officials said they liked the contrast the rallies created between their campaign and Biden’s. The events showed Trump surrounded by supporters in a way that underscored how small and remote Biden’s events felt, the officials said, while also sending a message that America is open again — something the president has been trying to do, without success, since March when he declared the country would reopen by Easter.
Trump advisers cited an added benefit to the return of the campaign rally: helping with “candidate maintenance” by giving the president a vehicle allowing him to vent.
But fighting with Democratic officials about their right to stage the events in the first place could be helpful to them, too, the advisers said, perhaps stoking the grievances of the president’s supporters.
The Trump campaign’s co-chair in Nevada, Adam Laxalt, blamed political retribution from the state’s Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, despite the fact that Sisolak said his office had no involvement in the planning, or canceling, of the Trump campaign events.
“This is unprecedented – to cancel an incumbent President’s campaign stop inside 60 days of a major contested election in a swing state,” Laxalt wrote on Twitter. “This isn’t over!”
In a statement, Murtaugh claimed that “Democrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters” and said that the president would still travel to Nevada on the dates planned. He did not say what Trump would do instead of the rallies.
Other states with restrictions on outdoor gatherings, like North Carolina, have allowed the Trump gatherings to go on despite the violations, because they believe they cannot limit their right to freedom of political speech.
In Michigan, where the president is scheduled to hold a hangar rally in Freeland on Thursday night, outdoor events are limited to 100 people and attendees are required to wear masks and maintain social distancing of 6 feet. Nevertheless, airport officials said they were preparing for up to 5,000 people to show up for the president’s rally, in a county that has had 2,520 cases of coronavirus and 129 deaths.
“With such short notice — we got notified Saturday morning that he was coming in and we met with Secret Service over the weekend — it has definitely been a challenge,” said James Canders, the director of the MBS International Airport.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, told CNN the event was “very distressing,” but her office was not planning to stop it.
“The governor’s office doesn’t make individual enforcement decisions,” said Tiffany Brown, a spokesman for Whitmer.

N.Y. Fire Department Replaces Name on Its Highest Award, Citing Racist Past

NEW YORK — For 150 years, the James Gordon Bennett Medal has been one of the highest honors in the New York City Fire Department.
Since 1869, the award has been given to firefighters who climb awnings to save families from burning buildings, or pull children from flames. Awarded annually for valor above and beyond the call of duty, it is akin to a Medal of Honor for the fire service.
But the medal was not named for a firefighter or a public servant. Bennett, who endowed the award in 1869 after firefighters saved his upstate home from a blaze, was the publisher of The New York Herald newspaper, where he pushed racist and segregationist views during the Civil War.
On Tuesday, the Fire Department announced it would strip Bennett’s name from the medal, citing his history of using racist language.
“Here we are as a department, giving a medal for the most outstanding act of bravery for the year, an award given to the bravest of the brave, and the name on the medal is someone who really stood for something else. Not bravery,” Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro said.
The award will now be known as the Chief Peter J. Ganci medal, in honor of the highest-ranking uniformed member of the department to be killed in the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001.
“I think we’ll go forward this way, and we’ll look down the list and see what other changes we need to make going forward,” Nigro said. The department’s medals and awards, he said, should be named for its members, not benefactors.
“We have no shortage of heroes in the department to name them for,” he said.
The change comes amid a national reckoning, as institutions across the country wrestle with uncomfortable histories. Dozens of statues, memorials and figureheads have been stripped this summer — sometimes officially, sometimes by demonstrators protesting the brutality of the police against Black men and women.
At Princeton University, trustees stripped President Woodrow Wilson’s name from the college’s storied policy school because of Wilson’s “racist views and policies.” In Albany, New York, city officials ordered the removal of the statue of Philip Schuyler, because he was a slave owner.
Even by standards of the 19th century, Bennett’s views were vitriolic. He leveraged The Herald, a Northern newspaper, to undermine Union troops and President Abraham Lincoln. Under Bennett’s tenure, The Herald frequently used racial slurs and advocated the secession of the South.
“The United States is in the midst of a Civil War. And James Gordon Bennett, to discredit the Civil War effort to unify the nation, employs racist rhetoric,” said Alan J. Singer, a professor at Hofstra University who has studied Bennett’s history. “That is unacceptable at that time and any time.”
Bennett’s memorial statue still stands in Manhattan’s Herald Square, and his name continues to circulate in the news industry, including through a well-known journalism scholarship.
Bennett’s racist past has been noted for years by the Vulcan Society, which represents the department’s Black firefighters.
“Every firefighter learns of the James Gordon Bennett medal since they’re probationary firefighters,” said Khalid Baylor, a retired firefighter and president of the Vulcan Society. “No one tells you about the background of James Gordon Bennett, and how he was a racist.”
“We are happy to hear that the name is to be changed,” Baylor said.
James Tempro, an elder member of the Vulcan Society and the first Black firefighter to be awarded the medal, first raised the issue publicly in 2017, and said he was debating returning the award because of its namesake.
The change is particularly notable in the Fire Department, which has for decades been accused of racial bias within its ranks. In 2007, it was sued by the Justice Department for racially discriminatory hiring processes. The department settled that suit in 2014 and has since been subject to a federal court monitor, ensuring more diversity within its ranks.
In 2017, several civilian and Emergency Medical Services workers at the department filed a lawsuit alleging racial bias. That suit is ongoing.
The change to the James Gordon Bennett medal, Nigro said, is “important for us because of the history that we have, and the changes that we have been making in this administration.”
Less than a decade ago, the Fire Department’s ranks were more than 90% white. Now, roughly 25% of the 8,000-strong force is Black or Hispanic, according to department figures.

Rochester Police Chief Resigns After Accusations of Cover-Up in Prude Case

The police chief of Rochester, New York, and several of his department’s highest ranking officials resigned on Tuesday in the aftermath of the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who suffocated after he had been placed in a hood by city police officers and pinned to the ground.
The resignations of the police chief, La’Ron D. Singletary, the deputy chief, Joseph Morabito, and, according to Mayor Lovely Warren, others in the department, came three days after state Attorney General Letitia James announced that she would impanel a grand jury to consider evidence in Prude’s death.
“As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character,” the police chief said in a statement. He later added: “The mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for.”
Officials in Rochester had not publicly disclosed the death of Prude, 41, until a public records request by his family revealed officers’ body camera footage showing his struggle, naked and hooded, to the public for the first time. Prude’s family in recent days has accused officials of covering up his death to protect the police officers involved.
Singletary denied any wrongdoing on the part of the officers, even as seven were suspended last week. As recently as Sunday, he vowed to work to improve community relations in the department “to prevent this from ever happening again.”
Singletary was promoted to chief last year after serving 19 years with the department. Just 38 years old at the time, he was among the youngest police chiefs in the city’s history.
“He’s been — his whole life — wanting to be a police officer,” his cousin, Karen Frazer Crawford, said at the time.
Warren announced the departures in a video call to the Rochester City Council. “The entire Rochester Police Department command staff has announced their retirement,” she said. The mayor said she had not requested the chief’s resignation, and said it followed “new information that was brought to light today that I had not previously seen before.” She did not elaborate.
The resignations are the latest development in an explosive week in Rochester since the release of the body camera footage and the revelation, in stark images, of Prude’s encounter with the police.
Prude arrived in Rochester by train from Chicago and to his brother’s home on March 22. He was behaving so erratically, paranoid and hallucinating, that his brother, Joe Prude, had him admitted to a hospital for evaluation. But Daniel Prude was released hours later, and early the morning of March 23, he bolted from the home and into the streets.
Officers found him naked and ranting; a witness said he heard Prude claim he had the coronavirus, then on the sharp rise in New York. He was handcuffed without incident, seated in the street. But when he began spitting and ignored orders to stop, officers pulled a so-called spit hood over his head.
Prude became agitated and tried to rise, and officers restrained him by pushing his head into the street and placing a knee on his torso, according to footage from the body cameras. He stopped breathing and his heart stopped beating. Paramedics revived him and took him to a hospital, where he died March 30.
Hours after the incident, Singletary told Warren that a person had suffered a drug overdose while in custody, Warren said last week. But a county autopsy report labeled Prude’s death a homicide caused by complications of asphyxiation in a prone position.
Protests have taken place in the streets since the release of the video. On Tuesday, Melanie Funchess, a leader with the Greater Rochester Black Agenda Group, part of the Black Lives Matter movement, learned of the chief’s resignation when she saw the news on her phone.
“Wow, he didn’t survive,” she said. “My question is, with him retiring, will a whole story come out?”

What We Know About the Death of George Floyd in Minneapolis

George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died May 25 after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer’s knee in an encounter that was captured on video and incited large protests against police brutality and systemic racism in Minneapolis and in more than 150 American cities in the weeks and months that followed.
The explosive footage, recorded by a bystander and shared widely on social media, led to community outrage; an FBI civil rights investigation; and the firing and arrest of the officer, Derek Chauvin. The Minneapolis Police Department also fired three officers who were with Chauvin at the scene.
In June, Chauvin, 44, was charged with second-degree manslaughter and second-degree murder, a more serious charge than he had originally faced. He could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison.
The other fired officers, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, face aiding and abetting charges.
After Chauvin’s arrest in May was announced, Floyd’s relatives called the charges “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.”
George Floyd was pronounced dead May 25.
On the evening of May 25, a man identified as George Floyd — not yet a household name — was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. He was pronounced dead at 9:25 p.m., according to the medical examiner.
The preliminary results from an autopsy found that Floyd did not appear to have died from strangulation or asphyxiation.
“Mr. Floyd had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease,” prosecutors said in a criminal complaint, which also listed “potential intoxicants.”
The combined effects of his conditions and the way the police restrained him “likely contributed to his death,” the complaint said.
Documents tell how a call about a $20 bill turned fatal.
Around 8 p.m. May 25, Minneapolis police officers responded to a call from a store clerk who claimed Floyd paid for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, the Police Department said in a statement. The police said the man was found sitting on top of a blue car and “appeared to be under the influence.”
“He was ordered to step from his car,” the statement said. “After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.” The statement said that the officers had called for an ambulance.
According to charging documents, however, the officers had tried to get Floyd into a police vehicle. Floyd struggled with the officers, “intentionally falling down, saying he was not going in the car, and refusing to stand still.”
Floyd began saying repeatedly that he could not breathe.
Chauvin eventually placed him in the police car with Kueng’s help. At 8:19 p.m., Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the passenger side of the squad car. Floyd hit the ground, face down, handcuffs still on. Kueng held Floyd’s back while Lane held his legs.
Chauvin lodged his left knee in “the area of Mr. Floyd’s head and neck,” the documents said, and Floyd continued to protest: “I can’t breathe.”
The day after Floyd’s death, the police updated a statement, originally titled “Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction,” to say that the FBI was joining the investigation after additional information had “been made available.”
A cellphone video shows the aftermath of the arrest.
Bystanders pleaded and cursed, begging the officer to stop. A paramedic arrived and reached under the officer’s knee, feeling for a pulse on the man’s neck.
The medic turned away, and a stretcher was wheeled over. Floyd was rolled onto the stretcher, loaded into an ambulance and taken away.
The video did not show what had happened before he was pinned to the ground by his neck.
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis said he did not know how the initial police statement, which described a “medical incident,” had come to be written, but he said he wanted to be “absolutely as transparent as possible.”
Additional footage, from cameras worn by two officers, shows a delayed medical response.
The FBI is investigating.
On May 26, Frey announced that the four officers involved in the case had been terminated. “This is the right call,” he said on Twitter.
The Police Department’s statement said that no weapons had been used and that the officers’ body cameras were recording.
Frey said he had asked the FBI to investigate, and in a statement posted on social media said, “Being Black in America should not be a death sentence.”
The same day, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said in a statement that the FBI was conducting a federal civil rights investigation.
Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, announced in June that Lane, Thao and Kueng had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder as well as aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
Chauvin, who had initially been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in May, had his murder charge upgraded to the second-degree.
In July, Floyd’s family filed a lawsuit against the officers.
Police used tear gas and other means to break up protests in Minneapolis.
After the release of the initial video, demonstrators poured into Minneapolis streets for several nights to protest Floyd’s death.
Officers used tear gas and fired rubber bullets into the crowds.
Images on television and social media had captured businesses being lit on fire and people carrying goods out of a store that had been vandalized. Some demonstrators had gathered at the house of Chauvin and the house of the local prosecutor, according to The Star Tribune.
State officials said that a series of errors and misjudgments — including the Minneapolis police’s decision to abandon a precinct on May 28 that protesters overtook and burned — had allowed demonstrators to create what Gov. Tim Walz called “absolute chaos.”
On May 29, demonstrators returned to the street for a fourth consecutive night in violation of a curfew imposed by Walz, who activated the National Guard to help the police patrol the streets. Protesters had again overwhelmed law enforcement.
Minnesota’s top officials acknowledged on May 30 that they had underestimated the destruction that protesters in Minneapolis were capable of inflicting. The curfew did little to stop people from burning buildings and turning the city’s streets into a smoky battleground.
In total, a 5-mile stretch of Minneapolis sustained extraordinary damage. Not since the 1992 unrest in Los Angeles has an American city suffered such destructive riots.
Protests had also spread across the country to Los Angeles, New York, Boston and Louisville, Kentucky, where demonstrators protested the March shooting by the police of Breonna Taylor, a young Black woman who worked as an emergency medical technician. That shooting is also under federal investigation.
The case has drawn condemnation and comparisons to the death of Eric Garner.
As the video spread on social media, the arrest quickly drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, a Black man who died in New York police custody in 2014 after an officer held him in a chokehold. Garner’s repeated plea of “I can’t breathe” — also recorded by a cellphone — became a rallying cry at demonstrations against police misconduct across the country.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, had condemned the force used by the officers in Minneapolis.
“George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice,” Biden tweeted on May 26. “His life mattered.”
Days later, he addressed the nation in a brief speech from his Wilmington, Delaware, home and called on white Americans to confront the enduring inequities faced by Black Americans.
“The pain is too intense for one community to bear alone,” Biden said.
President Donald Trump had called Floyd’s death “a very very sad event,” and later tweeted that he had asked for the FBI investigation to be expedited, adding: “My heart goes out to George’s family and friends. Justice will be served!”
Trump later suggested on Twitter that protesters could be shot.
“These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump said. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!”
Walz said Trump’s tweet was “just not helpful.”
“In the moment where we’re at, in a moment that is so volatile, anything we do to add fuel to that fire is really, really challenging,” he told reporters.

Full text: In a video recorded from his hospital bed, Mr. Blake, who was shot by the police, says, "It hurts to breathe; it hurts to sleep."
KENOSHA, Wis. -- Demonstrations against police violence have been filled with the chants of victims' names: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner. In recent days, a new name -- Jacob Blake -- has been called out in protests across the country.
In that list, though, Mr. Blake, a Black man who was repeatedly shot in the back by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wis., is also set apart. Unlike so many of the people who have become grim symbols for a movement, Mr. Blake survived and has begun to tell his own story.
"Your life -- and not only just your life, your legs, something that you need to move around and move forward in life -- could be taken from you like this, man," Mr. Blake says from his hospital bed, snapping his fingers for emphasis, in a video released over the weekend. In the video, he speaks publicly for the first time about what happened to him. His injuries are severe, and his family says he was paralyzed from the waist down in the shooting last month.
In the video, which was recorded by an activist from New York who distributed it on social media, Mr. Blake describes his injuries, which he says left him with staples in his back and stomach.
"Every 24 hours, it's pain -- it's nothing but pain," Mr. Blake says. "It hurts to breathe; it hurts to sleep. It hurts to move from side to side. It hurts to eat."
Shermaine Laster, the activist, said he had showed up unannounced at the Milwaukee hospital where Mr. Blake is being treated and was meeting Mr. Blake for the first time.
For demonstrators seeking broad changes to American policing, the prospect of Mr. Blake's presenting the public with a personal voice to his experience was encouraging.
"My son is gone," said Monique West, whose 18-year-old son, Ty'Rese West, was shot and killed in 2019 by a police officer in Racine County, not far from Kenosha. "He's not here to tell nothing. There's only two stories -- either the officer or the person that's gone."
A Kenosha officer, Rusten Sheskey, fired seven times on Aug. 30 at Mr. Blake, who was trying to get into a car. The shooting was captured by a neighbor on a disturbing video that quickly drew outrage on social media. It set off sometimes destructive demonstrations in Kenosha and quickly became a topic in the presidential race, drawing visits from President Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Cortez Rice, a nephew of George Floyd, the man who was killed by the police in Minneapolis in May, said Mr. Blake's own words about what had happened to him would hold a unique value. "Jacob's got the chance -- he's going to get to speak," Mr. Rice said.
Gregory Bennett Jr. organized a community event on Sunday in Kenosha at which state lawmakers heard demands from residents for change. A seat was left empty for Mr. Blake at the event -- a reminder, organizers said, that he might yet be a voice for needed reform. Without such survivors, Mr. Bennett said, the stories are often muted.
"It would have been swept under the rug," Mr. Bennett said. "There's people whose family members have been shot and killed here in this city, and guess what? You never see a news camera or nothing."
To be sure, others who became symbols of abuse at the hands of the police have survived to tell their stories. Rodney King, who was beaten by Los Angeles police officers in 1991, and Abner Louima, who was tortured by New York police officers in 1997, both lived to describe what had been done to them. Mr. King, who died in 2012, and Mr. Louima, who started a real estate business in Florida, largely tried to move on.
Of people shot at by officers from the nation's 50 largest police departments between 2010 and 2016, about two-thirds survived, according to data obtained by Vice News.
"There's an invisibility to it," Frank Edwards, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Rutgers, said of people who survive police shootings, adding that many of those survivors are charged with crimes and rarely draw public attention or speak publicly about their cases. "They fear retribution if they do speak," he said.
What role Mr. Blake will choose to play in demonstrations remains to be seen. He still faces significant medical challenges, and one of his lawyers has said that his walking again would be a "miracle." Mr. Blake also is contending with legal charges.
By videoconference from his hospital bed, Mr. Blake pleaded not guilty on Friday to three domestic charges against him, including a sexual assault count. The charges were filed in July. On the day Mr. Blake was shot, the woman who reported the assault called 911, saying that Mr. Blake was at her home. The Kenosha police said they were trying to arrest Mr. Blake when the shooting occurred.
The trial in that case has been scheduled for November, although it could be delayed.
Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer who is representing Mr. Blake and has represented families of many Black people killed by the police, said Mr. Blake was still coming to terms with the public attention to what had happened to him and what that might mean in the months ahead.
"He hasn't been able to fully grasp what a symbol he has become," Mr. Crump said, adding that Mr. Blake was mostly focused on making sure that his young children -- three of whom witnessed the shooting -- are not traumatized and that they understand that he will emerge from this.
"The way he's trying to be a strong Black father for his children is the way that he's taking on the mission of this movement," Mr. Crump said.
Porche Bennett, an organizer with Black Lives Activists Kenosha, or BLAK, said on Sunday that there would be no pressure on Mr. Blake to publicly take up their cause or to become an outspoken advocate for the movement.
"We know we've got his support," she said.

WASHINGTON — After a summer when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets protesting racial injustice against Black Americans, President Donald Trump has made it clear over the last few days that, in his view, the country’s real race problem is bias against white Americans.
Just days after returning from Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he staunchly backed law enforcement and did not mention the name of Jacob Blake, the Black man shot seven times in the back by police, Trump issued an order Friday to purge the federal government of racial sensitivity training that his White House called “divisive, anti-American propaganda.”
The president then spent much of the weekend tweeting about his action, presenting himself as a warrior against identity politics. “This is a sickness that cannot be allowed to continue,” he wrote of such programs. “Please report any sightings so we can quickly extinguish!” He reposted a tweet from a conservative outlet hailing his order: “Sorry liberals! How to be Anti-White 101 is permanently cancelled!”
Not in generations has a sitting president so overtly declared himself the candidate of white America. While Trump’s campaign sought to temper the culture war messaging at the Republican National Convention last month by showcasing Black and Hispanic supporters who denied that he is a racist, the president himself has increasingly made appeals to the grievances of white supporters a centerpiece of his campaign to win a second term.
The message appears designed to galvanize supporters who have cheered what they see as a defiant stand against political correctness since the days when he kicked off his last presidential campaign in 2015 by denouncing, without evidence, Mexicans crossing the border as “rapists.” While he initially voiced concern over the killing of George Floyd under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis this spring, which touched off nationwide protests, he has focused since then almost entirely on defending the police and condemning demonstrations during which there have been outbreaks of looting and violence.
He has described American cities as hotbeds of chaos, played to “suburban housewives” he casts as fearful of low-income people moving into their neighborhoods, sought to block a move — backed by the Pentagon and Republican lawmakers — to rename Army bases named for Confederate generals, criticized NASCAR for banning the Confederate flag, called Black Lives Matter a “symbol of hate” and vowed to strip funding from cities that do not take what he deems tough enough action against protesters.
In effect, he is reaching out to a subset of white voters who think that the news media and political elites see Trump supporters as inherently racist. Trump has repeatedly rejected the notion that America has a problem with systemic racial bias, dismissing instances of police brutality against Black Americans as the work of a few “bad apples,” in his words.
“Trump is the most extreme, and he has done something that is beyond the bounds of anything we have seen,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “Playing with racism is a dangerous game. It’s not that you can do it a little bit or do it slyly or do it with a dog whistle. It’s all dangerous, and it’s all potentially violent.”
Aides said Trump’s actions were aimed at eliminating pernicious views that actually exacerbate prejudice. “President Trump believes that all men and women are created equal, and he will stand against anti-American philosophies of all kinds that promote racial division,” Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said Sunday.
Public views of Trump flow through a racial prism. A poll by CBS News last week found that 66% of registered voters believed Trump favored white people, versus 4% who said he worked against their interests. By contrast, 20% thought he favored Black people and 50% said he worked against Black people. Among Black voters, 81% said he worked against their interests.
In the poll, Trump led former Vice President Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger, among white voters by 51% to 43%, but trailed among Black voters with just 9% support, compared with 85% for Biden. Among Hispanic voters, Biden led by 63% to 25%.
The president’s latest order came as a book to be published on Tuesday by Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, describes a dismissive attitude toward nonwhite voters during the 2016 campaign. They were “not my people,” Cohen quotes Trump as saying. “I will never get the Hispanic vote,” Trump added, according to the book. “Like the Blacks, they’re too stupid to vote for Trump.”
The president’s approach in recent days seems to belie the Republican convention programming that sought to soften his image on race by featuring validators like Herschel Walker, the onetime football star, and Vernon Jones, a Black Democratic state legislator from Georgia, who testified to Trump’s friendship and his support for people of all races.
The president often makes the unfounded assertion that he has done more for Black Americans than any president other perhaps than Abraham Lincoln. He cites his support for funding for historically Black colleges and universities, his signature on legislation overhauling criminal justice sentencing and an unemployment rate for Black people that dropped to record lows on his watch, continuing a trend that had begun under his predecessor, until it rose again with the pandemic-related economic slowdown.
But analysts said the convention had been aimed at making it easier for white voters uncomfortable with Trump’s history on race to support him and that it might have appealed to nonwhite voters who bristle at the so-called cancel culture that has become a favorite target of the right.
Like other policies put forth with little advance notice, Trump’s focus on diversity training seems to have originated with something he saw on Fox News. On Tuesday night, Tucker Carlson interviewed Christopher F. Rufo, a conservative scholar at the Discovery Institute who criticized what he called the “cult indoctrination” of “critical race theory” programs in the government.
“It’s absolutely astonishing how critical race theory has pervaded every institution in the federal government, and what I’ve discovered is that critical race theory has become in essence the default ideology of the federal bureaucracy and is now being weaponized against the American people,” Rufo said on the program.
On his website, Rufo identified six agencies that had conducted training sessions that he said asserted that America is inherently racist and promoted concepts like unconscious bias, white privilege and white fragility. At the Treasury Department, for instance, he said that employees had been told that “virtually all white people contribute to racism” and that white staff members should “struggle to own their racism.”
Trump’s memo Friday adopted much of this language, attributing it to “press reports.” The memo, signed by Russell T. Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said “this divisive, false, and demeaning propaganda of the critical race theory movement is contrary to all we stand for as Americans and should have no place in the Federal government.”
Trump wrote or reposted roughly 20 Twitter messages about the memo Saturday and Sunday that said the Education Department would investigate schools that use curriculum from the 1619 Project by The New York Times Magazine, an effort to look at U.S. history through the frame of slavery’s consequences and the contributions of Black Americans.
Critics said the president’s move was a transparent play for white votes with less than two months until the Nov. 3 election.
“To say antiracism is anti-American is to say racism is American, which is to say Trump wants white Americans to be racist,” said Ibram X. Kendi, author of “How to Be an Anti-Racist” and director of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. “And that’s precisely the point. He’s relying on manipulating the racist fears of white voters to win them over. Once white people lose those fears through interventions like trainings, Trump loses their votes.”
Rufo, though, said Sunday that Trump was pitting his America First narrative celebrating the nation’s heritage against what he called the Black Lives Matter narrative that America was founded on racism. “The president is framing the election for voters in these terms,” he said. “Do they want to preserve the American way of life or do they want to burn it down?”

Full text: Greg Harbut, the rare Black owner of a horse in America's biggest race, says the predominantly white sport must change. But at a moment of social unrest, others question why he is racing at all.
In any other year, Greg Harbut would be enjoying the achievement of a lifetime. On Saturday, he will watch his horse Necker Island enter the starting gate for the 146th running of the Kentucky Derby, a moment of pride for a family that over the generations has built its success in the thoroughbred business.
His grandfather Tom bred and owned a horse that ran in the 1962 Derby, and his great-grandfather Will once graced the cover of The Saturday Evening Post alongside the magnificent athlete he cared for, the great Man o' War.
But this isn't like any other year. Harbut is the rare Black horse owner in a sport that is among the whitest in America. Now, he is hearing calls that he should boycott America's most famous race.
With the Derby taking place at Churchill Downs, in Louisville, Ky., the city in which Breonna Taylor was fatally shot in her apartment in March, becoming a focus of the Black Lives Matter movement, a coalition of activist groups has called for a boycott of the race and its sponsors on Saturday.
Demonstrations are planned at the track, and Harbut and his team said civil rights activists had privately urged him to follow the lead of professional basketball and baseball players who boycotted their own games, and stay away from the race.
But how, Harbut asks, can he be expected to give up his hard-won seat in the owner's box beneath Churchill Downs's iconic twin spires? His grandfather Tom could not even sit in the grandstand to watch the 1962 Derby.
Harbut, 35, himself has endured slights that make him feel like an outsider in the sport. When he shows up in the paddock before a race, he notices the sidelong glances of fellow owners and gets the occasional query about what pro team he plays on or what movie he was in.
It happened last month in western Kentucky, shortly after Necker Island finished third in the Ellis Park Derby to earn a place in the Kentucky Derby. Not long after, he said he saw a tweet that summed up the novelty of Black ownership in horse racing: "To see African-Americans on a major race day is like seeing a unicorn."
"My grandfather bred the horse and owned part of him and, at the time, his role in what is one of the most prestigious races in the world was not acknowledged," Harbut said. "This is part of my family's legacy, and it is a chance to remind people on a big stage -- the biggest stage -- that horse racing history here begins with African-Americans."
He is disturbed, however, by the repeated shooting deaths of Black people by police officers and has watched as the protests in Louisville have turned their attention to Churchill Downs. Last week, more than 60 people were arrested at the track. More unrest is expected on Saturday, the biggest day on America's racing calendar and one that was postponed from the traditional May running date because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Things weren't always this way in horse racing.
An African-American jockey, Oliver Lewis, won the inaugural running of the Kentucky Derby, in 1875, aboard Aristides, trained by Ansel Williamson, who was born into slavery. In fact, in the years after the Civil War, Black jockeys dominated horse racing, winning 15 of the first 28 Kentucky Derbys and becoming celebrities much like today's N.B.A. stars.
Just as swiftly, however, Jim Crow laws and ostracism in the sport pushed Black riders out of the saddle and into the barns as manual laborers, or to Europe, where they were more widely accepted. Their history has been mostly erased over the last 100 years, but the virulent sentiment that made it vanish is very much alive in the sport.
In July, amid the widespread tumult over the death of George Floyd in police custody, Tom VanMeter, a prominent Kentucky horse owner and sales consignor, posted a racist comment on Facebook directed at the predominately African-American N.F.L.
VanMeter apologized, and industry stalwarts like the Jockey Club, among horse racing's oldest and most influential organizations, were quick to condemn his statement, while Keeneland, the racetrack and auction company, said he could no longer race or sell horses on its grounds.
But the incident also brought attention to the lack of diversity at the top levels of the sport. The Jockey Club, for example, does not have an African-American among its 128 members and has just five people of color among its 286 employees. Keeneland, which sold more than $ 627 million in horse flesh last year, also does not have a single African-American executive or board member among its leadership.
For generations, a representation of the annual Keeneland auctions has been the green-jacketed African-American grooms leading one horse after another into the sales ring, where white auctioneers on a platform singsong bids of millions of dollars to a sea of white faces.
"The optics are not great, and horse racing has a class system that is readily apparent," said Jason Wilson, who is African-American and the president and chief operating officer of Equibase, which serves as the sport's official database. "There are not any nonwhite people in our marketing materials, and when I go to a board meeting, auction or big race, I do not see a lot of people that look like me."
Wilson, a lawyer and former investment banker, blamed the insular nature of the sport for reinforcing the status quo.
The VanMeters' roots in the sport, for example, trace back more than 120 years, when Frank VanMeter owned His Eminence, who won the 1901 Kentucky Derby with Jimmy Winkfield aboard. Winkfield won the Derby again the next year, becoming the last African-American jockey to capture America's greatest race.
"There is a strain of racism that is part of the sport, but whether it is truly the dynamic driving things, I don't think so," Wilson said. "I think we really haven't given it much thought as an industry. To do so takes time, money and commitment. Instead, when there are openings, there's a tendency to hire the people you already know, and they are usually white and often related to you."
On June 3, when racing returned to New York at Belmont Park after having been shut down for 80 days because of the pandemic, Kendrick Carmouche joined more than a dozen jockeys in the paddock before the day's races to observe a moment of silence for those who suffered and were lost to the pandemic. Then, each took a knee in solidarity with those protesting the death of George Floyd.
Carmouche, the only African-American rider in New York, had organized the demonstration along with John Velazquez, a Hall of Famer who is considered an elder statesman in the sport. A few days earlier, Carmouche, 36, had posted an anguished and tearful video on Facebook.
"It is very sad to see what is going on in the world," Carmouche said in the video. "I have a white wife and two kids, and it's sad to see that it just never ends. It just never ends."
Unlike LeBron James or Doc Rivers of the N.B.A., Carmouche was speaking from a modest stage.
He is among a handful of Black riders working in the United States. He rose from the bush tracks of his native Louisiana to dominant stints in the Mid-Atlantic region at racetracks like Delaware Park and Parx Racing near Philadelphia. Five years ago, he arrived in New York and perennially finishes among the top 12 in the jockey standings.
His father, Sylvester, was a jockey and his original role model. But as he climbed racing's ladder, winning more than 3,271 races and more than $ 110 million in purse money, Carmouche noted that the trainers and owners were almost always white and the grooms who cared for the horses on the backside were predominantly Latino.
"I made it all the way to New York, and I have never felt any racism, maybe because I was raised to respect everyone no matter what they look like," Carmouche said.
He does not have a mount in the Kentucky Derby. In fact, while African-American jockeys dominated in the early years of the race, no African-American jockey participated in the Derby between 1921 and 2000, when Marlon St. Julien earned a place in the starting gate.
But Carmouche understands how important it is for people to see Harbut, along with his business partner Ray Daniels, in the paddock, especially at the Derby.
"We have to show people what is possible," Carmouche said. "The way you avoid conflict is you give people love and respect."
None of the three owners of Necker Island -- Harbut, Daniels and Wayne Scherr, who is white -- fit the profile of old-money, deep-pocketed thoroughbred owners.
Harbut is a blood stock agent, a sort of broker who buys and sells horses for clients in Japan and the Middle East. He met Daniels, a businessman in Lexington who was interested in thoroughbreds but did not know how to enter the business. Two years ago, they formed a syndicate in the hope of introducing more African-Americans to the sport. They bought a horse named Heavenly Hill for $ 16,000. The mare finished third in a pair of stakes races, won over $ 60,000 in 2019 and was eventually sold for $ 100,000.
Beyond the thrill of winning races, Daniels became interested in the rich history of Black people in horse racing. He saw an opportunity to enrich the culture of the sport as well as strengthen an industry that is vital to Kentucky.
"It's a great portal for African-Americans into what is a multibillion-dollar industry and one we have too small a footprint in," said Daniels, who has explained to local civil rights leaders the importance of participating in the Derby. "There's pretty conclusive data that inclusiveness wins -- it makes for a more creative business. Horse racing is setting itself up to fail if it chooses to continue to be an older white gentlemen's club."
In June at Churchill Downs, Harbut saw an opportunity to raise his and his partner's game: A colt named Necker Island was running in a $ 100,000 claiming race, which meant he was for sale. The well-bred son of Hard Spun had fetched $ 250,000 at the 2018 Keeneland Sale and competed against some horses headed for the Kentucky Derby.
Their trainer, Chris Hartman, suggested they join with another of his clients, Scherr, a retired teacher and wrestling coach in South Dakota. Third-place finishes in the Indiana and Ellis Park Derbys earned them a place in the most visible starting gate for bringing attention to African-Americans' contributions to horse racing.
Harbut and Daniels intend to make the most of it. Necker Island may be a long shot, but they know they have already won.
"This is a different kind of Kentucky Derby -- one held in September, not May, with no fans instead of 170,000 of them," Harbut said. "But we are here, and people will know my family's contributions to the sport. They will know how African-Americans built horse racing. And, hopefully, more of us will return to it."

Full text: This Labor Day Weekend is unlike any other in recent memory: Broadway and most of the city's live performance venues have been closed for nearly six months; museums have only recently begun to reopen; and unemployment reached alarming levels in April.
The coronavirus pandemic has ravaged all parts of the economy, and culture workers are among the hardest hit. Yet some have managed to keep their jobs -- and even thrive -- while others are still struggling or have pivoted to new roles. Now more than ever we wanted to reflect on those people who have devoted their lives to the arts in some fashion. They've soldiered on, amid the shutdown, to create some semblance of normalcy -- whether recommending a book, securing the grounds of an iconic cultural institution or entertaining children. Here are some of their stories. -- Nicole Herrington, Weekend Arts Editor
The Shoemaker
Phil LaDuca, 65, founder and creator of LaDuca Shoes in Manhattan
Before the pandemic halted live performance, LaDuca Shoes was, in the words of its creator, Phil LaDuca, "ready to explode on the scene."
His flexible character shoes, which grace -- and save -- the prized feet of Rockettes as well as Broadway dancers and actors, were to be seen in an array of productions this year, among them "The Eternals," the Marvel film whose release date has been moved to next year, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Cinderella" in London (pushed to next March). Also on the horizon? "The Music Man," with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, on Broadway.
Speaking recently from Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife, Fon, his voice was a mix of wonderment and dismay. The day that Broadway shows were shuttered, the couple were in New York for the opening of the new musical "Six." He had designed the boots for the six actresses who play the ill-fated wives of Henry VIII.
"We were two hours away from the red carpet for opening night when I received the call," he said. "Fon and I were desperate to get out of New York -- we heard rumors that they were going to stop flights. I was doing my Kurt Russell-Snake impersonation from 'Escape From New York."'
But while LaDuca did indeed escape, he hasn't stopped working. In the early days of the quarantine, LaDuca Shoes offered dance classes on Instagram Live. "I always want to stay positive," he said. "We did it out of love for the community."
He added: "I went through a two-week period of funk and depression. And then I said, no, we're going to fight. Let's not sit on the sidelines!"
The classes ended in August -- dancers, he said, have many more options now -- and the shop, on 45th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, has reopened for fittings and pickups. This summer brought a significant change at LaDuca Shoes: the LaDuca Palette, which features four new colors to accommodate more skin tones. He said the inspiration came from the Black Lives Matter movement, following the killing of George Floyd. He said it made him reflect on his own white privilege.
LaDuca, who arrived in New York from the South Side of Chicago in 1979 with a pair of suitcases and $ 800 in his wallet, had no help in the creation of his footwear and shop. The movement made him question "would a Black kid from the South Side of Chicago have had the same opportunities as me?" he said. "My answer is no. It made me realize I wasn't doing enough."
And LaDuca's aim is to do everything he can for dancers. He was one himself. A year after he moved to New York, LaDuca was dancing on Broadway in Agnes de Mille's "Brigadoon." Multiple injuries -- his own -- led him to start LaDuca Shoes about 20 years ago.
His favorite story involves a young woman from North Carolina who was in town for a Radio City Rockettes intensive. She left the shop with the Roxie, a hard-sole tap shoe LaDuca designed for the Rockettes, and the Alexis, "because you need to bevel," he said, referring to the signature pose. "The Rockette bevel is what it's all about."
She returned a year later -- and announced that she was a Rockette. "That, to me, is what LaDuca shoes is," he said. "I'm just concerned with how I'm going to keep evolving and helping dancers." GIA KOURLAS
The Bookseller
James Fugate, 65, co-owner of Eso Won Books in Los Angeles
It was the second week of the shutdown in March, and James Fugate, the co-owner of Eso Won Books in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, was recovering from the flu. He thought it could have been Covid-19, but he couldn't get a test to confirm. Paul Coates, the founder of Black Classic Press (and father of Ta-Nehisi), had organized a Zoom conference for hundreds of Black booksellers and publishers to talk about how they were going to keep their businesses alive in the pandemic. Fugate joined, but turned off his audio so no one could hear him coughing.
The event spurred a flurry of marketing for readers around the country to support Black-owned bookstores, especially now that they couldn't shop in person. "Suddenly we started getting 25 orders a day, and that really helped," Fugate said in a masked interview in late August, in the back office of his store on Degnan Boulevard.
But that boost was nothing compared to what was to come. On June 3, a week and a half after the police killing of George Floyd, Fugate posted a notice on Eso Won's website, apologizing for having fallen behind on filling the "overwhelming amount of orders" they'd received that week. "We never anticipated anything like this," he wrote.
Soon they were receiving 400 orders in a single day; "I thought, it's going to take two days for me to get all those done," he said. By the next day, there were 1,200 more. "Oh, no, no, no," he thought, "there's no way."
In Los Angeles, Black-owned bookstores are few and far between. Besides Eso Won, Fugate said he knew of only two others: Malik Books in nearby Baldwin Hills, and Reparations Club in Mid-City -- both predominantly African-American neighborhoods. "We've always had a cross-section of Los Angeles come to our store," he said. "Our growth is in part due to our long record."
Most foot traffic still consists of South Los Angeles locals, but lately the majority of pickup orders are being placed by white customers from all over the county. "There are some knuckleheads around here who are upset," he said. "They're like, 'Why are all these white people coming here?"'
This Labor Day closes out a summer that saw the greatest period of growth in the store's 30-year history. Fugate has been a bookseller all his life; he discovered his passion for the industry as a teenager, in copies of Publishers Weekly borrowed from his local library in Detroit. Now in his 60s, Fugate still processes and fulfills every single online order himself. ("Sometime in June I said, 'Stop answering the phones. We cannot."')
But Fugate is grateful for the stress, and for his customers, who've by and large been understanding of the inevitable delays, and even lost transactions. He said he's "disturbed" to hear other bookstore owners complaining about the increased demand. "If you went from doing 20 orders a day to 200 orders a day," he said, "just be happy."
He also credits the American Booksellers Association for having developed a bulk ordering program to help stores like Eso Won handle higher sales volumes. Not all Black booksellers feel welcome "around all those white people" in the A.B.A., he said. "But to me, you want to be part of that bookselling community."
Since reopening Eso Won's doors on June 1, Fugate and the bookshop's co-owner, Tom Hamilton, have been worried about the virus; but Hamilton lets in only a few customers at a time, and asks that they wear masks and use hand sanitizer before entering. Store hours are now noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Saturday, but the owners are there much longer: from about 7 a.m. (sometimes earlier) until 5 p.m.
"Since the pandemic, it's like nothing we've ever seen," he said. "We have so many books, but they all seem to be selling.
"I think that's going to continue for some time," he added, referring to both the steady flux of orders in his inbox and the civil rights movement that is at least partly fueling them. "This isn't going to stop." LAUREN CHRISTENSEN
The Artist
Baseera Khan, 40, a Brooklyn-based artist who will be in residency at the Kitchen this fall
The artist Baseera Khan decided to film a cooking series for Instagram called "Apocalypse Cooking" in the days after New York began sheltering in place.
The videos were decidedly tongue-in-cheek, almost parodying Instagram as a medium ("look at all my toilet paper," "I still have cute nails"), that provided viewers with easy-to-follow recipes.
"'You don't need fancy things to make fancy food' was the theme," Khan said in a recent interview.
On March 26, Khan, who uses the pronoun "they," did a live cooking session on BRIC Brooklyn's Instagram page. And then, that day, Khan started feeling the symptoms of Covid-19. Immediately after filming for BRIC, they started getting the chills.
"So April was dark for me," Khan said, and much of their life came to a halt.
Almost overnight, the four art shows that Khan -- who uses a range of materials to create installation, collage, sound and performance art -- had lined up for the rest of the year, including one at the Atlanta Contemporary in Georgia and another at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Ohio, were canceled, postponed or left in limbo. And Khan said teaching positions evaporated. (In addition to teaching at the summer Masters of Fine Arts program at the School of Visual Arts, Khan also taught last year at Virginia Commonwealth University.)
With barely any money coming in and no health insurance, Khan resorted to rationing food. "I'd wake up in the morning and have coffee and a banana," they said. "And then for a snack, I would have tea and an apple. I would wait until around six to make a proper meal. Then I would just go to sleep really early so I didn't have to be hungry."
Every day, Khan said they would also try to register for unemployment benefits, calling the state labor department again and again with little success.
It wasn't until June 1 that they were finally able to register.
"It was all a really horrific experience," Khan recalled. "But then, at the same time, it felt familiar. Being an artist, you're either inundated with people and social activity or you're very alone. So there's an oil-and-water to it. It did feel familiar to isolate myself, to be honest."
In the summer months, Khan's circumstances slowly started turning around.
This fall the New Orleans Museum of Art will screen a film of their performance last year at the University of Albany. Titled "Braidrage," the work featured Khan scaling a rock- climbing wall that had been constructed with resin casts of the artist's body parts as the "rocks" and a floor-to-ceiling thick black braid as the rope.
Khan also started selling prints of their work on Instagram. And, on Sept. 8, Khan will begin a six week residency at the Kitchen in New York, where they will draw on their experiences in isolation and suffering from Covid-19 to create artwork in the form of a TV show.
"I'm doing the best I can in terms of not worrying," they said. "I don't know any other way." ALISHA HARIDASANI GUPTA
The Security Team
Elrige Shelton, 58, and Jervin Archibald, 46, chiefs of security at Lincoln Center in Manhattan
For the two chiefs of security at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, one constant in their lives before the pandemic was daily conversations with audience members as they patrolled the sprawling 16-acre campus.
Elrige Shelton, the late-shift security chief, remembers frequently greeting an elderly man who was a regular at the summer dance sessions known as Midsummer Night Swing in Damrosch Park. The man would always show up with a much younger dance partner, he recalled.
Shelton's counterpart during the daytime shift, Jervin Archibald, can picture an older woman to whom he always said "good morning" when she was on her way to work. She would greet him back: "Good morning, have a good day!" He never learned her name, but she was a constant who disappeared when the pandemic shut down New York City in March.
There were the Lincoln Center patrons who would stop by just to chat about the plays or operas that they planned to see.
"Sometimes people just need someone to talk to," Archibald said. "And you're there to give them an ear."
And then there were the harried ticket holders desperate to get directions for a theater before showtime.
"I couldn't walk 10 feet without someone asking me a question," he said. "Now no one wants to talk."
The Metropolitan Opera House and Lincoln Center Theater haven't hosted formal performances for more than five months, but the chiefs have been on duty the entire time, making sure the campus and its remaining population is safe.
Archibald, 46, who has worked in Lincoln Center's security division for more than half of his life, starts his shift at 7 a.m., calling roll and getting his staff up to speed before heading out to patrol the campus.
Shelton, 58, who has worked there for more than 25 years, takes over at 3 p.m. and stays until 11 p.m., when -- during typical times -- audience members are usually streaming out of the various theaters after a ballet or concert or play.
Before the pandemic, Shelton took an hour-and-a-half bus ride from his hometown in Pennsylvania to Manhattan; now, the bus no longer runs, so he drives instead. In March, when the pandemic was first bearing down on the city, he remembers that much of his job was making sure his security staff felt safe.
"At first it was a little frightening," he said. "We didn't want the staff to be fearful of coming to work."
Then, he had to usher them through a difficult furlough period. As of July 1, out of Lincoln Center's roughly 400 full-time employees, about 30 percent were on furlough.
For months, Lincoln Center's campus was entirely shut down. Neighbors were no longer permitted to stroll around or sit by the fountain. The emptiness was hard for Shelton, who was used to monitoring crowds of several thousands before showtime and afterward.
Archibald, whose father worked as a Lincoln Center security guard for 14 years, drives in every day from his home in Brooklyn. Earlier this summer, people who lived nearby told him that they were desperate for the grounds to open again.
"I miss the patrons, I miss my co-workers," he said. "I'm hoping for the day that we can all come back."
Then, in the middle of July, a partial reopening: The outdoor space opened to the public. Instead of theatergoers circulating on the campus, the outdoor areas are much more family oriented now, Archibald said. There are people walking their dogs, children riding bikes, older couples strolling through the plaza. For a couple of weeks, playlists curated by Lincoln Center employees and institutions like New York City Ballet played from the outdoor speakers on the plazas.
While the chiefs are still missing their regular patrons and colleagues, there are new people -- and animals -- who are becoming familiar passers-by. Shelton said that he has gotten to know a huge German shepherd named Mr. Pancake. He often sees an elderly couple who told him how they miss the New York Philharmonic concerts.
"I consider myself a people person," Shelton said. "So seeing the people come back, it relaxes me." JULIA JACOBS

She has enjoyed the heroine's spotlight in plays like Shakespeare's "Cymbeline" and "As You Like It." But lately Caitlyn McCain's most visible role is not onstage but online, where she is simply Miss Caitlyn, the effervescent host of Creative Clubhouse Stories at New York City Children's Theater.
"Covid definitely had me shift my mind-set a bit," McCain said, "although I've always seen acting and my work with young people in applied theater and education as kind of equally important."
When the city went into lockdown in March, McCain was appearing in "Five," a touring musical from this company. She was also its temporary gala associate, helping plan a fund-raiser that was soon canceled. Instead, she began to work with Nicole Hogsett, director of marketing and audience development, on "how we were pivoting our programming," McCain said.
The result was Creative Clubhouse, a web page of performances, reading recommendations, craft projects, singalongs and games. McCain, who had been an education apprentice at the theater while an undergraduate at New York University, proposed also developing Creative Clubhouse Stories, a series of livestreaming book-based classes for ages 3 to 8.
"Covid-related things is how we started," she said. "We chose books that explored boredom, anger, anxiety -- really big things that were probably coming up for a lot of little ones."
In the classes, Miss Caitlyn reads a picture book, introduces a related activity and discusses the theme. After hearing "Ravi's Roar," Tom Percival's story about a boy who has trouble controlling his inner (and here, literal) tiger, "one little human raises their hand and says, 'It makes me angry that I can't see my friends,"' McCain recalled. This led to helpful reflections on how Ravi tamed his own beast.
Although the story series is on hiatus until October, Creative Clubhouse features videos about each book. It also offers Start the Conversation, a resource for helping children deal with challenging subjects. The first installment, online now, covers race, racism and Black Lives Matter. It includes McCain demonstrating a stress-reducing exercise, as well as two videos she helped create: "You Matter," for families of color, centers on Christian Robinson's children's book of the same title. "Black Lives Matter," for white families, focuses on Anastasia Higginbotham's "Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness."
"I wasn't really interested in exploring 'We all matter' and 'We're all welcome here,"' McCain said. "That's been done." Instead, each video addresses specific concerns.
As artistic associate, a title she assumed on July 1, McCain is also developing digital programming connected to the theater's virtual season. In October, the company will stream a 2015 performance of "A Band of Angels," Myla Churchill's adaptation of Deborah Hopkinson's book about a girl's encounter with her enslaved ancestor and the founding of the Fisk Jubilee Singers at Fisk University.
McCain said her goal was to give audiences "the ability to adopt another person's point of view through their imaginations." LAUREL GRAEBER
The Coding Expert
Andy Carluccio, 22, lead developer at Liminal Entertainment Technologies in Springfield, Va.
At the beginning of March, Andy Carluccio assumed that when he graduated from the University of Virginia he would pay his dues at a software company and only later try to find a job that combined computer science and theater, his twin passions.
"I thought the kind of work I'm doing now would be the kind of work I'd maybe do in five years," he said in an interview.
But by the end of the month -- after the pandemic forced performing arts venues across the country to shutter -- Carluccio had been recruited by his mentor Eamonn Farrell to contribute his coding expertise to an online production of Caryl Churchill's play "Mad Forest" at Bard College. He was also plugging away at his undergraduate thesis.
Along with Farrell, who was working as the show's video designer, Carluccio was charged with reconciling the creative vision of the production's director, Ashley Tata, with the capabilities of Zoom's teleconferencing software. The success of that endeavor in April (the production was reprised in May to critical acclaim) and the skyrocketing demand for streaming content convinced Carluccio that he didn't need to complete an office job apprenticeship before striking out on his own.
"I saw the writing on the wall that this was my chance to jump in and do it now," he said. "I figured I wasn't even going to wait for the conferral of my degree." By May, Carluccio and his business partners, Jonathan Kokotajlo and Nolan Jacobs-Walker, had Liminal Entertainment Technology up and running.
In the few short months since its founding, the company has facilitated hundreds of livestreams for houses of worship, high school and university groups, children's theater organizations, Off Broadway productions and arts festivals from Carluccio's basement in Springfield, Va. He is modest about his team's role in these projects: "We think of ourselves sort of like virtual plumbers, routing audio and video across the internet from remote performers and technicians back to me to mix into a final livestream for the audience to enjoy."
During the spring it was not a foregone conclusion that theatermakers would be able to successfully pivot from live performance to creating compelling digital content. There were serious technical hurdles to clear and relatively few resources that artists and producers could draw on to make the switch. Some despaired, choosing to try to wait out the public health crisis.
"I created this company because I was saddened to see both community and professional theaters cancel their shows and close their doors because they felt the task of performing online was an insurmountable challenge," Carluccio explained. "I wanted to do whatever I could to make sure these works could continue and perhaps even thrive during a time when performing arts felt most needed but least accessible."
The rapid evolution that online theater has undergone in just a few months has convinced the young technologist that the hybrid art form is here to stay. "There are things that can be done by weaving together collaborators and designers over decentralized internet that I think has opened up design possibilities and audience interactions and scale in a way that we're not going to want to turn off once we're finally able to gather in person again."

The Comedian
Kerryn Feehan, 37, a stand-up comedian in New York City
Before the pandemic emptied the streets of New York, Kerryn Feehan had her hands full. She was working as a writer for Paramount Network and performing stand-up comedy several nights a week.
After the city went into lockdown, adjusting to life without live comedy "was really depressing," Feehan said in a Zoom interview. She kept busy with fitness and created a show on Instagram called "Cooking With Kerryn."
"I made toast for the first seven episodes," she said. "It's stupid."
Her first return to stand-up had its setbacks. In the early days of the health crisis, she participated in Zoom shows hosted by local clubs, telling jokes to "Brady Bunch heads" and viewers casually eating noodles on the other end of the screen. "Those were -- interesting," Feehan said.
She telecommuted for a few months before losing her job in May. Then she applied for unemployment benefits and took on side gigs.
Things started looking up soon after, though, as coronavirus cases in New York dropped and the city gradually began to reopen. Outdoor shows were cropping up in parks and on sidewalks, and Feehan was back onstage -- figuratively.
Now she is performing almost nightly, with clubs like Stand Up NY (which holds performances in city parks) and an outdoor, pop-up comedy show called Take It Outside.
"While the conditions aren't ideal, it's better than nothing," Feehan said.
Microphones often need to be sanitized, if performers don't have their own, and there's more pressure on the hosts to keep audiences engaged in between sets. The reactions from the crowd have also changed.
Watching a comedy show in a dimly lit club, where the spotlight is on the performer, allows the audience members more freedom to laugh at jokes others in the room may find insensitive or vulgar, Feehan said. "You laugh with abandon," she said. "You don't filter yourself."
Remove the shroud of darkness, and people become more apprehensive. "That's a challenge that has existed with every outdoor show, whether it's during the day or at night," Feehan said.
The adjustments can be quite humbling for veteran comedians, particularly those who have HBO and Netflix comedy specials under their belts and are now "performing on Orchard Street while a garbage truck goes by," Feehan said.
Naturally, there is no shortage of coronavirus jokes. Feehan would like to move on from them, but for now, that is all life has to offer. (One for the road: "My dad is an essential customer at Home Depot," Feehan said. "He's never leaving.")
Though she has consistent shows lined up, Feehan is aware that winter doesn't bode too well for outdoor comedy. She hopes the city will find a way to accommodate socially distanced, indoor performances -- whatever that may look like.
"The worst thing you can do is get rid of comedy shows," she said, calling the art form public therapy that encourages people to laugh at the strange times we live in.
"Comics," Feehan cheekily said, "are the frontline workers." SARA ARIDI

George Washington University said on Thursday that it was looking into a blog post, written under the name of an associate professor of history, saying she had engaged in a yearslong deception by assuming various Black identities even though she is white.
In the post, the author, Jessica Krug, wrote that she had eschewed her “lived experience as a white Jewish child in suburban Kansas City” and had assumed identities she had no right to claim. Those identities included “first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness,” she wrote in the piece on Medium, which was posted Thursday morning.
“For the better part of my adult life,” she wrote, “every move I’ve made, every relationship I’ve formed, has been rooted in the napalm toxic soil of lies.”
Her assuming of a Black Caribbean identity, she wrote, was “not only, in the starkest terms, wrong — unethical, immoral, anti-Black, colonial — but it means that every step I’ve taken has gaslighted those whom I love.”
Jessica Krug is the name of an associate professor of history at George Washington whose résumé includes prestigious grants and scholarly publications, along with articles in popular outlets like Essence and RaceBaitr, a website exploring race. Her academic work, including the 2018 book “Fugitive Modernities: Kisama and the Politics of Freedom,” focuses on the politics and culture of African and African diaspora societies in the early modern period.
Krug did not respond to emails and text messages Thursday, and the university said it could not confirm the authenticity of the Medium post.
“We are aware of the post and are looking into the situation,” Crystal Nosal, a university spokeswoman, said in an email. “We cannot comment further on personnel matters.”
But within hours of the essay’s being posted, there was a storm of reaction on social media, as some who said they had crossed paths with Krug, who was also involved in activist circles in East Harlem, expressed outrage or moved to disavow her.
Many drew comparisons to the secret life of Rachel Dolezal, who led friends to believe that she was Black and became the local NAACP president in Spokane, Washington, before her parents came forward in 2015 to out her as a white woman, causing a national uproar.
RaceBaitr said Thursday that it had removed Krug’s work from its website.
“Her charade has taken her into many Black sacred spaces, including this one,” RaceBaitr said in a message on Twitter. “We apologize for platforming her work and not taking seriously enough some of your warnings.”
Hari Ziyad, the editor-in-chief of RaceBaitr, wrote on Twitter that Krug was “someone I called a friend up until this morning when she gave me a call admitting to everything written” in the Medium post.
“She didn’t do it out of benevolence,” he wrote. “She did it because she had been found out.”
Krug’s scholarly work has won respectful attention. “Fugitive Modernities,” which examined the politics and cultures of fugitive slave communities in Angola and in the African diaspora, was a finalist in 2019 for two prestigious awards, the Harriet Tubman Prize and the Frederick Douglass Book Prize.
Yomaira Figueroa, an associate professor of global diaspora studies at Michigan State University, said in an interview that it was considered an “amazing book” and “field-changing.”
“I know a lot of folks who really respect her as a historian,” Figueroa said.
But last week, several Black Latina scholars started questioning Krug’s background, according to Figueroa, who declined to identify the scholars.
She wrote on Twitter that “there was no witch hunt, but there was a need to draw the line.”
Figueroa, who does not know Krug, said the scholars had begun questioning Krug’s identity after a discussion of novelist H.G. Carrillo, whose sister told The Washington Post after he died this year that he was not Afro Cuban, as he had claimed to be, but rather was African American. One of the scholars, Figueroa said, believed that Krug had also been lying about her identity.
In an essay published last year in Essence, Krug, who received her Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2012, called herself “boricua,” or Puerto Rican. She also called herself “an unrepentant and unreformed child of the hood” devoted to “the struggle for her community in El Barrio and worldwide,” a description she repeated in RaceBaitr.
Some who knew Krug casually in academic settings said her supposed Black heritage was more implied than directly stated. Chaédria LaBouvier, an art historian, said she had met Krug in 2017 when they both appeared on a panel at the Studio Museum in Harlem. In conversation, LaBouvier recalled, they quickly established that they shared some Jewish Caribbean background.
“She didn’t present herself as, ‘Oh, we’re two Black women,’” she said in an interview. “I thought, she’s probably mostly white, but in touch with her Afro Latina heritage, and wanting to be closer to that.”
Krug is also known in activist circles as Jess La Bombalera, which LaBouvier recalled her saying was “her salsa name.” (An announcement for a talk she gave last year described her as a dancer with KR3TS Dance Company, which caters to children and young adults from low-income and Latino families in New York.)
In a video of a New York City Council hearing about police brutality held on Zoom in June, available online, a woman identifying herself as Jess La Bombalera, “speaking from El Barrio, East Harlem,” with a Latina accent, decries “gentrifiers and developers,” as well as politicians who strike the “pose” of criticizing the police.
She also called out “all these white New Yorkers who waited for hours with us to be able to speak and then did not yield their time to Black and brown Indigenous New Yorkers,” according to an article about the meeting published by The New Yorker.
In the Medium post, the author wrote that “mental health issues likely explain why I assumed a false identity initially, as a youth, and why I continued and developed it for so long,” even though she said those issues did not justify her fabrication.
“I am not a culture vulture,” she wrote. “I am a culture leech.”
She wrote that she had thought about “ending these lies many times over many years, but my cowardice was always more powerful than my ethics.”
“I know right from wrong,” she wrote. “I know history. I know power. I am a coward.”
She added: “I should absolutely be cancelled. No. I don’t write in passive voice, ever, because I believe we must name power. So. You should absolutely cancel me, and I absolutely cancel myself.”

Pull Out of the Kentucky Derby? Pressure on a Black Owner Mounts

In any other year, Greg Harbut would be enjoying the achievement of a lifetime. On Saturday, he will watch his horse Necker Island enter the starting gate for the 146th running of the Kentucky Derby, a moment of pride for a family that over the generations has built its success in the thoroughbred business.
His grandfather Tom bred and owned a horse that ran in the 1962 Derby, and his great-grandfather Will once graced the cover of The Saturday Evening Post alongside the magnificent athlete he cared for, the great Man o’ War.
But this isn’t like any other year. Harbut is the rare Black horse owner in a sport that is among the whitest in America. Now, he is hearing calls that he should boycott America’s most famous race.
With the Derby taking place at Churchill Downs, in Louisville, Kentucky, the city in which Breonna Taylor was fatally shot in her apartment in March, becoming a focus of the Black Lives Matter movement, a coalition of activist groups has called for a boycott of the race and its sponsors Saturday.
Demonstrations are planned at the track, and Harbut and his team said civil rights activists had privately urged him to follow the lead of professional basketball and baseball players who boycotted their own games, and stay away from the race.
But how, Harbut asks, can he be expected to give up his hard-won seat in the owner’s box beneath Churchill Downs’ iconic twin spires? His grandfather Tom could not even sit in the grandstand to watch the 1962 Derby.
Harbut, 35, himself has endured slights that make him feel like an outsider in the sport. When he shows up in the paddock before a race, he notices the sidelong glances of fellow owners and gets the occasional query about what pro team he plays on or what movie he was in.
It happened last month in western Kentucky, shortly after Necker Island finished third in the Ellis Park Derby to earn a place in the Kentucky Derby. Not long after, he said he saw a tweet that summed up the novelty of Black ownership in horse racing: “To see African Americans on a major race day is like seeing a unicorn.”
“My grandfather bred the horse and owned part of him and, at the time, his role in what is one of the most prestigious races in the world was not acknowledged,” Harbut said. “This is part of my family’s legacy, and it is a chance to remind people on a big stage — the biggest stage — that horse racing history here begins with African Americans.”
He is disturbed, however, by the repeated shooting deaths of Black people by police officers and has watched as the protests in Louisville have turned their attention to Churchill Downs. Last week, more than 60 people were arrested at the track. More unrest is expected Saturday, the biggest day on America’s racing calendar and one that was postponed from the traditional May running date because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Things weren’t always this way in horse racing.
An African American jockey, Oliver Lewis, won the inaugural running of the Kentucky Derby, in 1875, aboard Aristides, trained by Ansel Williamson, who was born into slavery. In fact, in the years after the Civil War, Black jockeys dominated horse racing, winning 15 of the first 28 Kentucky Derbys and becoming celebrities much like today’s NBA stars.
Just as swiftly, however, Jim Crow laws and ostracism in the sport pushed Black riders out of the saddle and into the barns as manual laborers, or to Europe, where they were more widely accepted. Their history has been mostly erased over the last 100 years, but the virulent sentiment that made it vanish is very much alive in the sport.
In July, amid the widespread tumult over the death of George Floyd in police custody, Tom VanMeter, a prominent Kentucky horse owner and sales consignor, posted a racist comment on Facebook directed at the predominately African American NFL.
VanMeter apologized, and industry stalwarts like the Jockey Club, among horse racing’s oldest and most influential organizations, were quick to condemn his statement, while Keeneland, the racetrack and auction company, said he could no longer race or sell horses on its grounds.
But the incident also brought attention to the lack of diversity at the top levels of the sport. The Jockey Club, for example, does not have an African American among its 128 members and has just five people of color among its 286 employees. Keeneland, which sold more than $627 million in horse flesh last year, also does not have a single African American executive or board member among its leadership.
For generations, a representation of the annual Keeneland auctions has been the green-jacketed African American grooms leading one horse after another into the sales ring, where white auctioneers on a platform singsong bids of millions of dollars to a sea of white faces.
“The optics are not great, and horse racing has a class system that is readily apparent,” said Jason Wilson, who is African American and the president and chief operating officer of Equibase, which serves as the sport’s official database. “There are not any nonwhite people in our marketing materials, and when I go to a board meeting, auction or big race, I do not see a lot of people that look like me.”
Wilson, a lawyer and former investment banker, blamed the insular nature of the sport for reinforcing the status quo.
The VanMeters’ roots in the sport, for example, trace back more than 120 years, when Frank VanMeter owned His Eminence, who won the 1901 Kentucky Derby with Jimmy Winkfield aboard. Winkfield won the Derby again the next year, becoming the last African American jockey to capture America’s greatest race.
“There is a strain of racism that is part of the sport, but whether it is truly the dynamic driving things, I don’t think so,” Wilson said. “I think we really haven’t given it much thought as an industry. To do so takes time, money and commitment. Instead, when there are openings, there’s a tendency to hire the people you already know, and they are usually white and often related to you.”
On June 3, when racing returned to New York at Belmont Park after having been shut down for 80 days because of the pandemic, Kendrick Carmouche joined more than a dozen jockeys in the paddock before the day’s races to observe a moment of silence for those who suffered and were lost to the pandemic. Then, each took a knee in solidarity with those protesting the death of George Floyd.
Carmouche, the only African American rider in New York, had organized the demonstration along with John Velazquez, a Hall of Famer who is considered an elder statesman in the sport. A few days earlier, Carmouche, 36, had posted an anguished and tearful video on Facebook.
“It is very sad to see what is going on in the world,” Carmouche said in the video. “I have a white wife and two kids, and it’s sad to see that it just never ends. It just never ends.”
Unlike LeBron James or Doc Rivers of the NBA, Carmouche was speaking from a modest stage.
He is among a handful of Black riders working in the United States. He rose from the bush tracks of his native Louisiana to dominant stints in the Mid-Atlantic region at racetracks like Delaware Park and Parx Racing near Philadelphia. Five years ago, he arrived in New York and perennially finishes among the top 12 in the jockey standings.
His father, Sylvester, was a jockey and his original role model. But as he climbed racing’s ladder, winning more than 3,271 races and more than $110 million in purse money, Carmouche noted that the trainers and owners were almost always white and the grooms who cared for the horses on the backside were predominantly Latino.
“I made it all the way to New York, and I have never felt any racism, maybe because I was raised to respect everyone no matter what they look like,” Carmouche said.
He does not have a mount in the Kentucky Derby. In fact, while African American jockeys dominated in the early years of the race, no African American jockey participated in the Derby between 1921 and 2000, when Marlon St. Julien earned a place in the starting gate.
But Carmouche understands how important it is for people to see Harbut, along with his business partner Ray Daniels, in the paddock, especially at the Derby.
“We have to show people what is possible,” Carmouche said. “The way you avoid conflict is you give people love and respect.”
None of the three owners of Necker Island — Harbut, Daniels and Wayne Scherr, who is white — fit the profile of old-money, deep-pocketed thoroughbred owners.
Harbut is a blood stock agent, a sort of broker who buys and sells horses for clients in Japan and the Middle East. He met Daniels, a businessman in Lexington who was interested in thoroughbreds but did not know how to enter the business. Two years ago, they formed a syndicate in the hope of introducing more African Americans to the sport. They bought a horse named Heavenly Hill for $16,000. The mare finished third in a pair of stakes races, won over $60,000 in 2019 and was eventually sold for $100,000.
Beyond the thrill of winning races, Daniels became interested in the rich history of Black people in horse racing. He saw an opportunity to enrich the culture of the sport as well as strengthen an industry that is vital to Kentucky.
“It’s a great portal for African Americans into what is a multibillion-dollar industry and one we have too small a footprint in,” said Daniels, who has explained to local civil rights leaders the importance of participating in the Derby. “There’s pretty conclusive data that inclusiveness wins — it makes for a more creative business. Horse racing is setting itself up to fail if it chooses to continue to be an older white gentlemen’s club.”
In June at Churchill Downs, Harbut saw an opportunity to raise his and his partner’s game: A colt named Necker Island was running in a $100,000 claiming race, which meant he was for sale. The well-bred son of Hard Spun had fetched $250,000 at the 2018 Keeneland Sale and competed against some horses headed for the Kentucky Derby.
Their trainer, Chris Hartman, suggested they join with another of his clients, Scherr, a retired teacher and wrestling coach in South Dakota. Third-place finishes in the Indiana and Ellis Park Derbys earned them a place in the most visible starting gate for bringing attention to African Americans’ contributions to horse racing.
Harbut and Daniels intend to make the most of it. Necker Island may be a long shot, but they know they have already won.
“This is a different kind of Kentucky Derby — one held in September, not May, with no fans instead of 170,000 of them,” Harbut said. “But we are here, and people will know my family’s contributions to the sport. They will know how African Americans built horse racing. And, hopefully, more of us will return to it.”

If the Black Lives Matter movement has an anthem, it’s probably Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright.” Five years after its release, it’s still chanted en masse by demonstrators and blasted from car stereos at protests, fluttering in the air like a liberation flag.
Like many revolutionary anthems past, this one is the work of young jazz-trained musicians. Terrace Martin’s shivering alto saxophone and Thundercat’s gauzy vocals are as powerful as the track’s spitfire refrain: “Can you hear me, can you feel me?/We gon’ be all right.”
Martin, Thundercat and famed saxophonist Kamasi Washington came up together in Los Angeles’ Leimert Park scene, where Black music, poetry, theater and dance have blended for decades. Romantically, it’s the kind of place you’d imagine as the backbone of the jazz world, like Spike Lee’s Bed-Stuy of the 1980s or Dizzy Gillespie’s Harlem in the ’40s. But today, local scenes like this one are barely surviving. It’s the Ivory Tower, not the city, that has become the tradition’s main thoroughfare.
The music known as jazz grew up in New Orleans, in the decades after Emancipation, as Black and Creole people founded social clubs with their own marching bands. As it evolved, jazz remained a resistance music precisely because it was the sound of Black Americans building something together, in the face of repression. But at the end of the 1960s, just as calls for Black Power were motivating musicians to create their own publishing houses, venues and record labels, a new force emerged: Schools and universities across the country began welcoming jazz as America’s so-called “classical music,” canonizing its older styles and effectively freezing it in place.
This year, the pandemic and the protest movement against racial injustice have created a moment of enormous potential. Conversations about radical change and new beginnings have crept into seemingly every aspect of American life. But as jazz musicians reckon with the events of 2020, they have found themselves torn between the music’s roots in Black organizing and its present-day life in the academy.
The very institutional acceptance that many musicians sought in the mid-to-late-20th century has hitched jazz to a broken and still-segregated education system. Partly as a result, the music has become inaccessible to, and disconnected from, many of the very people who created it: young Black Americans, poorer people and others at the societal margins.
Of the more than 500 students who graduate from American universities with jazz degrees each year, less than 10% are Black, according to Department of Education statistics compiled by DataUSA. In 2017, the last year with data available, precisely 1% of jazz-degree grads were Black women.
“The education is the anchor,” saxophonist J.D. Allen, 47, said in a recent interview. “We should be questioning our education system. Is it working? Is there a pipeline into the university for indigenous Black Americans to play their music, and learn their music? I don’t think that exists.”
Over the past five or 10 years, a number of musicians have helped pull jazz back into the cultural conversation, usually with message-driven music. It’s no coincidence that, like Lamar’s colleagues in Leimert Park, virtually all of them come from strong city scenes and learned much of what they know outside of school.
That’s noticeable in the calypso futurism of London saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, and in the surrealist suites of Chicago-based flutist Nicole Mitchell and her Black Earth Ensemble. The markings of outsiderism are all over Georgia Anne Muldrow’s new album with her Jyoti project, “Mama You Can Bet,” full of dusty, sample-based jazz collages, recorded alone in her Los Angeles studio.
Raised by musicians in Leimert Park, Muldrow remembers feeling immediately affronted when she enrolled in the New School’s jazz program. “I was like, ‘What are you trying to teach people?’ I was the worst student of all time,” Muldrow said in an interview, laughing as she remembered that she hadn’t lasted a full year. “At the center of the teaching would always be the idea that jazz is not about race. And it absolutely is. It was absolutely about where people weren’t allowed to go, which made them travel in their music.”
Inspired in part by the Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) theater artists who this summer published a 29-page list of demands for their industry, and by the female and nonbinary musicians who formed the We Have Voice collective, Allen and a number of other musicians recently began holding Zoom meetings. The group, which includes artists on three continents, has titled itself the We Insist! Collective in a reference to the rebel music of Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln and Oscar Brown Jr.; late last month it released a manifesto and charter listing 10 demands for the schools and other institutions that compose jazz’s mainstream economy.
Educational institutions must commit to revamping their curriculums around an anti-racist understanding, the collective wrote. A Black Public Arts Fund must be created to help increase the representation of African American students in jazz programs. And educational institutions should work in partnership with “grassroots local community organizations,” recognizing where the music has historically grown.
“The story of jazz is that of the pursuit of Black liberation, and that liberation can only happen through the dismantling of racism and patriarchy,” the manifesto reads.
Black musicians have built institutions since before the word “jazz” was even used. In 1910, James Reese Europe organized the Clef Club, effectively a union and booking agency for Black musicians in New York with its own large ensemble. But as white audiences fell in love with the music too, white entrepreneurs stepped in to handle the record labels, the publishing companies and the best-paying clubs.
The civil rights movement progressed and white liberal audiences recognized jazz musicians to be some of the country’s great artistic leaders, but they rarely treated those musicians as the scholars and thought-leaders that they were. White journalists, historians and broadcasters reserved that job for themselves.
At the midway point of the 1960s, after releasing his masterpiece, “A Love Supreme,” John Coltrane started a large ensemble with deeply spiritual intentions; he was abdicating the throne as jazz’s mainstream hero, and moving beyond many critics’ comprehension. That same year, a collective of musicians in Chicago formed the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, supporting each other in creating new music and educating young people on the South Side. Months earlier, in a series of concerts known as the October Revolution in Jazz, musicians in New York had seized the gears of concert presentation, breaking with the clubs.
“I think the music is rising, in my estimation. It’s rising into something else. And so we’ll have to find this kind of place to be played in,” Coltrane said at the time, calling for musicians to lead the way through “self-help.”
Somehow, it was in this moment that jazz programs began to spring up in academia, declaring the music’s history basically complete and assembling rigid curriculums based on bebop theory.
When saxophonist and former Coltrane collaborator Archie Shepp was offered a job at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1969, he hoped to teach the music as he was playing it: in conversation with African diasporic culture, in collaboration with theater artists and dancers, in spaces designed around the ethics of the music itself.
“I quickly learned that that was not too feasible, and mine was a point of view that was not welcomed,” Shepp, 83, said in an interview. He proposed setting up a program in African American music within the music department, but was shut down; he landed in African American studies instead. “The idea of Black music input or some nonwhite element being integrated into the academic experience was immediately rejected,” he said.
Shepp was one of the various cutting-edge musicians who were invited to teach at the university level around this time, but never fully embraced by music departments. “They were not willing to tolerate an Archie Shepp or a Max Roach, a Sun Ra or a Cecil Taylor,” the historian Robin D.G. Kelley said in an interview. “They kicked them out and said, let’s open the doors to ‘professionals’” — primarily white instructors who weren’t top-tier public performers.
Combined with the resegregation of public education and the defunding of arts programs in many cities, the effects of academicization have been profound, and ironic. Jazz got a crucial nudge into the academy from Wynton Marsalis and his fellow young neo-traditionalists, who were guarding against what they saw as the corruptions of fusion and free jazz. But even the music made by the ace students in academic programs nowadays rarely upholds the qualities Marsalis meant to protect: the swing rhythm at the music’s core; a clear commitment to the blues; focus on lyricism.
When esteemed drummer Billy Hart, now 79, took his first university teaching job in the 1990s, he got the sense that the academy was finally ready to hire real practitioners. “It became some kind of fad,” he said dryly in an interview. “They decided that the students would be better suited if they had somebody that had experience.”
Naledi Masilo, a jazz undergrad at the New England Conservatory and the president of its Black Student Union, said that with the events of this summer, she and other Black students felt called to speak up.
“Until the recent uprising and Black consciousness on all of these school campuses, there weren’t many conversations had on campus on a deep level about what role Blackness plays in this music,” Masilo said. “It was especially shocking to me in this jazz program, where there’s only three Black students and three Black faculty. There was a disconnect — how are you teaching this music without giving any real influence to the people and the culture?”
The students made three immediate demands, calling for action within the month. A group of NEC alumni followed with a forceful letter of its own, co-signing the students’ ultimatums and adding more — including that the jazz department be renamed the department of Black American music.
Jason Moran, a MacArthur-winning pianist and multidisciplinary artist, is a professor at NEC, where he advises the Black Student Union. He tells his students to bear in mind that they should always be in tension with the institutions they seek to change. “An underground movement has to be underground,” he said in an interview.
In his own classroom, he rejects the notion of having a written curriculum. “What I talk about in my classes between my students and I, the kinds of conversations we have to break down about repertoire — who wrote what and why — is not on a syllabus,” he said. “You would never detect it if you searched it, because I don’t teach that way.”
Some schools are starting to approach the integration of humanities, history and artistic instruction that Shepp and others had in mind 50 years ago. One is Harvard University’s Creative Practice and Critical Inquiry doctoral program, recently founded by pianist Vijay Iyer and driven by a mostly female faculty from a variety of global traditions. Another is the Berklee Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice, founded by drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, who conceived of the program with activists including Angela Davis.
Mitchell, the Chicago-based flutist, took over the jazz studies program at the University of Pittsburgh last year, stepping in after the death of its prior director, Geri Allen. Founded by saxophonist Nathan Davis in 1970 as a concession to Black student activists, Pitt’s jazz program was attractive to Mitchell because of its focus on scholarship and musicology, as well as learning the notes.
Upon arriving, she proposed that the jazz program partner with the school’s Center for African American Poetry to open a small venue in the community engagement center that Pitt was building in a historically Black neighborhood. The administration immediately said yes.
“This will be place for local musicians to perform, for students to connect with local musicians,” Mitchell said.
“The music is about community,” she added. “So if a student graduates and doesn’t have any connection to community, that’s a real rip-off for that student in terms of what they’re supposed to be gaining. And it’s also a rip-off for the future of the music.”

When COVID-19 started spreading across the globe in late winter and some nations began sealing their borders, American artist Kehinde Wiley was abroad and quickly had to decide where he wanted to ride out the coming viral storm.
He chose Dakar, Senegal, site of his spacious, magnificently windswept Black Rock studio complex on the sea. For the past year, the West African studio has been home to a revolving cast of painters, photographers, authors and others who were selected in Wiley’s first round of his residency program, designed to offer artists the time and space to pursue their craft.
Watching from across the Atlantic as America roils, deaths from the coronavirus mount, protests swell over police killings and Confederate statues fall has “felt like a bit of a freak show,” Wiley said.
The 43-year-old artist, whose father is Nigerian and mother is African American, is best known for his portrait of President Barack Obama. His timely “Rumors of War” statue of a Black man with ponytailed dreadlocks, hoodie and ripped jeans on the back of a horse — in the style of monuments to Confederate war generals — graced Times Square last year before being moved to its permanent home in Richmond, Virginia.
The pandemic reshaped plans for Wiley and for some of the artists at his residency. His exhibition of residents’ work set for display at an old airplane hangar at Dakar’s 2020 Biennale had to be scrapped when the festival was canceled. The originally planned six-week residency of one artist at Black Rock, Nigerian writer Kelechi Njoku, has turned into a nearly seven-month stint after Nigeria sealed its borders and Njoku couldn’t return home.
For the past few weeks, he and Wiley have been the only inhabitants, besides staff members, in the spacious complex as the other artists returned to their home countries.
“Being with him has definitely taught me how he thinks and how he approaches his art and how to have a business sense to play the long game,” Njoku said. “It’s like being with an older brother.”
Wiley has embraced the experience as a residency of his own, taking an extended pause from his other work across the globe to focus on his painting in his studio, situated along a coastline of jagged volcanic rocks.
While there’s no end in sight to Njoku’s residency, Black Rock is already taking applications until Aug. 31 for its new season. To encourage applications from more African artists, Wiley has publicized the residency in not just English, but also French, the colonial language spoken in some West African countries, as well as Wolof, the language most widely spoken in Senegal.
In a phone conversation, he addressed watching America at this time of uncertainty from afar. These are edited excerpts from the interview.
Q: How did you end up staying in Dakar?
A: This was not planned at all. I was in Norway doing some work there and then had to quickly make a decision on where to be. This was around the time New York was really starting to take some heavy hits. I just decided to hang out in Dakar. It was a great opportunity for me to spend time here in a way that is uninterrupted time. This was really impossible to find — these long stretches of time in Senegal. They had repatriation flights, and I had the opportunity to leave before things were a little too far advanced to do so. It was a choice to stay; a very decided moment.
Q: What have you gained from it?
A: I got to spend time with the art residents. It was an opportunity to really spend quality time with them with studio visits and critiquing each other’s work. They each come with their own kind of energy so it’s never quite the same program. They stay between one to three months, and so the roster of personalities is constantly shifting. You never get a sense of one Black Rock.
Q: What does this moment in America mean to you, in particular with the protests following George Floyd’s death ?
A: It’s a wake-up call to the white population in America. It’s what so many Black Americans have known and been trying to communicate for centuries. It comes as no shock or surprise to us that Black bodies are under assault on a daily basis. What comes as a shock is that so few have listened. By virtue of technology we’re able to have visualized in real time the destruction of Black bodies in public spaces. It’s loud and it’s in your face and it’s undeniable. America at large has had this ability to justify these killings. Now people are wondering whether this will actually bring change. We’ll see. I’m not impressed yet. I’m seeing a lot of self-aggrandizing and self-congratulations on the part of our white allies. I want to see that translate into change with prison reform and education reform, and not this abstract thing.
Q: How do you respond to people who say your “Rumors of War” piece seems prescient in light of the movement to tear down Confederate monuments?
A: Everyone says, “You really had your finger on the pulse with that idea.” We are expected to subsume this constant narrative of monuments — terrifying monuments — that are an insult to people of good will, and the fact I wanted to engage that conversation seems rather obvious to me. The timing of it and the way things all came together with the calls for removal of monuments — that is something special.
Q: Does the sculpture take on new meaning now?
A: Art has always been about taking up space. That’s one reason equestrian sculpture has been a thing — it’s about dominance. We as a society stand behind the glorification of this human being on a pedestal for any number of reasons. That we now are allowed that volume of space, that massive amount of space to be allocated to a Black person in a hoodie might seem trivial. But this is a revolutionary act of embracing a Black presence in the public square — and it’s actually quite shocking that these moments are still revolutionary in the 21st century. “Rumors of War” is such a simple act, yet that stands in sharp relief to the fact that we don’t often value Black people with our actions and our monuments. It’s the proper time now to create a type of public moment that can point to a terrible past, but also perhaps provide a path forward in terms of representation.
Q: What should commemorating this moment look like?
A: Instead of having one monument that goes up on the spot where Confederate statues were, we should have artists of all styles come in for a period of time where their work is on the pedestal. Then it comes down and other voices go up there. I like that idea of the pedestal itself as the frame. It’s our way of creating a stage, and whomever we decide to shine the spotlight on in that moment is incredibly important. That’s where we as a society are announcing what we believe in. It’s incredibly moral.
Q: What should we do with all the Confederate statues that came down?
A: We need a hall of horrors. You don’t have to melt it all down but create a space where we see our terrible past. It’s less about should it be in existence but should it be deified. Take it off the stage and put it back where it belongs.
Q: Your portrait of former President Obama is hanging in the National Gallery. How would you paint Trump if you had to do his portrait ?
A: (Laughter.) Yeah, that’s just never going to happen. Just the idea causes a physical reaction in me. You definitely weirded me out with that question. Oooh, I wonder who is going to be stuck with that job. That’s going to be an interesting moment.

A Black man died of suffocation in Rochester, New York, after police officers who were taking him into custody put a hood over his head and then pressed his face into the pavement for two minutes, according to video and records released by his family and local activists Wednesday.
The man, Daniel Prude, 41, died March 30, seven days after his encounter with the police, after being removed from life support, his family said.
His death occurred two months before the killing in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis set off protests across the United States. But it attracted widespread attention only Wednesday when his family held a news conference to highlight disturbing video footage of the encounter taken from body cameras that the police officers wore.
The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, and the Rochester police chief said they were investigating the death. The officers involved are still on the force.
Joe Prude, his brother, called 911 on March 23 after Daniel Prude, who was visiting from Chicago, ran out of his home in an erratic state. Prude had been taken to a hospital the previous day after he apparently began experiencing mental health problems, police reports show.
He was running through the street after leaving his brother’s home before Rochester police officers detained him. A truck driver also called 911 before officers arrived, according to internal police investigations of the case, to say that a man wearing no clothes was trying to break into a car and saying that he had the coronavirus.
The video, first reported by the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester, shows Prude, who has taken off his clothes, with his hands behind his back. He is standing on the pavement in handcuffs, shouting, before officers put a so-called spit hood on his head, apparently in an effort to prevent him from spitting on them. New York was in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic at the time.
After the hood is placed over Prude’s head, he becomes more agitated. At one point, he shouts, “Give me that gun. Give me that gun,” and three officers push him to the ground.
The video shows one officer placing both hands on Prude’s head and holding him against the pavement, while another places a knee on his back, even as the hood remains on his head.
One officer repeatedly tells Prude to “stop spitting” and to “calm down.”
After two minutes, Prude is no longer moving or speaking, and the same officer can be heard asking, “You good, man?”
The officer then notices that Prude had thrown up water onto the street.
A paramedic is called over, about five minutes after the officers placed the hood on Prude’s head, to perform CPR on him before he is put into an ambulance.
The Monroe County medical examiner ruled Prude’s death a homicide caused by “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint,” according to an autopsy report.
“Excited delirium” and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or the drug PCP, were contributing factors, the report said.
The body camera video was provided to Elliot Dolby-Shields, a lawyer for Prude’s family, on Aug. 20 through an open records request, and then released to the public Wednesday after he and relatives reviewed the footage.
At the news conference Wednesday, activists and members of Prude’s family said the officers involved should be fired and charged with homicide, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. Joe Prude called the death a “coldblooded murder.”
“How many more brothers got to die for society to understand that this needs to stop,” Joe Prude said.
What happened to Prude was not an isolated episode, added Ashley Gantt, a local community organizer. “Daniel’s case is the epitome of what is wrong with this system,” Gantt said.
At a separate news conference, Rochester’s police chief, La’Ron D. Singletary, said he understood that people were angry about Prude’s death and frustrated about the lack of action in the matter, as well as about the delay in releasing the video.
“I know that there is a rhetoric that is out there that this is a cover-up,” Singletary said. “This is not a cover-up.”
Later Wednesday, more than 100 protesters gathered for hours in downtown Rochester outside a police station and marched to the street where Prude had been detained. The demonstration grew tense at times. Police officers, some of whom wore masks with Thin Blue Line flags, shot what appeared to be tear gas or pepper spray at protesters as they stood in a line across from them.
James said in a statement that a unit in her office dedicated to investigating deaths in which the police are involved had already opened an inquiry.
“The death of Daniel Prude was a tragedy,” James said, adding that “as with every investigation, we will follow the facts of this case and ensure a complete and thorough examination of all relevant parties.”
In an interview late Wednesday, Dolby-Shields called the case a “huge misuse of force,” and questioned why officers took “such a long time” to call for CPR.
He also disagreed with the decision not to suspend the officers involved.
“How do you watch the video and say what they did is OK?” Dolby-Shields said. “How do you watch it and say, ‘You guys can still go out on the street and make arrests?’”
Rochester’s mayor, Lovely Warren, speaking at the same news conference as the police chief, said she was “very disturbed” by what the video showed.
“This is not something that’s in our wheelhouse, in our control at this moment in time,” Warren said, an apparent reference to the attorney general’s inquiry. “And had it been, for me this would be something that we would’ve talked about months ago.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said late Wednesday that he had not yet seen the video, but had been briefed on it.
“The way it was described is very disturbing,” said the governor, who asked James to investigate the death, via an executive order, in July.
Cuomo said he did not want to comment on the status of James’ investigation, but “people should know that it is under investigation and has been for months.”
Law enforcement officers typically use so-called spit hoods to protect against blood-borne pathogens when a detainee is biting or spitting.
But incidents in recent years have raised concerns about the safety of the hoods. They were involved in several of the 70 deaths in law enforcement custody over the past decade where, The New York Times found, the people who died did so after saying, “I can’t breathe.”
The use of spit hoods has been cited in several lawsuits. One involved a 56-year-old inmate at a county jail in Michigan who died several days after sustaining a “severe anoxic brain injury” in a violent altercation during which officers put a spit hood over his head, according to a lawsuit cited by The Guardian.
A Tennessee county agreed to pay a $150,000 settlement in a case several years ago that involved a detainee who died after officers used a spit hood on him, The Tennessean reported.
And in 2013, a 41-year-old man died in the custody of the Milwaukee County sheriff’s office; he had complained he could not breathe after officers put a spit mask over his entire head, The Journal Sentinel reported.
In response, the newspaper reported, an officer replied: “You’re talking, you’re breathing.”

President Donald Trump has directed federal officials to find ways to cut funding to a string of cities controlled by Democrats, citing violence amid protests against systemic racism in policing, a move that threatens billions of dollars for many of the country’s largest urban hubs as the president makes the unrest a centerpiece of his reelection campaign.
Trump laid out the directive in a memo, released Wednesday, to Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Attorney General William Barr. It accuses state and local officials of abdicating their duties.
“Anarchy has recently beset some of our states and cities,” Trump wrote in the memo, mentioning a few cities specifically: Portland, Oregon; Washington; Seattle; and the president’s birth city, New York. “My administration will not allow federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones.”
With polls showing him trailing his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump has tried to shift the public’s attention away from his administration’s failed response to the coronavirus pandemic and to what he depicts as out-of-control crime in New York and other cities. He has seized on an uptick in crime and has tried to blame it on local Democratic leaders.
The president has repeatedly sought to paint cities as hellscapes that only he can save, regardless of how limited the violent outbreaks have been during broader protests against acts of brutality by police officers against Black people.
The memo, titled, “Reviewing Funding to State and Local Government Recipients That Are Permitting Anarchy, Violence and Destruction in American Cities” and was first reported by The New York Post, ratchets up Trump’s argument. But the move is almost certain to face legal challenges, and Democrats and city officials reacted furiously. Officials in New York said they were reviewing their legal options.
Bill Neidhardt, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, said on Twitter: “As much as Donald Trump wants New York City to drop dead, we will never let this stand. This has nothing to do with ‘law and order’. This is a racist campaign stunt out of the Oval Office to attack millions of people of color.”
An effort by Trump to curtail funding to so-called sanctuary cities was challenged in court, but a federal appeals court ruled this year that the administration was within its rights to withhold the money.
The memo appeared to be a dagger aimed squarely at New York, where de Blasio and the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats, have been critical of the federal response to the coronavirus. The memo went on at length about the recent rise in crime in New York City, and de Blasio’s recent agreement to cut $1 billion in funding to the New York Police Department.
“To ensure that federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our government’s promise to protect life, liberty and property, it is imperative that the federal government review the use of federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America’s cities,” the memo said.
It gives Barr 14 days to identify “anarchist jurisdictions” where officials have “permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures,” although it does not specify particular cities.
Vought has 30 days to direct “heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of federal grants,” according to the memo.
Among the factors that Barr is to consider in determining such jurisdictions are “whether a jurisdiction forbids the police force from intervening to restore order amid widespread or sustained violence or destruction,” whether a jurisdiction has pulled back law enforcement after being prevented access to a certain area and “whether a jurisdiction disempowers or defunds police departments.”
The revelation that Trump was considering such a move came hours after the New York Police Department released data showing that the surge in gun violence that has rattled the city this summer and intensified the debate over policing had continued at an alarming rate in August. Shootings more than doubled last month compared with August 2019, and murders rose nearly 50%, the police said.
The August numbers reflected a trend that many U.S. cities are contending with in a year that is already defined by a pandemic and civil unrest: a sharp rise in gun violence, murders and other crimes that has public officials grasping for explanations and scrambling to respond.
Still, Democrats said Trump’s move was not a solution but a political ploy.
Evan Hollander, a spokesman for the Democratic majority of the House Appropriations Committee, said Trump’s directive “intrudes on Congress’ power of the purse, would never stand up in court and is nothing more than a distraction from the fact that Americans are less safe under the Trump administration.”
A furious Cuomo, in an evening conference call with reporters, said the president’s letter was “another attempt to kill New York City,” where the president was long a resident and developer before officially moving to Florida last year. “Everything that he could possibly do in his power to hurt New York City he has done,” Cuomo said, adding: “The best thing he did for New York City was leave. Good riddance. Let him go to Florida. Be careful not to get COVID.”
Cuomo derided the president as thinking he was “a king.”
“It’s cheap, it’s political, it’s gratuitous, and it’s illegal,” the governor said of the memo. Trump, he said, “better have an army if he thinks he’s going to walk down the street in New York.”
Violent crime always increases in the summer, but the rise has been extreme in New York this year. Since May, the city has recorded 791 shootings, an increase of more than 140 compared with the same period last year. The 180 murders recorded from May to August is more than 50% above the same period in 2019.
In August alone, there were 242 shootings New York, compared with 91 the same month last year, and the number of murders rose to 53 from 36. As a result, the city surpassed 1,000 shootings before Labor Day, making it the worst year for gun violence since 2015, with four months left to go.
Still, this year’s numbers are well below where crime peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, and the recent rise in shootings and murders follows years during which the city saw violent crime drop to levels not seen since the 1950s.
The toll taken by the shootings has nonetheless been heavy. In August, the people who died from gun violence included the caretaker of a church in Brooklyn, who was shot inside the church; a mother shot in the back of the head in front of a school in the Bronx; and a man struck by a stray bullet in Brooklyn while he was playing handball.
Asked Wednesday about the rise in shootings, de Blasio said the city was dealing with a “perfect storm” and suggested that the pandemic was partly to blame.
“We know that with the entire society on hold for months, all sorts of things got set in motion that were truly unusual,” he said.
Despite the surge in gun violence, police data shows that arrest numbers have declined significantly over the summer while response times to 911 calls have risen sharply.
That has prompted some elected officials to call for an investigation into whether rank-and-file police officers are staging a work slowdown in response to the protests over police brutality and criminal justice reforms passed after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Police officials have challenged that idea, asserting instead that their resources were stretched thin as they have struggled to address other demands, including policing the protests.
The department’s ranks have also been thinned by the recent budget cuts cited by Trump and by a wave of retirements, leaving commanders scrambling to cover neighborhoods where violence is on the rise, officials said.

Planeload of ‘Thugs’? Barr Skirts Trump’s Claim but Suggests Rioters Targeted D.C.

WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr sidestepped questions on Wednesday about President Donald Trump’s incendiary conspiracy theory about a plane “loaded with thugs” headed to Washington over the weekend, saying that he did not know “what the president was specifically referring to,” but that the FBI was investigating myriad reports that outsiders had traveled to the city to cause trouble.
Barr said the Justice Department had received reports that people from the West Coast and other parts of the country had flown to Washington to exploit protests for racial justice as opportunities to attack law enforcement and damage property.
“We received numerous reports of individuals coming from Portland, Washington — Seattle — and several other cities to come into Washington for the specific purpose of causing a riot,” Barr said in an interview with CNN. “I think there were many on planes.”
His comments echoed remarks made by Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, who said in a recent news conference that violent clashes had occurred over the weekend between the police and protesters, and that outsiders who had come to Washington to fight with law enforcement were largely to blame.
“What we saw were agitators who descended on the city,” Bowser said. “It sounds like many of them came on Wednesday and Thursday armed for battle with fireworks, baseball bats, laser pointers, and they were looking for the police to confront. They set fire to local newspaper boxes, accomplishing absolutely nothing.”
Barr’s response distanced himself from the specific claim made by Trump — one that is similar to an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that has spread on Facebook and that senior administration officials say caught the White House off guard and forced aides to seek evidence that such a plane existed. But it also reinforced the president’s comments about agitators, primarily on the political left, working to turn Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and other cities into dangerous battlefields between anti-government extremists and law enforcement.
“I’ve talked to every police chief in every city where there’s been major violence, and they all have identified antifa as the ramrod for the violence,” Barr said. Antifa is a loose movement that purports to be against fascism, and whose members have been blamed by federal law enforcement officials for much of the violent behavior that has accompanied protests against systemic racism.
Barr said the Justice Department was investigating people who could be part of the antifa movement. Pressed to back up the claims about antifa — the Justice Department has instead identified members of “boogaloo,” a far-right group that believes a race war is coming, in criminal charging documents this summer related to violence at protests — he noted that some do not identify themselves as antifa members when they are arrested.
While Barr skirted Trump’s claim about a planeload of rioters, made during a Fox News interview on Monday night, White House aides have scrambled to reverse engineer what he must have meant, senior administration officials said. Officials pointed to briefings the president has received about agitators who traveled to different cities to take advantage of protests to create unrest, but no one could identify what airplane episode Trump was talking about.
In his interview with CNN, Barr also lent credence to Trump’s unsupported claims that voting by mail would lead to widespread fraud and cast doubt on the results of November’s elections. Voter fraud is rare, though slightly more common among mail-in votes, but any efforts large enough to swing an election outcome would most likely be detected, experts say.
Democrats fear that Trump has attacked voting by mail as a way to depress turnout in the presidential election.
Barr told CNN that voting by mail was “playing with fire.” He said foreign nations intended to manipulate the election by sending fake ballots to voters, but offered no evidence to support his claim. He called his assertion “a matter of logic.”
Intelligence and election security officials have undercut those claims, finding no intelligence that any foreign adversary is making a coordinated attempt to undermine absentee voting or create fake mail-in ballots.
Barr said that polling places should take precautions against the spread of the coronavirus and called for people who are particularly vulnerable to the virus to get an absentee ballot and cast it using guidelines and processes that existed before the pandemic.
He also declined to say that Russia was again working to interfere in the election, as intelligence officials have concluded, saying that he had only seen preliminary activity that suggested that the Kremlin “might try again.” The intelligence community said last month that Russia was already trying to interfere in the election to help the president but that China preferred he be defeated.
Barr said he believed China was far more of a threat than Russia or Iran in trying to influence the United States. The intelligence assessment last month concluded that while China sought to influence American politics, it had not yet decided to wade directly into the presidential race.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden, moving to refocus the campaign on the coronavirus pandemic after days of national attention on law enforcement issues, argued on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was hurting the nation’s parents and schoolchildren because of his mismanagement of the crisis.
“If President Trump and his administration had done their jobs early on with this crisis, America’s schools would be open, and they’d be open safely,” Biden said in a short speech after receiving a briefing from a group of experts. “Instead, American families all across this country are paying the price for his failures and his administration’s failures.”
Biden added that Trump “still doesn’t have any real plan for how to open our schools safely.” Declaring the matter of safely reopening schools a “national emergency,” he appealed directly to the president, making a direct-to-camera pitch before a quiet room of socially-distanced reporters at a theater in Wilmington.
“Mr. President, where are you?” Biden asked. “Where are you? Why aren’t you working on this? We need emergency support funding for our schools, and we need it now. Mr. President, that’s your job.”
“Get off Twitter,” he added.
As president, Biden said, he would direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure that K-12 schools had “full access” to federal aid.
Trump has demanded that schools reopen this fall and threatened to cut federal funding for school districts that defy his wishes. But many districts decided instead to begin the school year with remote instruction.
The lone exception among the country’s largest school districts is New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio reached a deal with unions on Tuesday to begin remote and in-person classes on Sept. 21 — 10 days later than originally planned.
Before Biden’s speech, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, emphasized to reporters the importance of reopening schools for in-person learning, both for the sake of children’s educations and for parents to go back to work. Biden “always casts things as an either-or situation: either we can open up or we can be safe,” Murtaugh said.
“The president disagrees with that,” the spokesman said. “It can be both. For the economy and schools, we can both be open and be safe.”
Biden’s remarks came as the presidential race has been dominated in recent days by debates over racial injustice and protests. In a strongly worded speech Monday, Biden sought to repudiate Republican efforts to paint him as radically anti-law enforcement, condemning violence and seeking to blame Trump for chaos on his watch.
On Tuesday, Trump visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, where a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by a white police officer on Aug. 23, setting off protests that at times turned destructive. And on Wednesday, the Trump campaign held a conference call for reporters on the subject of “left-wing mob violence.”
Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, will travel to Kenosha on Thursday, where they will meet with Blake’s father and other family members, according to a campaign official.
“We’ve got to heal,” Biden said after his speech when taking questions from reporters. “We’ve got to put things together, bring people together. And so, my purpose in going will be to do just that — to be a positive influence on what’s going on.”
Asked whether the officers involved in the police shootings of Blake in Kenosha and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, should be charged, Biden replied: “I think we should let the judicial system work its way. I do think there’s a minimum need to be charged.” (Biden’s campaign said later that based on his knowledge of the situation, charges involving the officers looked to be warranted, but a full investigation was necessary first.)
The Biden campaign has long sought to make the race a referendum on Trump’s character and leadership, focusing in particular on his stewardship of the pandemic and its economic fallout, and the speech on Wednesday represented an opportunity to put a spotlight on how Trump’s handling of the crisis was affecting the nation’s schools.
“This administration seems to think it’s all of a sudden going to go away, like angel dust is going to be sprayed around,” Biden said of the health crisis and its economic reverberations. “Everything’s going to be OK. I just don’t get it. They have to know better.”
In July, Biden released his own plan for safely reopening schools, which emphasized deference to local decision-making on whether and how schools could hold in-person classes in a safe manner.
The Biden campaign is also deploying Jill Biden, a community college professor, to help draw attention to the issue. On Tuesday, she visited a school in Wilmington to kick off a multiweek back-to-school tour that the campaign said would include in-person or virtual appearances in eight battleground states.
In recent days, a number of Democrats have said publicly and privately that they would like to see Biden campaign more aggressively in person. He has rarely left Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania since the coronavirus hit the United States.
Biden said that in consultation with medical experts, “we’ve worked out a protocol where, how I get on the plane, what kind of plane I get on, how it’s sanitized, where, how I engage people.”
“I would like to get out more,” he acknowledged at another point. “But I think a president has a responsibility to set examples, set the right example for how to get out.”
In response to a question, Biden also offered more details about how a mask mandate, something he has previously advocated, would work in practice — and what the limitations might be.
“I’m a constitutionalist,” Biden said. “You can’t do things the Constitution doesn’t allow you the power to do.”
But he would apply “as much pressure as I could” on local and state leaders to urge people to wear masks and follow social-distancing rules.
“The vast majority of the American people,” he said, “accept that notion.”

WASHINGTON — As crowds swelled against the backdrop of the Lincoln Memorial on Friday, activists spoke of a generational moment.
The Commitment March, held in support of racial justice amid nationwide protests against police brutality, was itself an echo of an earlier generation’s struggle for equality.
Fifty-seven years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. told an audience of more than 200,000 in the same space that America’s promise of equal rights under the law rang hollow for Black Americans, thousands of people rallied to protest continuing shortfalls of justice in the United States.
“When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir,” King said in 1963. “It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.”
To many who assembled in Washington on Friday, little had changed. But given the urgency of the moment, many attendees, some of whom had traveled from far-flung corners of the country, said their presence was aimed not only at expressing their own support for change but also at inspiring another generation: their children.
“They keep telling me about how it’s a shame that Black parents have to have ‘the conversation’ with our children, how we have to explain if a cop stops you, don’t reach for the glove compartment, don’t talk back, the conversation,” the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a speech at the event Friday. “Well, we’ve had the conversation for decades.
“It’s time we have a conversation with America,” he said.
Though the march was partly dedicated to George Floyd, who was 46 when he was killed by police in Minneapolis in May, many attendees also spoke of younger victims of recent violence, such as Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, who were in their 20s when they were killed this year. Some said they feared for their children’s future.

‘Nobody Likes Snitching’: How Rules Against Parties Are Dividing Campuses

It looked to be a typical college party: a small group of students crammed in a kitchenette, cheering on as a shirtless guy arm-wrestled a laughing young woman. No one wore masks.
The scene was posted on Snapchat by one of the partygoers, a first-year student at Cornell University, along with a selfie with a mocking caption: “The people who slide up saying ‘you’re not social distancing’ are the ones that wouldn’t have been invited anyway.”
The response was swift and severe. Within days, an online petition was created demanding that the student’s admission to Cornell be revoked, and in the week since, the petition has collected more than 3,500 signatures.
“Cornell University is attempting to take the biggest feat of allowing all students back on campus. This cannot be done without immense safety precautions taken and the compliance of every student,” a group calling itself the Concerned Student Coalition wrote in the petition. “We need to hold these students accountable for their actions.”
The situation at Cornell underscores a deeper tension on campuses all over the country as about 1,100 colleges embark on the huge experiment of reopening in a pandemic. Students, returning to school after months of isolation, are not only being asked to fully reimagine what their college social lives look like, but also to assume active roles as the front line against an outbreak at their schools by policing campus safety.
“Nobody likes snitching — it’s not comfortable,” said Melissa Montejo, a sophomore at Cornell who signed the petition. “I really am not one to go around and tell people what to do, but for me, this was troubling. Three months of being careful and not engaging in problematic behavior is worth saving a life.”
Jessica Zhang, the student who posted the party scene to Snapchat, said she had apologized and met with Cornell officials. Neither Zhang or Cornell would say whether she was disciplined.
In recent weeks, the coronavirus outbreak has spread swiftly on college campuses. The New York Times has tracked thousands of cases that were linked to returning students. Several schools, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Notre Dame and the State University of New York College at Oneonta, suspended in-person classes after more than 100 students at each campus tested positive, often after large parties.
As a result, growing numbers of college officials are realizing that there are limits to what they can monitor on their own — and are calling on students to help.
Colgate University sent students a memo encouraging them to report classmates who violate social-distancing guidelines and to include names so action could be taken. Similar instructions were sent out at schools across the country from the University of Colorado Boulder to the University of Pennsylvania. Yale University and some other colleges have hotlines in place for reports of risky activity.
It’s an extraordinary situation, and students face a quandary: Report parties to campus officials? Or keep quiet and hope for the best? As one freshman said at Hunter College, which has a dorm open even though classes are remote this semester: “I don’t know if I’d want to narc on people I’m trying to become friends with.”
For those in the middle of it, the choice is not as simple as they might have expected.
“Before coming here, I remember thinking ‘Yeah, I’ll definitely report people if they’re going to parties,’” said Kyle Duran, a freshman at Binghamton University in upstate New York. But after spending just a few days on campus, Duran had second thoughts. “It’s a lot harder to want to when you’re living and going to class with everyone.”
Some faculty members at schools have warned against asking students to police their peers. They have said doing so could disrupt student life when classmates are pitted against one other, particularly when the consequences for breaking the rules can be harsh.
SUNY Plattsburgh, for example, placed 43 students on interim suspension last week after a large outdoor gathering. Fifteen others at Marist College, a small liberal arts school in Poughkeepsie, New York, were recently sent home for not following rules at an off-campus party, while at Ohio State University, more than 200 have been suspended for similar reasons.
Ariana Rebello, a freshman at Hofstra University on Long Island, said hearing about those punishments at other schools has dissuaded her from attending parties, but also from reporting her classmates. “I don’t think I could bring myself to snitch. I just wouldn’t associate with them,” she said.
In states with high virus counts, many administrators said they worried that college parties could accelerate an all-but-inevitable rise of clusters on their campuses. But in the New York metropolitan area, which has largely continued to stem its own outbreak, the concerns carry a different weight.
Some epidemiologists said they feared that college parties and large social gatherings could lead to a resurgence of the virus in places like the New York region that have kept case counts low.
“The biggest concern is that you are going to have newly infected people leave these parties and disperse back into their communities,” said Dr. Stephen Thomas, an infectious disease specialist at SUNY Upstate Medical University. “It’s that they’re going to be sources for continuing to spread the virus and it’s going to reverse the work that has already been done.”
Many students say they have more self-interested reasons to report their peers. On TikTok and other social media platforms, videos have gone viral in which students say “snitching” on their classmates would be an easy choice because of how much it costs to attend their colleges.
But for others like Cambria Kelley, a first-year graduate student at New York University, the issue is more personal. Kelley, who is from California, said several members of her family contracted the illness over the last few months, including her grandmother who died in July.
NYU has asked students to “politely urge” their classmates to wear masks and socially distance and to report those who violate that advice to school officials. And despite the friendships she may form with her classmates, Kelley said she will still feel an obligation to do so, keeping her family in mind.
“If it was bad enough, I wouldn’t hesitate to report them,” Kelley said. “I’m not going to be having my life put at risk because people decided to be selfish. These rules are for the good of everyone here.”
Some students, however, said deciding whether to report classmates involves a different calculation.
As a national conversation erupted on the role of police in cities following the killing of George Floyd, groups at schools including Vassar College, Stony Brook University and Columbia University called on their institutions to rethink their relationships with campus and local police.
Now they are wrestling with the prospect of relying on those departments to disperse and crack down on large gatherings.
Maggie Peng, a senior at Syracuse University, said she plans to approach friends one-on-one to have conversations about the risks of partying. She even wrote a lengthy message in a Facebook group for first-year students urging them to take social distancing more seriously after a large outdoor gathering that drew hundreds.
But Peng said shifting the responsibility for keeping one another safe from individual students to campus police was troubling. She and other students at the school said that since large social events occurred two weeks ago, they have noticed more officers than usual monitoring residential spaces and common areas.
Peng said the role of campus security in enforcing rules would dissuade her from reporting her classmates.
“It just doesn’t make sense to rely on campus police for enforcing these rules,” Peng said. “Especially when there has been so much tension, it’s hard to want them involved. Anything bad that happens will usually involve students of color.”
As the first weeks back on campuses shift into the more regular pace of the fall, the question remains: Just how long will students, many of whom arrived in New York state to a mandatory two-week quarantine, continue to follow their schools’ physical-distancing guidelines?
Some officials at large universities in particular worry parties, especially those off campus, could slip by undetected.
For now, the students who are caught attending them face harsh punishments as a warning to others.
Zhang, the first-year student at Cornell who posted videos of a party to Snapchat, said in a recent interview that she deeply regrets both the “lapse in judgment” she made by attending the gathering and her “insensitive comments” afterward.
“Incoming freshmen come in with heavy expectations, we all want to find our people,” Zhang said. “I’m not proud of those posts, they show me at my worst.”
Since her posts spread on social media, Zhang said she has received hundreds of threats, with much of the heaviest criticism coming from classmates.
As classes at Cornell begin this week, there may soon be an additional layer to complicated tensions students face when reporting one another: Zhang could end up sitting in the same row of her first college lectures as those who called for her expulsion.

Fueling Partisan Passions Through a Summer of Unrest: [National Desk]

Full text: President Trump has employed provocative and sometimes incendiary words and images to focus attention on demonstrations and away from the human and economic costs of the pandemic.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump has seized on the response in the streets to police brutality against Black men and women to bolster his re-election campaign, employing provocative and sometimes incendiary language and images to incite his followers, demonize his opponents or both.
He has sought to conflate all protesters with the small minority of people who have looted stores, started fires and engaged in violence against police officers. He has blamed street unrest on Democratic mayors and governors and even former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his fall challenger.
He has also repeatedly threatened to deploy federal forces. And especially since a man affiliated with a right-wing group was shot and killed in Portland, Ore., on Saturday night, he has seemed to encourage freelance action by his own supporters who have showed up as well in places like Kenosha, Wis., eager to counter the protesters and sometimes engaging in violence themselves.
Mr. Trump's approach, intended to divert attention from the human and economic costs of the pandemic, is consistent with a career of combative politics that play to racial animosities, going back to his time in business.
Since becoming president, he has seemed to equate white supremacists marching to preserve a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 to the people who demonstrated against them. And in 2018, during the midterm congressional campaign, he repeatedly warned that caravans of would-be immigrants heading to the southern border posed a national threat, a topic he quickly dropped after the elections.
Here is a breakdown of how Mr. Trump has sought to fuel partisan passions to his benefit during the summer of unrest touched off by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other similar episodes that followed:
Defining Protesters
While aides maintain that Mr. Trump respects peaceful protesters, he regularly lumps them with those who have engaged in violence, calling them anarchists and thugs who hate America and likening the demonstrations to mob rule. "Protesters, your ass," he said at a rally in New Hampshire on Friday.
He has at times exaggerated the extent of the violence and falsely attributed it across the board to the Antifa anti-fascist movement, one of his favorite targets. Over the weekend, he even retweeted a message from the conservative One America News Network asserting that the protests were actually a well-organized effort to mount a coup against him.
While Mr. Trump condemned the killing of Mr. Floyd shortly after it happened and signed a largely symbolic executive order meant to encourage police training, the president has done little since then to address the concerns of many Americans horrified by that encounter and others. Instead, he has focused on defending the police, who he says have been unfairly smeared and should not have their funding cut. He has also pushed back against critics, calling Black Lives Matter "a symbol of hate." Some of the protesters, he has said, "don't even know who George Floyd is."
Partisan Attacks
Mr. Trump has repeatedly blamed "weak" governors and mayors for unrest in "Democrat-led cities." He has claimed that the turmoil represents what would happen in "Joe Biden's America" if he is elected, even though it is happening in Donald Trump's America.
"Without law enforcement, we wouldn't have a country," he said at a White House news conference on Monday. "If you give the radical left power, what you're seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country."
The president and his allies highlighted the issue as a signature theme of last week's Republican National Convention and have sought to put Mr. Biden and other Democrats on the defensive by accusing them of not condemning violence, although in fact they have.
Threats to Use Force
A running theme of Mr. Trump's statements and Twitter messages is his eagerness to send in federal agents or the National Guard even though governors and mayors have resisted it. The local police, he says about various cities, "aren't allowed to do their thing" but if troops were brought in, they could end the violence almost instantaneously. "We could fix Portland in, I would say, 45 minutes," he said the other day.
Mr. Trump has gone so far as to claim that he is "the only thing standing between the American dream and total anarchy, madness and chaos."
The National Guard in each state reports to the governor, not the president. Mr. Trump could use his power under the two-century-old Insurrection Act to federalize a state's guard units over the objections of a governor, but he has been reluctant to do so.
Encouraging Supporters to Act
Rather than call for calm, Mr. Trump has cheered on his own supporters to wade into the furor in the streets, setting up collisions that have led to even more violence. Kyle H. Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who attended a Trump rally, showed up at a demonstration in Kenosha wielding a military-style rifle and was later charged with homicide after two protesters were shot to death.
On Monday, the president cast Mr. Rittenhouse's alleged actions as self-defense. "He probably would have been killed," Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump reposted a tweet in support of Mr. Rittenhouse over the weekend that called him "a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump." The president also seemed to justify supporters who cruised through Portland firing paintballs and pepper spray at protesters (and at least one reporter), saying it "cannot be unexpected after 95 days of watching and incompetent Mayor admit that he has no idea what he is doing."

It was a disgrace. Protesters, you know what I say, "Protesters, your ass" -- I don't talk about my ass. They're not protesters. Those aren't -- those are anarchists, they're agitators, they're rioters, they're looters. They're not, you know, you say that and some of the people, not all of them, but some of the people back there -- "Oh, how dare you?" These are friendly protesters, right? Friendly protesters. [crowd jeering] They're just looking for trouble, has nothing to do with George Floyd, has nothing to do with anything. They don't even know who George Floyd is." (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES); AUG. 21: "Now Americans must rally to turn back the radical left socialists and Marxists right here at home. And you see that when you see these people rioting in Portland -- where you see the anger, the craziness, these people are crazy. They're crazy. And we won't let it go on much longer, by the way, because you know they're supposed to police their own kind. But we're not going to let it go on much longer. Because at some point, we have to say, "OK, you've had enough, time to police your town." And by the way, they have good police. They have good -- Portland has good police, but they're not, again, they're not allowed to do their job."; AUG. 7: "Have a situation where things are going on as they are today. We must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York and many others. Democrat-run." (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANNA MONEYMAKER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES); AUG. 29: Tweet from Mike Baker, a New York Times reporter: "Clashes. Trump people unload paintballs and pepper spray. They shot me too."

Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies fatally shot a Black man who they said had a handgun Monday afternoon after a stop turned into a violent altercation, authorities said.
The Los Angeles County deputies handcuffed the man, Dijon Kizzee, 29, after firing at him several times in Westmont, a South Los Angeles neighborhood. The aftermath of the shooting was recorded by bystanders, who protested authorities’ deadly use of force. As the day turned to evening, a crowd of protesters gathered at the site of the shooting.
Kizzee was identified early Tuesday by the Los Angeles County medical examiner-coroner.
According to the Sheriff’s Department, Kizzee had been riding a bicycle when deputies tried to stop him. The reason for the stop was a code violation related to bicycle riding, according to the department, which did not elaborate on the nature of the violation.
Kizzee fled, and deputies chased him, the department said. When they caught up with him near West 109th Place and Budlong Avenue around 3:30 p.m., a fight began.
At a news conference, Lt. Brandon Dean of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said Kizzee had “punched one of the officers in the face” and dropped some items he had been holding. “The deputies noticed that inside the clothing items that he dropped was a black semi-automatic handgun, at which time” a deputy opened fire, he said.
The Sheriff’s Department said the shooting was under investigation by multiple entities, including the district attorney’s office and the Internal Affairs Bureau, which is standard practice when a civilian is killed by an officer.
The shooting took place about 4 miles north of where Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies fatally shot an 18-year-old Latino man five times in the back in June in Gardena, use of force that the man’s family contends had been unjustified.
Hours after the shooting Monday, more than 100 people congregated at the scene. Protesters standing behind yellow tape held up raised fists and signs like “Black Lives Matter,” “Defund the Police” and “Resign All LASD.”
During chants by the demonstrators, sheriff’s deputies stared silently at the protesters while the lights of two police vehicles shined at the crowd.
One demonstrator, Taegen Meyer, said she had turned out to protest to “stand with community, stand with families and show our dedication to justice.” A group of people who had been protesting for three months coordinated on encrypted messaging app Signal, she said, declaring it an emergency action.
There was one arrest for unlawful assembly, Deputy Tracy Koerner, a spokesman for the department, said Tuesday morning.
The shooting comes as law enforcement officers across the nation are facing intense scrutiny over the use of force and biased policing after George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis. His death, which was captured on a bystander’s video, fueled nationwide protests against police and prompted some to call for departments to be defunded.
Last week, police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back while he was attempting to enter the driver’s side of an SUV during a dispute. Three of his children were in the back seat. Blake’s father told CNN on Monday that his son was paralyzed from the waist down.
The police shooting prompted unrest in several cities, and there were violent clashes in Kenosha and Portland, Oregon, between protesters and right-wing activists, leaving three people dead. President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to Kenosha on Tuesday, a visit that state and local officials discouraged. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has spoken with Blake’s father.
It was not immediately clear if the deputies involved in the shooting Monday were wearing body cameras. In contrast to the Los Angeles Police Department, which is a separate law enforcement agency, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has been slow to use body cameras, The Los Angeles Times reported in June.
The newspaper cited several reasons for the delay cost factors, including a lack of a consensus on who is able to get access to the camera footage and red tape. It also reported that it was not uncommon for sheriff’s deputies to wear their own body cameras.
The focus on body cameras followed two fatal shootings by sheriff’s deputies within 24 hours in June. In one case, Andres Guardado, 18, a Latino security guard, was killed by deputies in Gardena.
The Sheriff’s Department said that Guardado had been carrying a loaded firearm that had a “prohibited magazine” and that he had not been in uniform or recognized as a licensed security officer by the state. Guardado’s family has said that the killing was not justified.
