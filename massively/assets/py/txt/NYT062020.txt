It was evident in marquee congressional contests, in a county district attorney race and in numerous battles for state legislative seats: A political sea change has swept New York.
After the count of ballots cast in person last week, insurgent Democrats were poised to topple or succeed longtime incumbents. Many of the challengers are candidates of color; many of the incumbents are white.
Rep. Eliot L. Engel, a House veteran in his 32nd year who leads the Foreign Affairs Committee, appeared to be the biggest name likely to fall; he was badly trailing Jamaal Bowman, a Black middle school principal from Yonkers.
In the state Legislature, at least six incumbents, mostly male and white, were either trailing or in close races against insurgent candidates.
With nearly 2 million absentee ballots issued to voters statewide because of the coronavirus outbreak, very few races have been called; county elections officials will begin counting those ballots Wednesday.
But the machine ballot count made it clear that New York politics is in the midst of a generational political shift, one that has been precipitated not only by the progressive energy and shifting attitudes toward racial equity that have swept the nation, but by the diversity in race, sexuality and gender of the candidates that voters are catapulting to office.
The shift was magnified by the candidacies of two men, Mondaire Jones and Ritchie Torres, attempting to make historic runs for the House: If elected, they would become the first openly gay Black members of Congress.
In the South Bronx, Torres, who identifies as Afro-Latino, has twice as many votes as his closest competitor, Assemblyman Michael Blake, the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.
And in the race to replace Rep. Nita Lowey, who will be retiring after a 32-year career, Jones, 33, held a seemingly insurmountable lead in a suburban district that is 60% non-Hispanic white. His closest challenger, Adam Schleifer, a former federal prosecutor whose father is a wealthy pharmaceutical executive, had outspent him by a 4-to-1 margin.
Much of the leftward lurch is rooted in President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 and his reelection bid this year, and fueled by the inroads of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s two presidential candidacies, which thrust his democratic socialist ideology and calls for revolution into the political mainstream across the country.
But it was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning primary upset in 2018 against Joseph Crowley, one of the House’s highest-ranking members, which gave voters and progressive groups the confidence to take on entrenched incumbents, especially in New York.
A few months later, the members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of Democrat state senators who worked with Republicans, were vanquished in the state primary. And the following June, Tiffany Cabán’s performance in the primary race for Queens district attorney — nearly defeating the party-backed candidate, Melinda Katz — truly crystallized what was to come.
“This moment feels like continued momentum and progress,” Cabán, now a national political organizer for the Working Families Party, said in an interview. “You can call it progressive, you can call it liberal, or you can call it people who just want a foot off their neck.”
The political shift has also been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has magnified long-standing racial health disparities, and the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota.
Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, said that last Tuesday’s elections were a “referendum on Black lives” that signaled a political realignment was in progress.
“This was a ‘what side are you on’ moment,” he said.
The early results underscored a national trend in Democratic politics that seems to be playing out in New York, too: Candidates of color are assembling broad winning coalitions that bring together liberal white voters and voters of color. White majority districts can be led by people of color and Black candidates if the message is broad, progressive and inclusive, said Sochie Nnaemeka, head of the New York State Working Families Party.
“Voters are hungry for a different type of leadership,” she said.
Nowhere does that appear to be more true than in Jones’ race in the 17th Congressional District, which includes Rockland County and parts of Westchester County and is majority white and only 10% Black.
“My story is quintessentially the American dream, and people want to be inspired by their elected officials,” said Jones, who grew up poor in Rockland County and then went to Stanford University and to Harvard Law School. “When people bring their lived experience with them to policymaking, that process becomes more informed.”
Race and identity politics were not necessarily the only thing driving insurgent campaigns. Most candidates ran on unabashedly left-wing platforms, supporting Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. They hammered their opponents for being absent from their districts.
In Westchester County, a female federal prosecutor, Mimi Rocah, whose campaign was centered on a progressive “Right Side of Justice” agenda, was leading the incumbent district attorney, Anthony Scarpino.
Many challengers had deep ties to their communities: They were teachers, activists, tenant organizers. But race was certainly an underlying factor in many of the candidacies, and it was amplified by the recent civil unrest over police brutality.
During Bowman’s speech to supporters on the night of the primary, he talked about how Black men in America experience “death and homicide and suicide” at an early age. Poverty, he said, was “by design” and rooted in America’s racist history.
“Eliot Engel, and I’ll say his name once, used to say that he was a thorn in the side of Donald Trump,” Bowman said, referring to the incumbent he’s looking to unseat. “But you know what Donald Trump is afraid of more than anything else? A Black man with power.”
In an interview, Bowman, 44, said he spoke about his experience as a Black man in America, and how he worked to help underserved children and families in the Bronx in all parts of the district during the campaign.
“I don’t expect white allies to have the same consciousness of being Black in America as me when I first meet them,” Bowman said. “There is a learning process and a dialogue process that happens.”
The anti-establishment sentiment was also prominently in display in Queens, one of the most ethnically diverse parts of the country and the bedrock of Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign.
There, three candidates for state Assembly — Jessica González-Rojas, who is of Paraguayan and Puerto Rican descent; Jenifer Rajkumar, who is Indian American; and Zohran Mamdani, who is from Uganda and is of Indian descent — were all beating white incumbents as of Tuesday.
Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant, said young, energetic candidates of color were successfully fusing left-wing activism with the changing demographics of Queens.
“I’m not saying the political philosophy is unimportant, but the kindling for this fire is demographic,” Gyory said.
Matt Thomas, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, which backed Mamdani’s campaign, credited the group’s success to ideology, not demographics or race.
“People are starting to realize there is a whole different set of values and philosophy of progressivism,” he said. Still, none of the group’s five candidates this election cycle were white.
One of the group’s tactics was to engage minority communities that had long been marginalized. Mamdani’s campaign crafted mailers and policy proposals to target Astoria’s Muslim and South Asian communities.
The group’s organizing tactics have also been sharpened with each successive election season, and its fundraising has become more robust following its earlier successes.
The momentum of left-leaning minority candidates could spill over into New York City’s citywide 2021 election. Jumaane Williams, the public advocate, who is Black, is being urged by some to reconsider his pledge to not run for mayor next year.
Other mainstream Democrats such as Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the No. 5 Democrat in the House, may also face insurgent candidates of color.
In 2018, Cuomo easily turned back Cynthia Nixon’s Democratic primary challenge; Charlie King, a longtime Democratic operative and a former senior campaign adviser to Cuomo, said that the governor and Jeffries most likely had little to worry about.
“When predators are at the watering hole looking for wildebeest or elephants to eat they don’t go after the strong ones; Hakeem the elephant and Cuomo the elephant have tusks,” King said. “The Engel elephant — who was very powerful in his day — had three legs.”

WILMINGTON, Del. — Joe Biden leveled a broad attack against President Donald Trump on Tuesday over his response to the coronavirus, his refusal to wear a mask, his handling of intelligence on Russia targeting U.S. troops and even his “cognitive capability” during a rare news conference in which Biden repeatedly drew distinctions with his November opponent.
Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, laid out an updated plan to address the pandemic as cases rise in many states. He accused Trump of having “surrendered” to the virus. And he underscored the importance of wearing a mask in public, something the president has refused to do, saying, “You have a moral obligation.”
From a lectern in a high school gym in Wilmington, flanked by two teleprompters and in front of an American flag, Biden denounced Trump in a 20-minute speech that focused on the coronavirus. Then he took questions from reporters for about half an hour. The blistering critique he made of Trump spanned the breadth of the presidency, touching on matters foreign and domestic, as well as the example and the tone Trump had set.
“The president talks about, you know, manhood and, you know, and being strong, and you don’t need the mask,” he said. “I think we have to start appealing to the better side of human nature by pointing out that that mask is not so much to protect me.”
“It’s to protect other people,” he added. “And it’s called patriotism. It’s called responsibility.” The president, Biden said, “puts everything in terms of him.”
Before the speech, the Biden campaign released an updated plan for fighting the coronavirus, given “the current circumstances we face as a result of President Trump’s persistent failures.”
The plan said that “minutes after he is declared the winner of the election,” Biden would call Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and ask him to work for Biden just as he has worked for past presidents.
“Dr. Fauci will have full access to the Oval Office and an uncensored platform to speak directly to the American people — whether delivering good news or bad,” the plan said.
The plan addresses issues like improving testing and tracing, supplying personal protective equipment, developing a vaccine and reopening the economy. In his speech, Biden encouraged the president “to adopt this plan in its entirety.”
Biden, the former vice president, has made only sporadic in-person appearances since the pandemic upended Americans’ daily routines, and his campaign is refraining from holding rallies with large crowds that are typically a staple of the campaign trail.
On Tuesday, Biden described the current situation as “the most unusual campaign, I think, in modern history.” He said that he would not hold rallies as the pandemic raged — a contrast with Trump.
“I’m going to follow the docs’ orders, not just for me, but for the country,” Biden said.
“The irony is I think we’re probably communicating directly in detail with more people than we would have otherwise,” he added, describing his many virtual appearances and citing his strong poll numbers. “But I’d much rather be doing it in person.”
Over the past few months, Biden has repeatedly criticized Trump over his response to the coronavirus, and this month, he laid out an eight-part plan for reopening the economy.
As of Tuesday, more than 126,000 people had died of the virus in the United States alone and more than 2.6 million people nationwide had been infected.
Trump has staunchly defended his handling of the pandemic and has, at various times, claimed that the virus will fade away and that the spike in cases was a result of increased testing. He and his administration have insisted on reopening the economy rapidly, even as concerns about viral spread have persisted.
And the surge in cases in recent weeks in states like Florida, Texas and California has forced the political leaders of those states to pause their reopenings and close down businesses like bars that had previously been allowed to restart operations.
“Statewide lockdowns that so many Americans lived under for months were intended to buy us time to get our act together,” Biden said in his speech. “Instead of using that time to prepare ourselves, Donald Trump squandered it.”
Biden, addressing the president, said that Americans had not made sacrifices “so you could ignore the science and turn responsible steps like wearing masks into a political statement.” Biden said last week that if he were president, he would use his authority to require people to wear masks in public.
“We absolutely need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public,” he said Tuesday. “Period.”
Biden’s criticism of the president was hardly limited to the coronavirus.
He assailed the president over reports that Russia had secretly offered bounties for killing U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan, saying that lawmakers should “demand the facts.”
He said Trump should have gathered officials to work out any discrepancies in the intelligence, consulted with military leaders and called President Vladimir Putin of Russia to warn him that “if any of this is true,” there would be a “big problem.”
Biden said of Trump: “The idea that somehow he didn’t know or isn’t being briefed, it is a dereliction of duty if that’s the case. And if he was briefed, and nothing was done about this, that’s a dereliction of duty.”
Biden said he expected to name a running mate by early August. Asked if he had started to prepare for debates against Trump, Biden said: “I can hardly wait.” And he offered a confident rejoinder to attacks from Trump and his allies over Biden’s mental capacity.
“I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I’m running against,” he said.
Biden was also asked about his view on removing statues and names of historical figures who have expressed racist ideas and sentiments.
He drew a distinction between figures such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson — both American presidents who had owned slaves — and those who had committed “treason” and were “trying to take down a union to keep slavery.”
He said Confederate monuments, for example, “belong in museums; they don’t belong in public places.” But other monuments and statues, like the Jefferson Memorial, serve more as a “remembrance,” he said, and should be protected.

Adidas Executive Resigns as Turmoil at Company Continues [With graphic(s)]

A top Adidas executive resigned on Tuesday, weeks after a number of Black employees pushed for her ouster amid a wider outcry over what they said were past acts of racism and discrimination at the company.
Karen Parkin, who is British, has been the only woman on Adidas’ six-person executive board since 2017, and was responsible for human resources across the company. She worked for Adidas for over 20 years in sales, business development and supply chain positions across Britain, the United States and at the company’s headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
“Her decision to leave the company reflects that commitment and her belief that a new HR leader will best drive forward the pace of change that Adidas needs at this time,” said Igor Landau, chairman of the company’s supervisory board, in a release announcing her resignation. Germany has a two-tiered board system in which a supervisory board is elected both by shareholders and employees, while the executive board runs the day-to-day operations of the company.
In a letter sent to employees and seen by The New York Times, Parkin acknowledged she had lost the trust of Adidas employees.
“While I would very much like to lead this critical transformation effort, after much reflection and listening to the feedback I’ve received, I have come to accept that I am not the right person to lead that change,” she wrote. “While I have always stood 100 percent against racism and discrimination and worked to create a more equitable environment, I recognize that the focus on me has become a hindrance inhibiting the company from moving forward.”
For weeks, a group of Adidas employees have held protests outside of the company’s North American headquarters in Portland, Oregon. They say the company’s top executives have fostered a culture that permitted racism and discrimination, and that they failed to invest in Black employees or respect Black culture while exploiting those two groups to sell shoes and apparel.
This month, Parkin, who is white, apologized for her response when describing how Adidas “viewed issues of race within our North American headquarters” during a meeting last year. Her apology came via a post on an internal company messaging system that was viewed by The New York Times.
It was a response to an open letter from Aaron Ture, a product manager at Reebok, an Adidas subsidiary based in Boston. In his letter, Ture described an all-company meeting held in Boston last August, in which Parkin, who lived in Portland but whose office was in Germany, was asked about racism within the company.
“This is noise we only hear in North America,” Ture recalled Parkin responding, though he acknowledged he could not remember her exact response word for word. “I do not believe there is an issue, so I do not feel the need to answer this question.”
Parkin’s apology — in which she wrote “should I have offended anyone, I apologize” — struck many employees as hollow.
“You’re willing to acknowledge your handling of the response was wrong, but cannot take full ownership and give a sincere apology?” one employee responded on the internal messaging system. “This is so disappointing.”
Another simply posted a link to the Wikipedia article for a non-apology apology.
In mid-June, dozens of Adidas employees sent a letter to the company’s supervisory board, asking it to investigate whether Parkin had taken the right approach to racism in the workplace, according to The Wall Street Journal.
An investigation by The New York Times a year ago revealed the company’s predominantly white leadership in Portland was struggling with issues of race and discrimination. And the company has stumbled in its response to the worldwide protests following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck. In late May, it posted on Instagram an image of the word “racism” crossed out, which was seen as ineffectual by many employees.
One group of mostly Black employees began working with the mostly white leadership in Portland on a list of demands — including more diverse hiring and an investment in the Black community — to present to executives in Germany, while another began daily noon protests outside of the company’s campus. Employees shared stories of discrimination and racist encounters on social media, in meetings and in open letters addressed to their superiors.
In response, Adidas pledged that 30% of its new hires would be Black or Latino. It also pledged to expand funding for programs that address racial disparities to $120 million over five years and to fund 50 college scholarships a year for Black students over the next five years.
And the company posted new images on Instagram, these stating unequivocally that “Black lives matter” and that “the success of adidas would be nothing without Black athletes, Black artists, Black employees and Black consumers. Period.”

Barack Obama abandona el retiro, obligado por la campaña de Trump [With graphic(s)]

El presidente número 44 de Estados Unidos anhelaba alejarse de la política. Tres años después, está de regreso.
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times.
Justo después de saber que Donald Trump había sido electo presidente, Barack Obama se desplomó en su silla del Despacho Oval y se dirigió a un asistente que estaba de pie cerca de un frutero con manzanas colocado en un lugar prominente, un emblema de su política de refrigerios saludables que, como tantas otras, estaba a punto de desaparecer.
“Ya estoy harto”, dijo Obama acerca de su trabajo, según varias personas familiarizadas con el intercambio
Pero él sabía, aún entonces, que un retiro convencional de la Casa Blanca no era opción. Obama, quien en ese momento tenía 55 años, se había quedado varado con la estafeta que planeaba pasarle a Hillary Clinton todavía en la mano. Encima debía lidiar con un sucesor que, creía, tenía una fijación en su contra basada en una extraña antipatía personal y una política de reacción racial violenta ejemplificada en la mentira sobre el lugar de nacimiento de Obama.
“No hay ningún modelo capaz de predecir el tipo de vida que tendré después de la presidencia”, le dijo Obama al asistente. “Es evidente que no puede dejar de pensar en mí”.
Lo que no quiere decir que Obama estuviera dispuesto a olvidar cómo había vislumbrado su retiro antes del triunfo de Trump: una vida plácida dedicada a escribir, disfrutar juegos de golf en días soleados, impulsar políticas a través de su fundación, producir documentales con Netflix y gozar mucho tiempo en familia en su nueva finca de 11,7 millones de dólares en Martha’s Vineyard.
De cualquier forma, más de tres años después de su salida, el 44.° presidente de Estados Unidos está otra vez en el campo de batalla político que tanto deseó abandonar. Lo obligan a participar en el enfrentamiento un enemigo empecinado en borrarlo de la historia —Trump—, y un amigo que ha demostrado la misma determinación por aprovechar su presencia, Joe Biden.
Era bien sabido que volver al campo de batalla sería muy arriesgado. Obama ha demostrado un gran interés en proteger su legado, en especial de los múltiples ataques de Trump. Pero después de realizar entrevistas con más de 50 personas que rodean al expresidente, el retrato que percibimos es el de un combatiente atribulado que intenta equilibrar el profundo enojo causado por su sucesor con el instinto de evitar el enfrentamiento por temor a que pudiera dañar su popularidad y afectar su lugar en la historia.
Sin embargo, es posible que el cálculo de ese equilibrio haya comenzado a cambiar tras el asesinato de George Floyd a manos de la policía en Mineápolis. Como el primer presidente negro de Estados Unidos, ahora el primer ex-presidente negro, Obama ve la concientización social y racial actual como una oportunidad para darle un valor más significativo a las elecciones de 2020, que habían estado marcadas por el estilo de lucha sucia de Trump, y canalizar un nuevo movimiento juvenil hacia un objetivo político, como sucedió en 2008.
Actúa con cautela, con su intención característica de mantener la calma, ser fiel a su reputación, conservar su capital político y mantener intactas sus aspiraciones de un retiro tranquilo.
“No creo que tenga dudas. Más bien, creo que ha adoptado una actitud estratégica”, señaló Dan Pfeiffer, uno de sus principales asesores durante más de una década. “Siempre ha usado su voz de manera estratégica; es su posesión más valiosa”.
Obama también está atento a un ejemplo aleccionador: en 2008, los ataques de Bill Clinton en su contra fracasaron de tal manera que el personal de campaña de su esposa tuvo que reducir sus apariciones.
Muchos seguidores ejercen cada vez más presión para que sea más agresivo.
“Para variar, sería bueno que Barack Obama saliera de su cueva y ofreciera (o más bien EXIGIERA) una ruta para seguir adelante”, escribió el columnista Drew Magary en una publicación de Medium que se ha compartido muchísimo desde su aparición en abril con el título ¿Dónde diablos está Barack Obama? .
El argumento para rebatir esta postura es que Obama cumplió su trabajo y merece que lo dejen en paz.
“Obama ha estado fuera del cargo durante tres años y medio, y todavía se enfrenta a este tipo de escrutinio: nadie está presionando de la misma manera a ex presidentes blancos como George W. Bush y Jimmy Carter”, dijo Monique Judge, editora de noticias de la revista en línea The Root y autora de un artículo de 2018 que argumentaba que Obama ya no le debía nada al país.
Obama mismo parece posicionarse en algún lugar intermedio. No planea descartar sus vacaciones de verano en Vineyard y todavía le preocupa la fecha de publicación de su esperada autobiografía. No obstante, la semana pasada redobló sus críticas “indirectas” al gobierno de Trump cuando condenó el “enfoque de gobierno caótico, desorganizado y malintencionado” durante un evento en línea para recaudar fondos para Biden. Además, expresó una especie de compromiso cuando les dijo a los seguidores de Biden: “Lo que han hecho hasta ahora no ha sido suficiente. Y lo mismo va para mí, para Michelle y para nuestras hijas”.
El 25 de junio, durante un evento de recaudación por Zoom accesible solo con invitación, Obama expresó su indignación porque el presidente utilizó las frases “ kung flu ” y “China virus” para describir al coronavirus. “No quiero un país en el que el presidente de Estados Unidos promueva de manera activa la discriminación contra los asiáticos y encima le parezca gracioso. No quiero eso. Todavía me da escalofríos y me enfurece”, dijo Obama, según una transcripción de sus comentarios proporcionada por alguien que participó en el evento.
Obama habla frecuentemente con el exvicepresidente y los principales asesores de la campaña para darles sugerencias sobre el personal y los mensajes. En mayo le aconsejó sin rodeos a Biden mantener sus discursos cortos, hacer entrevistas entusiastas y recortar la extensión de sus tuits, pues lo mejor es hacer que la campaña funcione como un referendo sobre Trump y la economía, según algunos funcionarios demócratas.
Los funcionarios mencionaron que un aspecto de particular interés para el expresidente Obama es la operación digital de Biden, que está en preparación y para la cual ha buscado que aliados poderosos como el fundador de LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, y el exdirector ejecutivo de Google, Eric Schmidt, compartan sus conocimientos.
Con todo, todavía se toma su tiempo para responder a algunas solicitudes, en especial las que se refieren a encabezar más actividades de recaudación de fondos. Algunos colaboradores de Obama dieron a entender que no quiere eclipsar al candidato, pero los partidarios de Biden no están convencidos de que sea así.
“Por favor, que venga y nos eclipse”, bromeó uno de ellos.
‘Obama no podrá descansar’
Desde el momento en que se anunció el triunfo de Trump, Obama adoptó un enfoque minimalista: criticaba sus decisiones de políticas públicas, pero no al hombre que las tomaba, un comportamiento conforme a la norma de civilidad observada por sus predecesores, en especial George W. Bush.
El problema es que para Trump las normas no significan nada. Desde un principio dejó muy claro que quería erradicar cualquier rastro de la presencia de Obama en el Ala Oeste. “Tenía el peor gusto”, le dijo Trump a un visitante a principios de 2017 mientras presumía sus nuevas cortinas (que no eran muy distintas de las de Obama, en opinión de otras personas que entraron al despacho durante ese periodo caótico).
Esos esfuerzos por hacerlo desaparecer fueron más enfáticos en lo referente a las políticas. Un exfuncionario de la Casa Blanca comentó que Trump interrumpió una presentación para verificar que una propuesta del personal no fuera “una cosa de Obama”.
Durante la transición, en lo que en retrospectiva parece un anticipo de la presidencia, a un colaborador de Trump se le ocurrió imprimir una lista detallada de las promesas de campaña de Obama del sitio web oficial de la Casa Blanca y utilizarla como una especie de lista de objetivos a abatir, según dos personas con conocimiento de la medida.
“Es algo personal para Trump; todo se trata del presidente Obama y de acabar con su legado. Es su obsesión”, explicó Omarosa Manigault Newman, veterana del programa Apprentice y, hasta su abrupta salida, una de las contadas funcionarias negras en el Ala Oeste de Trump. “El presidente Obama no podrá descansar mientras Trump respire”.
Cuando los dos hombres se encontraron en noviembre de 2016 para una forzada reunión posterior a la elección, el presidente electo fue cortés, por lo que Obama aprovechó la oportunidad para aconsejarle no desmantelar Obamacare. “Mira, puedes quitarle mi nombre; no me importa”, le dijo, según los asesores.
Trump asintió sin comprometerse.
Cuando la transición comenzó a hacerse eterna, Obama experimentó una creciente inquietud ante una actitud que le parecía la alegre indiferencia del nuevo presidente y su equipo de novatos. Muchos de ellos ignoraron por completo los documentos de información que el personal de Obama había preparado con tanto empeño, recuerdan sus antiguos colaboradores, y en lugar de centrarse en la política o en el funcionamiento del Ala Oeste, preguntaron por la calidad de los tacos en el comedor del sótano o dónde encontrar un buen apartamento.
En cuanto a Trump, no tiene “ni la menor idea de qué está haciendo”, Obama le dijo a un asistente después de su encuentro en el Despacho Oval.
Jared Kushner, yerno y asesor cercano de Trump, causó una impresión igualmente imborrable. Durante un recorrido por el edificio preguntó abruptamente: “Entonces, ¿cuántas de estas personas se quedan?”.
La respuesta fue ninguna, respondió su escolta. (Los funcionarios del Ala Oeste sirven a gusto del presidente, como Trump dejaría claro ampliamente en los siguientes meses).
Cuando la historia de Kushner fue transmitida a Obama, recuerdan los asesores, se rió y la repitió a sus amigos, e incluso a algunos periodistas, para ilustrar a qué se enfrentaba el país.
Un portavoz de la Casa Blanca no negó el relato, pero sugirió que Kushner podría haber hablado del personal de seguridad y mantenimiento en lugar de los nombramientos políticos.
Durante otras conversaciones con editores que respetaba, incluidos David Remnick de The New Yorker y Jeffrey Goldberg de The Atlantic, Obama se mostró más reflexivo, según personas familiarizadas con las interacciones. A veces, flotaba alguna versión de esta pregunta: ¿Podría haber hecho algo para mitigar la reacción violenta de Trump?
Barack Obama finalmente llegó a la conclusión de que era una inevitabilidad histórica, y le dijo a las personas a su alrededor que lo mejor que podía hacer era “establecer un contraejemplo”.
Otros pensaron que necesitaba hacer más. Durante la transición, Paulette Aniskoff, asistente veterana en el Ala Oeste, comenzó a formar una organización política con antiguos asesores para ayudar a Obama a defender su legado, colaborar con otros demócratas y planear sus actividades de respaldo en las elecciones intermedias de 2018.
Aunque se mostró abierto al planteamiento, lo que más le interesaba a Obama eran las salidas. “Haré lo que me pidan”, le dijo al equipo de Aniskoff, pero les pidió identificar y descartar con cuidado las apariciones que pudieran ser una pérdida de tiempo o un despilfarro de su capital político.
Entonces como ahora, Obama estaba tan determinado a evitar mencionar el nombre del nuevo presidente que un colaborador en broma sugirió que hicieran referencia a él como “el que no debe ser nombrado”, en alusión al archienemigo de Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort.
Por su parte, Trump no tenía el menor problema en mencionar nombres. En marzo de 2017, acusó en falso a Obama de haber ordenado que se vigilaran las oficinas generales de su campaña, como dijo en un tuit: “¡Qué bajo ha caído el presidente Obama, que intervino mis teléfonos durante el sagrado proceso de las elecciones! Es Nixon/Watergate. ¡Qué tipo malvado (o enfermo)!”.
Fue algo así como un punto de inflexión. Obama les dijo a Aniskoff y su equipo que hablaría de su sucesor en las elecciones intermedias de 2018. Pero no mucho.
Fue muy reveladora la forma en que Obama habló de Trump ese otoño: no tanto como una persona sino como una especie de padecimiento epidemiológico que sufría el cuerpo político, diseminado por sus secuaces republicanos.
“No empezó con Donald Trump; él es más bien un síntoma, no la causa”, afirmó durante su discurso inicial en la Universidad de Illinois en septiembre de 2018. Añadió que el sistema político estadounidense no gozaba de “salud” suficiente para formar los “anticuerpos” necesarios y combatir el contagio del “nacionalismo racial”.
La pandemia, si acaso, lo ha hecho más partidario de la comparación.
El virus, dijo durante su aparición con Biden la semana pasada, “es una metáfora” para mucho más.
Al golf le va ‘mejor que a mi libro’
Obama consideró que una de las mejores maneras de salvaguardar su legado era escribir su libro, que imaginó tanto como una crónica detallada de su presidencia como un seguimiento literario a sus muy elogiadas memorias de 1995, Los sueños de mi padr e.
A fines de 2016, el agente de Obama, Bob Barnett, comenzó a negociar un acuerdo global para las memorias de Obama y la autografía de Michelle Obama. Random House finalmente ganó la guerra de ofertas con una propuesta récord de 65 millones de dólares.
El proceso ha sido un castigo dorado. A un ex funcionario de la Casa Blanca que se comunicó con él a mediados de 2018 Obama le dijo que el proyecto “era como hacer la tarea”.
Otro asociado, que se encontró con el ex presidente en un evento el año pasado, comentó cuán en forma se veía. Obama respondió: “Digamos que a mi juego de golf le va mucho mejor que a mi libro”.
No fue especialmente fácil para el ex presidente ver cómo el libro de su esposa, Mi historia , se publicó en 2018 y rápidamente se convirtió en un éxito de ventas internacional.
“Ella tuvo un escritor fantasma”, le dijo Obama a un amigo que le preguntó sobre el trabajo veloz de su esposa. “Estoy escribiendo cada palabra yo mismo, y es por eso que me está tomando más tiempo”.
La fecha de lanzamiento libro sigue siendo uno de los temas más delicados. Obama, un escritor deliberado propenso a la procrastinación —y a largas digresiones— insistió en que no haya un plazo establecido, según varias personas al tanto del proceso.
En una entrevista poco después de que Obama dejó el cargo, uno de sus asesores más cercanos había predicho que el libro saldría a mediados de 2019, antes de que las elecciones primarias comenzaran en serio, una opción preferida por muchos que trabajan en el proyecto.
Pero Obama no terminó y no circuló un borrador de entre 600 y 800 páginas sino hasta cerca de Año Nuevo, demasiado tarde para publicar antes de las elecciones, de acuerdo con conocedores de la situación
Ahora considera seriamente dividir el proyecto en dos volúmenes, con la esperanza de publicarlo rápidamente, antes de las elecciones, quizás a tiempo para la temporada navideña, según personas cercanas al proceso.
La otra gran empresa creativa de Obama, un acuerdo multimillonario de 2018 con Netflix para producir documentales y películas con su esposa, ha sido un estimulante, y, en comparación, un trabajo rápido.
Obama disfrutó la revisión de decenas de proyectos potenciales y ofreció sugerencias específicas —garabateadas en la libreta amarilla que usa para escribir su libro— a directores y escritores. Su compañía de producción, Higher Ground Productions, tiene un pequeño bungalow en un estudio de Hollywood que una vez fue hogar de la compañía de Charlie Chaplin. El expresidente pasó un día entrometiéndose con el trabajo del reducido personal durante una visita en noviembre.
Uno de los primeros proyectos fue Crip Camp , un galardonado documental sobre un campamento de verano en el estado de Nueva York, fundado a inicios de los años 70, que se convirtió en un punto focal del movimiento por los derechos de las personas con discapacidad.
Obama vio el proyecto como un vehículo para su visión del cambio político de base, y proporcionó retroalimentación durante los 18 meses que duró la producción de la película.
“Vimos imágenes que los cineastas habían comenzado a editar y se las enviamos al presidente para que las viera”, dijo Priya Swaminathan, codirectora de Higher Ground. “Quería saber cómo podríamos ayudar a los realizadores a hacer de este el mejor relato de la historia y ellos se involucraron en la colaboración. Vimos muchos, muchos cortes juntos”.
Un momento ‘a la medida’
Parte de lo que Obama encuentra tan atractivo sobre el cine es que le permite controlar la narrativa. En ese sentido, la campaña de 2020 ha sido una experiencia desorientadora: se supone que su carrera política ha terminado, pero tiene un papel semi-protagonista en una producción que no ha escrito ni dirigido.
Esa leve frustración ha sido más evidente en su complicada relación con Biden, quien al mismo tiempo codicia su apoyo y está firmemente decidido a triunfar en la elección por cuenta propia.
Obama apoyó a Biden, personalmente, desde el inicio de la campaña, pero le prometió al senador Bernie Sanders, en una de sus primeras conversaciones, que su profesión pública de neutralidad era genuina y que no estaba trabajando en secreto para elegir a su amigo, según un funcionario del partido al tanto del intercambio.
Además, Obama siempre ha tenido claras las vulnerabilidades de su amigo, instando a los ayudantes de Biden a asegurarse de que no “pase por una situación embarazosa” o “dañe su legado”, gane o pierda.
Cuando un donante demócrata planteó la cuestión de la edad de Biden a fines del año pasado —tiene 77 años— Obama reconoció esas preocupaciones y dijo: “Ni siquiera tenía 50 años cuando fui elegido, y ese trabajo consumió cada gramo de energía que tenía”, según la persona.
Aún así, es un partidario entusiasta y jugó un papel central al presionar a Sanders para que “acelere el final del juego” que llevó a la victoria antes de lo esperado de Biden, en abril. Las siguientes semanas las dedicó a arreglar algunos cabos sueltos políticos, trabajar para mejorar su relación con la senadora Elizabeth Warren, quien lo molestó al criticar sus conferencias pagadas en Wall Street como emblemáticas del flagelo del dinero en la política, al describirlo como una “serpiente que se desliza por Washington”.
Sus asistentes insisten que nunca ha visto la campaña de Biden como una guerra indirecta entre él y Trump. Sin embargo, le entusiasman las métricas desequilibradas de la competencia en los últimos tiempos.
Obama supervisa de cerca sus respectivos números electorales —obtiene datos de circulación privada del Comité Nacional Demócrata—y se enorgullece con el hecho de que tiene muchos más millones de seguidores en Twitter que el presidente que confía en la plataforma mucho más que él, dijeron personas cercanas.
El expresidente devora las noticias en línea, y recurre constantemente a las páginas web de The New York Times, The Washington Post y The Atlantic desde su iPad, y conserva el horario noctámbulo de sus días en la Casa Blanca: envía mensajes de textos y enlaces a historias a sus amigos entre la medianoche y las dos de la mañana. Incluso durante la pandemia se levanta temprano, al menos entre semana, y con frecuencia está en su bicicleta Peloton a las ocho de la mañana, cuando envía otra nueva ronda de mensajes de texto, a menudo sobre el último escándalo de Trump.
Obama ya estaba intensificando su crítica a Trump antes del asesinato de Floyd en mayo. Aniskoff organizó una reunión en línea con 3000 exfuncionarios del gobierno cuyo propósito, en parte, era suavizar su línea más dura. (Demócratas cercanos a Obama filtraron amablemente la grabación de sus observaciones).
El creciente clamor de justicia racial le ha dado a la campaña de 2020 la coherencia que necesitaba Obama, un político que se siente más cómodo si puede disfrazar sus críticas contra un oponente —ya sea Hillary Clinton o Donald Trump— con lenguaje a favor de un movimiento.
La primera reacción de Obama a las manifestaciones, según sus colaboradores cercanos, fue de ansiedad, pues temía que los brotes de vandalismo se salieran de control y respaldaran la narrativa de Trump de una izquierda anárquica.
Por fortuna, los manifestantes pacíficos asumieron el control y despertaron un movimiento nacional que representó un reto para Trump sin convertir al presidente en su punto focal.
Poco después, durante una llamada estratégica con colaboradores políticos y expertos en políticas de su fundación, Obama dijo emocionado que había llegado “un momento hecho a la medida”.
Obama ha estado últimamente en contacto cercano con su primer fiscal general, Eric H. Holder Jr., compartiendo su indignación por la manera en que el actual fiscal general, William P. Barr, inspeccionó personalmente la falange de los agentes federales del orden público que lanzaron gases lacrimógenos a manifestantes para despejar el paso a la caminata de Trump para hacerse una foto en una iglesia histórica cerca de la Casa Blanca.
Holder tiene pocos reparos en llamar a Trump de racista en frente del expresidente. Obama nunca lo contradijo, pero evita el término, incluso en privado, y prefiere una acusación más indirecta de “demagogia racial”, según varias personas cercanas a ambos.
Su respuesta al asesinato de Floyd no consistió en atacar a Trump, sino en alentar a votar a los jóvenes, que no han mostrado gran entusiasmo por apoyar a Biden. Cuando decidió hablar en público fue para encabezar un foro en línea para destacar una lista de reformas a la policía que no prosperaron durante su segundo mandato.
En ese sentido, el papel en el que se desempeña con más comodidad es el cargo del que llegó a estar harto en cierto momento.
El 4 de junio, más o menos una hora antes de las honras fúnebres de Floyd en Mineápolis, el expresidente llamó al hermano de este, Philonise Floyd, del mismo modo que hizo con las familias en duelo durante sus ocho años en el cargo.
“Quiero que tengas esperanza. Quiero que sepas que no estás solo. Quiero que sepas que Michelle y yo haremos todo lo que quieras que haga”, dijo Obama durante la emotiva conversación de 25 minutos, según el reverendo Al Sharpton, que estaba presente. Otras dos personas con conocimiento de la llamada confirmaron su contenido.
“Esa fue la primera vez, creo, que la familia Floyd realmente experimentó consuelo desde que él murió”, dijo Sharpton en una entrevista.

MINNEAPOLIS — The judge overseeing the case against four former Minneapolis police officers in the death of George Floyd told lawyers and local officials on Monday to be careful about what they say, warning that too much publicity could make it difficult to choose an impartial jury.
While stopping short of issuing a formal gag order, Judge Peter A. Cahill of Hennepin County District Court warned that he would consider moving the trial if the parties involved leak information or offer opinions to the news media about the guilt or innocence of the defendants.
“From this day forward, everyone has had their warning,” Cahill said.
Lawyers for the officers cited “multiple inappropriate public comments” from local officials that they said had already prejudiced potential jurors, including a statement last week from the Minneapolis police chief that the killing of Floyd was murder, not a failure of training. They argued that the court proceedings should be broadcast publicly as a countermeasure.
“The state’s conduct made a fair and unbiased trial extremely unlikely, and the defendants seek video and audio coverage to let a cleansing light shine on these proceedings,” Thomas C. Plunkett, a lawyer for one of the officers, wrote in a motion.
The case, which set off worldwide protests after Floyd’s death in police custody on May 25, has already generated an enormous amount of publicity; one defense lawyer said it was probably the most famous case in Minnesota history.
Monday’s hearing, which lasted roughly an hour, was the first time all four defendants appeared in court on the same day, although each did so separately. None of the former officers, who were all fired after Floyd’s killing, have entered pleas.
Derek Chauvin, the 19-year police veteran who pinned his knee to Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes, faces the most serious charges of second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He appeared first on Monday, by video conference from prison.
The three other officers, charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, also appeared one by one. Two of them, out on bail, did so in person, while another appeared from a jail holding cell. None of the defendants said anything more than “Yes, your honor” when asked if they agreed to waive their right to a speedy trial, which is scheduled to begin in the spring.
Two of Floyd’s relatives, an aunt and an uncle, were in the courtroom and at one point were admonished by the judge for reacting to statements made in court.
Speaking to reporters later outside the court, Selwyn Jones, 54, Floyd’s uncle, said: “I know how the system works. I’ve seen the system my whole life — a black man getting shaded, slighted. When I walk into a courthouse and I see like 15 white people, I’m like, ‘Oh hell, we’re going through this again.’ So, we’ll see how the process ends up.”
He added: “I’m not mad at anyone. We just need to fix the system. Racism must go.”
On Friday, Cahill had banned video and audio coverage of the proceedings, worried it could taint the pool of potential jurors. But at Monday’s hearing, he said the court was studying how to allow cameras to film the upcoming trial.
Lawyers for the officers had filed a motion asking the judge to allow video coverage, arguing that doing so would provide greater public access to the proceedings in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Several news organizations, including The New York Times, had also filed motions for video and audio access to the court.
The arguments over allowing cameras in the courtroom, even as the video of Floyd’s killing is in wide circulation, underscored what is likely to be one of the most vexing and contested issues as the case inches toward trial: how to seat an impartial jury.
But that remains far off. The judge set the next hearing in the case for Sept. 11, and a trial date of March 8. In the coming months, the court will decide whether to hold four separate trials, or if the four former officers will be tried together.
The demonstrations that followed Floyd’s killing spread to all 50 states and around the world. Outrage and anguish over another black man dying at the hands of the police quickly grew into a broad examination of racism in all its forms, inciting America’s most sustained period of civil unrest in decades.
Officials in Minneapolis and elsewhere have scrambled to meet the demands of protesters, with proposals to shift funds from police departments to other social programs, institute reforms such as banning chokeholds, and hold officers accountable in court for unlawful uses of force. In Minneapolis, a majority of the City Council has vowed to dismantle the Police Department and reimagine public safety.
On Sunday, Mayor Jacob Frey and the police chief, Medaria Arradondo, announced what they described as the first in a series of police reforms: prohibiting officers involved in incidents from reviewing body camera footage before completing an initial report.
“Requiring officers who may become suspects to complete a police report before reviewing bodycam footage will help ensure that investigators, attorneys and jurors receive a transparent account of how an officer remembers the incident — one that hasn’t been influenced by other evidence,” the officials said in a statement.
Chauvin, 44, is being held on at least $1 million bail in Floyd’s death. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the murder and manslaughter charges. Two other defendants, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, both junior officers, are out on bail. Another former officer, Tou Thao, remains in custody.
Already, lawyers for Lane and Kueng have sought to shift the blame to Chauvin. At an earlier hearing, Plunkett pointed to Chauvin’s culpability, saying, “at multiple times, Mr. Kueng and Mr. Lane directed their attention to that 19-year veteran and said, ‘You shouldn’t do this.’ ” Thao had met with prosecutors before Chauvin’s arrest.
Taken together, their actions indicate that the so-called blue wall of silence — officers sticking to the same story, and not speaking out against one another — has already crumbled.

MINNEAPOLIS — Four former police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd, whose death set off worldwide protests, will participate in a pretrial hearing Monday, as the criminal case against them inches forward. Yet members of the public — unless they get one of the small number of socially distanced seats in the courtroom — will be unable to watch.
The judge in the case Friday banned video and audio coverage of the proceedings, worried it could taint the pool of potential jurors.
Lawyers for the officers had filed a motion asking the judge to allow video coverage, arguing that doing so would provide greater public access to the proceedings in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
They also cited “multiple inappropriate public comments” from local officials — including a statement from the police chief that the killing of Floyd was “murder” — that they said had already prejudiced potential jurors.
“The state’s conduct made a fair and unbiased trial extremely unlikely, and the defendants seek video and audio coverage to let a cleansing light shine on these proceedings,” wrote Thomas C. Plunkett, a lawyer for one of the officers, in a motion.
Several news organizations, including The New York Times, had also filed motions for video and audio access to the court.
The arguments over video cameras in the courtroom, even as the video of Floyd’s killing is in wide circulation, underscored what is likely to be one of the most vexing and contested issues as the case inches toward trial: how to seat an impartial jury.
But jury selection is still far off in a trial that might not begin until spring. The death of Floyd, who gasped for air as he was pinned under an officer’s knee for more than eight minutes, was captured by a bystander on a cellphone video that quickly went viral, sparking weeks of protests against police brutality and racism.
The demonstrations, which spread to all 50 states and around the world, began as outrage and anguish over another Black man dying at the hands of police. But demands for justice and police accountability quickly grew into a broad reckoning with racism in all its forms, with America’s most sustained period of civil unrest in decades.
Officials in Minneapolis and elsewhere have scrambled to meet the demands of protesters, proposing to shift funds from police departments to other social programs, institute reforms such as banning chokeholds and hold officers accountable in court for unlawful uses of force. In Minneapolis, a majority of the City Council has vowed to dismantle the Police Department and reimagine how to manage public safety.
On Sunday, Mayor Jacob Frey and the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, announced what they described as the first in a series of police reforms: prohibiting officers involved in incidents from reviewing body camera footage before completing an initial report.
“Requiring officers who may become suspects to complete a police report before reviewing bodycam footage will help ensure that investigators, attorneys and jurors receive a transparent account of how an officer remembers the incident — one that hasn’t been influenced by other evidence,” the officials said in a statement.
At the pretrial hearing scheduled for Monday afternoon at a jail and court complex in central Minneapolis, all four defendants in the Floyd case are expected to participate either in person or by video from jail. At the hearing, a variety of issues are likely to be discussed; they could include adjustments to bail, arguments over a gag order limiting trial participants from speaking to the media and a trial schedule. The defendants are not likely to enter pleas Monday.
Derek Chauvin, 44, a 19-year-veteran whose knee pinned Floyd to the ground until his last breaths, is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and is being held on at least $1 million bail. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. Three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting in the death. Two of them, both junior officers — Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng — are out on bail. Another officer, Tou Thao, remains in custody, said his lawyer.
For now, the four former officers’ cases are being handled together. But they could ultimately be split up and tried separately. Already, lawyers for Lane and Kueng have sought to shift the blame to Chauvin. At an earlier hearing, Plunkett pointed to Chauvin’s culpability, saying, “at multiple times, Kueng and Lane directed their attention to that 19-year veteran and said, ‘You shouldn’t do this.’ ” Thao had met with prosecutors before Chauvin’s arrest.
Taken together, the actions of the three officers indicate that the so-called blue wall of silence — officers sticking together to the same story and not speaking out against one another — has already crumbled.
Floyd, 46, died May 25 after officers responded to a 911 call from a worker at Cup Foods, a convenience store in south Minneapolis, complaining that Floyd had tried to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Kueng and Lane were the first officers to show up but were unable to secure the arrest when Floyd resisted getting into their squad car, saying he was claustrophobic.
Then Chauvin and Thao arrived, and minutes later Floyd was on his stomach, laying on the ground. Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd’s neck, while Kueng held his back and Lane his legs.
As a bystander filmed the unfolding events, and a crowd of others pleaded with the officers to stop, Floyd, with minutes left of his life, repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe.”

NEW YORK — A sweeping red-glass staircase in the heart of Times Square that is a magnet for selfie-snapping tourists has been barricaded off.
There are calls for one-way sidewalks on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the concrete is too narrow to keep people 6 feet apart.
Tables for two and potted trees may soon replace cars along Arthur Avenue, the heart of Little Italy in the Bronx, where restaurants are turning to curbside dining so customers can spread out.
The rigorous social distancing that has beaten back the coronavirus is being put to its biggest test yet as New York City eases restrictions after a three-month shutdown. Though still far from normal, empty streets and sidewalks are starting to fill with commuters, plazas are getting visitors, and playgrounds are bustling with children.
The pandemic, which has taken away so much already, has created new challenges for public places that are, by design, meant to be shared by everyone and are central to cities like New York, where limited space forces people together.
New York City has vastly expanded its network of public spaces over the past two decades — including new showcase parks and pedestrian plazas carved from streets — that serve as the backyard for countless New Yorkers who live in small apartments.
While these spaces have made the city more vibrant, they also draw crowds that now make them a public health threat.
Some states that have reopened faster than New York, including Florida, Texas and Arizona, have seen a surge in coronavirus cases as people have headed back to beaches, shopping malls and other public places.
“Everyone is desperate to encourage public activity, but how to do it safely with a less than perfect understanding of how risky is risky?” said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an influential planning group.
Even before New York City, which became an epicenter of the pandemic, officially began reopening June 8, the streets were filled with demonstrators protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
And as virus fatigue set in, people increasingly flouted social distancing rules: going maskless in public, crowding around bars and cutting chains on playgrounds before they were officially reopened.
City and state officials face additional hurdles as offices start reopening, bringing out thousands more workers, and as outdoor service begins at hard-hit restaurants that are often squeezed into tight spaces.
An outdoor dining plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio allows restaurants to expand seating outdoors on sidewalks and in parking lanes and plazas. Restaurants will soon be able to use streets that have already been closed to traffic.
And outdoor dining may take on greater significance after the mayor and Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday suggested that indoor dining, which was supposed to resume as early as July 6, could be delayed.
In response to the pandemic, the city closed 44 miles of its 6,000 miles of streets to traffic, allowing for walking, biking and social distancing, under pressure from residents and transportation advocates. The mayor announced last week that an additional 23 miles of streets would be closed.
Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, said the pandemic had given people a chance to take ownership of their streets and have more say in how they should be used. “It has brought forward a desire to see city streets used in more open and creative ways,” she said.
But with little official guidance from the city on public spaces beyond streets and outdoor dining, many business and community groups have been left to figure out how to keep people safe.
Some Upper East Side residents have called for one-way sidewalks. “The stressful part of going anywhere is getting there, because the sidewalks are so narrow,” said City Councilman Ben Kallos, who represents parts of the neighborhood and Roosevelt Island. “There’s no room for distancing, especially when people are walking toward you.”
City transportation officials said that while they appreciated the creative proposal, it was not practical and could require people to cross additional streets to get where they were going.
Some businesses, anticipating that checkpoints to screen workers for the virus would create lines that spill onto sidewalks, are considering staggering work hours; asking employees to take stairs instead of waiting for elevators; and installing cameras that automatically flag people with high temperatures, said Margaret Newman, a principal at Arup, a design and consulting firm.
Some of the city’s most popular plazas and parks have already taken steps to prevent crowding, including removing chairs and tables. Along Broadway in the garment district in Manhattan, only about one-third of the chairs have been put out. Sidewalk stickers placed 6 feet apart outside stores and restaurants show people where to stand.
Times Square, one of the most famous gathering spots in the world, draws up to 450,000 people daily. The cascade of 27 ruby-red glass steps, which seats hundreds at a time, has been closed indefinitely. Dozens of theater-inspired signs remind visitors of social-distancing rules, including one that says, “Phantom of the Opera: popularizing masks since 1986.”
In Bryant Park, another crowded space in the heart of Manhattan, there is a limit of three people in each bathroom. Drinking water fountains have been converted into hand-washing sinks. Chess players are encouraged to sit at separate tables with separate chessboards and call out moves to each other. And when the carousel reopens, children will be seated on every other horse.
In Central Park, police officers will restrict entry into the lush, 15-acre lawn known as Sheep Meadow when it becomes crowded. In Brooklyn Bridge Park, fitness classes and basketball and volleyball games have been suspended. Nearby in Domino Park, the lawn has been divided into 30 white circles, each 8 feet in diameter and spaced 6 feet apart. A park worker reminds people to stay inside their own circle.
“We found it was the lowest common denominator; it was the simplest solution to separate people,” said Michael Lampariello, the park’s director, who fields inquiries about replicating the circles in other cities.
Still, many people overseeing public spaces say there is only so much they can do to maintain social distancing.
“We want the city to offer up guidelines and some degree of enforcement to help us comanage these public spaces,” said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, which manages Times Square.
City planning officials, who regulate hundreds of privately owned public spaces in some of New York’s busiest neighborhoods, said they would soon release a plan to make social distancing possible.
Jerold S. Kayden, a professor of urban planning and design at Harvard University, said that in many cities, public spaces were created largely piecemeal rather than through a master plan and are overseen by a patchwork of government agencies and private property owners. “We need to think of public spaces in total,” he said. “They’re all part of the solution, and we need to think about them in the same way.”
Leaders of business improvement districts lobbied city officials to expedite the authorization process for outdoor dining. By Sunday, more than 6,000 restaurants had applied, including 3,000 in Manhattan.
“Outdoor seating is a lifeline,” said Michael McNamee, an owner of PMac’s Hospitality Group, which has several Manhattan restaurants, including Dutch Fred’s and Tanner Smith’s in midtown. “We need customers to feel happy and confident in our ability to have a secure and virus-free environment.”
Moving dining tables outside would not offset the losses from reducing indoor capacity, McNamee said, but it would allow his restaurants to bring back up to 50% of their employees.
In the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, known as the borough’s Little Italy, the business improvement district is planning to transform a stretch of Arthur Avenue into an Italian piazza in the evenings with tables on the sidewalk and part of the street, while still allowing room for emergency vehicles.
“Getting people back working is our first priority, but with that comes the reattachment of the limbs here that make us whole,” said Peter Madonia, chairman of the Belmont Business Improvement District and a third-generation owner of Madonia Bakery on Arthur Avenue. “This is deeply personal for me as well as professionally.”
Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, recently took Trottenberg, the transportation commissioner, on a neighborhood tour, pointing out where tables and seats could be brought outdoors, including one spot outside Junior’s Restaurant, which is famous for its cheesecake.
“Having Junior’s reopen,” Myer said, “would be a huge symbol for the borough.”
In Queens, some property owners in Long Island City are considering helping their tenants by using spaces in private parking lots for outdoor restaurant seating.
“You get a foot here, and you get a foot there,” said Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership. “And hopefully, it adds up to something usable.”
Kayden, the professor, said some of the new ideas and measures could outlast the pandemic and fundamentally change the way that public spaces are designed.
“Everybody is rethinking their public spaces,” he said. “A lot of people are using this crisis as an opportunity to say we want more and better public spaces.”

Since the day he was sworn into office, President Donald Trump has pursued policies and practiced politics with a single-minded focus on bedrock Republicans, showing little interest in appealing to independent voters. That has made him one of the most powerful figures ever in his party and rewarded him with strong conservative support in his reelection campaign.
But Trump’s focus on his base at the expense of swing voters, who have historically been a key target for presidential campaigns, is almost certainly not enough to win him a second term in the White House, as even some Republicans concede.
A national poll of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College shows Trump drawing 36% of the vote, a far cry from the 46% he won in 2016. Perhaps even more troubling for Trump is that he has not assembled a broad coalition of voters, which is critical to winning battleground states. While Republicans support him overwhelmingly, he has the support of just 29% of independents and nonaffiliated voters — 18 points behind Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent. Trump narrowly won independents in 2016, according to exit polls.
Whether Trump can still expand his support at this point, especially in the battleground states that are crucial to his Electoral College calculus, is an enormous challenge that the president, to date, has shown little interest in meeting. Much of the nation has recoiled from Trump’s brash conduct and harsh language in office and at the same time has moved to the left on health care, civil rights, same-sex marriage and other issues.
“He is losing, and if he doesn’t change course, both in terms of the substance of what he is discussing and the way that he approaches the American people, then he will lose,” Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey and a former close adviser to Trump, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”
The coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide social unrest have all contributed to Trump’s diminished standing, including among swing voters — only 17% of independents strongly approve of Trump’s job performance, the poll shows.
“It’s not enough to win reelection,” Sara Fagen, who was the White House political director for President George W. Bush, said of tactics focused on turning out the base. “In this environment, it will be difficult to win an election without expanding the number of people who support you.”
Trump has told advisers and allies that he has to run as himself and that he has defied polling experts before, pointing to 2016. He won the presidency despite losing the popular vote, with narrow wins in three states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — that gave him an Electoral College victory.
In that first race he sought to appeal primarily to Republican voters, but his defiant, outsider message, with its emphasis on trade and immigration, drew Americans alienated by Washington, hungry for a change after eight years of Democratic rule and put off by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent.
But Trump is facing a decidedly different electoral landscape this time around. The Times/Siena poll found 9% of registered voters were undecided and presumably fall into the category of persuadable voters. They, like much of the country, hold unfavorable views of Trump’s job performance, and particularly his response to the pandemic and to the demonstrations that followed the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police.
“I’m not a huge Biden fan. I think he’s a career politician and a member of the donor class,” said John-Crichton McCutcheon, 50, from Miami Beach, who voted for Trump last time and responded to the Times/Siena poll of voters in battleground states. “But with Trump, things have gotten so bad, I’m going to have to go with Biden.”
Donna Saylor, 67, a Democrat and a nurse who lives in Pittston, Pennsylvania, voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 and for Trump in 2016. “Unfortunately,” she said of her support for Trump. She intends to vote for Biden in November.
“I’m definitely not happy with Trump,” she said in an interview this month. “Every time he opens his mouth, it causes trouble. He’s not unifying this country as he should be; he’s dividing it.”
Trump has governed and led with a focus on conservatives from the day he was inaugurated with a speech warning of “American carnage.”
He has followed the promise of his speech with policies that have rallied the right wing to his side: remaking the American judiciary and particularly the Supreme Court, rolling back environmental regulations, cutting taxes and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
Even if he wanted to engage voters beyond his most loyal supporters, he may find he has little latitude to maneuver after defining himself so vividly in public life, particularly in these past months.
Trump and his advisers have disputed polls showing him struggling and signaled that in the months ahead they would seek to strip away some of Biden’s support with attacks on, among other things, his age and mental acuity. That could also raise doubts about the former vice president among the remaining undecided voters.
And for all their concerns about Trump’s response to the pandemic and to the demonstrations, these swing voters approve his handling of the economy, suggesting an avenue to victory for Trump in the fall should economic conditions begin to rebound.
“If I had to vote based on the economy — right now — I’m sorry, but it would be Trump,” said Cheryl VanValkenburg, a factory worker who lives in Watertown, Wisconsin, a Republican suburb. She said she voted for Trump in 2016.
Christina Stoutenburg-Sanchez, 30, who lives in Smiths Creek, Michigan, about an hour north of Detroit, said she was unhappy with both Trump and Biden. She said she was leaning toward voting for Biden. “But as much as I don’t like Trump, if he rallied and really pulled it together for our country, I could be persuaded,” she said.
Dan Hazelwood, a Republican strategist, said Trump had been hurt by his unsteady response to the coronavirus pandemic and to the nationwide demonstrations protesting police brutality and systemic racism. But he believes Trump could still assemble a bloc of voters who would support him over Biden.
“Right now, Trump’s coalition needs motivation,” he said. “The economy and the pandemic have sucked the enthusiasm away. At least 50% of America has deep and serious policy concerns with Biden and the Democrats. A ‘choice’ election between two policy directions is the motivation that Trump’s coalition needs, and it is why Biden is trying to be vanilla.”
Swing voters have been the subject of varying interest by presidential campaigns for nearly half a century. As the nation grew increasingly polarized, their numbers diminished, and some analysts began to suggest that the era of the swing voter had passed, particularly as Trump appeared to ignore them.
But his difficulties now leave little doubt that there are indeed still many voters up for grabs and that the entire nation is not locked in red or blue corners. Trump won Wisconsin narrowly in 2016 but now trails Biden there by 11 points, according to the Times poll. Overall, analysts estimate swing voters make up between 10% to 15% of the electorate nationally.
“If you want to win, you have to get a significant percentage of the swing voters,” said William G. Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeastern University who has written extensively about swing voters. “I know Republicans who think that Trump is somehow incredibly savvy politically and knows just what he’s doing. I strongly disagree. I think he’s needlessly alienating a whole lot of people who might otherwise be inclined to vote for him.”
The Times poll found that undecided voters do not trust Trump to provide accurate information about the pandemic and think he uses the presidential podium to promote falsehoods.
And in a finding that pollsters tend to watch closely (sometimes wisely, but sometimes not) for an indication of where a still far-off election might go, they believe the country is heading in the wrong direction.
As Trump has hewed to the right, Biden has shifted left, embracing, for example, the bankruptcy bill supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who he defeated in the primary, and student loan forgiveness. But those positions, which once might have been ideological outliers, do not necessarily put Biden out of step with public opinion.
“I think Biden is much closer to where the country is, even though he’s moved to the left, than Trump is,” said Matthew J. Dowd, who was the chief strategist for the 2004 reelection campaign of Bush but has since left the party.
“The country has moved to the left on guns; the country has moved to the left on race,” he said. “The country has more people of color.”
Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who has long studied swing voters, said Trump’s options were limited as he seeks a second term because the Republican base was shrinking, marking the end of the dominance of the Tea Party.
“Essentially you’ve had a Tea Party revolt stopping the great majority of the country from governing for a decade,” he said.
“I think we are playing out the last battle,” he said. “I think this is ending a period in which the country has been gridlocked by Republican dominance.”
And even if Trump wanted to appeal to more swing voters, it can be complicated for a candidate to shift in such a polarized environment, where their every statement is under such scrutiny and voters can be dogmatic and unforgiving. “It’s much harder to do than it used to be,” said Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden. “The polarization within parties. People won’t let you do it.”
Hazelwood said that even if was smart politically to try to appeal to the center in the final months of a general-election campaign, it may no longer be possible to do so.
“It’s hard to be in the middle,” he said. “If you try to take a middle ground with a group of people, you’re going to get attacked from both sides. So there’s no incentive to stand in the center and be a reasonable person. Your own side abandons you, and the other side attacks you.”

Almost anyone who works in The Washington Post newsroom can look inside its publishing system, Methode, to see what stories are coming. And at the height of the furor over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court in 2018, some who did saw a shocking article awaiting publication.
In the article, Bob Woodward, The Post legend who protected the identity of his Watergate source, Deep Throat, for 30 years, was going to unmask one of his own confidential sources. He was, in particular, going to disclose that Kavanaugh had been an anonymous source in his 1999 book “Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate.”
Woodward was planning to expose Kavanaugh because the judge had publicly denied — in a huffy letter in 1999 to The Post — an account about Kenneth Starr’s investigation of President Bill Clinton that he had himself, confidentially, provided to Woodward for his book. (Kavanaugh served as a lawyer on Starr’s team.)
The article, described by two Post journalists who read it, would have been explosive, arriving as the nominee battled a decades-old sexual assault allegation and was fighting to prove his integrity.
The article was nearly ready when the executive editor, Martin Baron, stepped in. Baron urged Woodward not to breach his arrangement with Kavanaugh and to protect his old source’s anonymity, three Post employees said. (The three, as well as other Post journalists who spoke to me, insisted on anonymity because The Post prefers that its employees not talk to the media.)
Baron and other editors convinced Woodward that it would be bad for The Post and “bad for Bob” to disclose a source, one of the journalists told me. The piece never ran.
And the steadfast adherence to the long-standing rules of newspaper journalism and the defense of the institution, which have defined Baron’s tenure at The Post, prevailed.
Happy newsrooms are all alike but every unhappy newsroom is unhappy in its own way. And in this moment of cultural reckoning, most American newsrooms are unhappy places. They’re reeling from the coronavirus pandemic and under attack from the president of the United States even as they reckon with America’s racial inequalities in their own institutions. At The Post, Black staff members’ discontent burst onto Twitter, as a set of high-profile journalists who have left the paper discussed how they felt pushed aside or pushed out. Their complaints, along with previously untold stories recently shared with me, paint a picture of an essential American institution caught in fierce cultural crosscurrents.
The revival of The Post by Baron and its owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is perhaps the greatest news business success story of the past decade. But that journalistic revival has in some ways masked a messier story, one of many contradictions.
The Post has published some of the best reporting in the 20th century American newspaper tradition that’s ever been done like the sprawling exposé of America’s war in Afghanistan — all wrapped in a digital marketing, advertising and publishing machine that The Post licenses lucratively to news organizations around the world. It’s a faceless institution in an era of influencers and personal brands. It’s a place where one of the managing editors, Tracy Grant, still hands new reporters a copy of Katharine Graham’s 1997 memoir, though, of course, The Post is no longer owned by the beloved Graham family, but by the world’s richest man. Baron’s fearless focus on White House coverage and investigations has put it at the center of the American media’s response to President Donald Trump.
But it’s also a top-down institution whose constrained view of what journalism is today has frustrated some of the industry’s creative young stars.
At the heart of The Post’s identity is Baron, 65, the ultimate old school editor. He rose through the ranks of The Miami Herald and The Los Angeles Times, then arrived at The New York Times in 1996, where he took over the powerful role of night editor, the stern gatekeeper and final approver of any article headed into the print newspaper.
But he frustrated reporters with his punctiliousness, and didn’t play the internal politics of succession. He left The Times in 2000 to take over The Miami Herald, leading its staff to a Pulitzer Prize, and then The Boston Globe, where he published a historic investigation of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. That showdown became the movie “Spotlight,” in which Liev Schreiber played Baron as introverted, irascible, and unbending — a depiction that Post employees describe as uncannily accurate.
He arrived at The Post in 2013 “stubbornly retro,” according to a National Journal profile, but when Bezos bought the paper later that year, Baron proved the perfect ballast: He wasn’t personally a man of the internet, but he made clear he was all for it. And his journalistic gravitas gave the newsroom comfort during its frantic, overdue shift to the digital age. When other publications seemed unnerved by the election of Trump, Baron’s assertion, “We’re not at war with the administration, we’re at work,” seemed to fortify journalists everywhere.
Baron’s opposition to Woodward’s story, people who work with him said, wasn’t about favoring Kavanaugh, or being afraid of a fight. Publishing the article would simply violate the traditional principle that sources should be protected. And it would veer into an uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing new form of journalism, and, in Baron’s view, imperil the reputation of the institution.
When I asked, repeatedly, for an interview with Baron, The Post’s spokeswoman, Kris Coratti, instead sent me 4,000 words of excerpts from his many speeches about journalism. The speeches reflected his sophisticated articulation of the importance of open-minded, rigorous and brave journalism. But the speech excerpts didn’t include the credo that stuck with me from a recent memo written by Baron.
“The Post is more than a collection of individuals who wish to express themselves,” Baron wrote. “The reputation of The Post must prevail over any one individual’s desire for expression.”
This principle reflects Baron’s frequently expressed frustration that his reporters’ tweets could undermine The Post’s journalism. It sometimes seems that Baron is standing athwart Twitter yelling, “Stop!” and nobody’s listening.
The intensity of the debate inside The Post over its journalists’ tweets emerged in an internal survey of reporters’ attitudes, commissioned by the national editor, Steven Ginsberg, without Baron’s participation. The report, which was circulated in April, described Post management as “ill-equipped to deal with social media in the modern era” and suggested that managers are more forgiving of mistakes “by white men and newsroom stars than they are of women, minorities and less high-profile reporters.” The Post survey presaged the more intense concerns expressed this month by current and former Black journalists about the news industry, in general, and The Post, in particular. Such concerns are not new.
But many Posties (which is how some on the staff refer to themselves) date the current gap between Black staff members and leaders of The Post — Baron and his three managing editors, Cameron Barr, Grant and Emilio Garcia-Ruiz — to the departure in 2015 of Kevin Merida, then The Post’s managing editor, to lead the ESPN sports and culture site The Undefeated. A handful of Black journalists followed him.
The union that represents newsroom employees, The Washington Post Guild, now says it has assembled 32 pages of concerns from current and former employees of color. Black staff members active with the union are pushing for a Twitter campaign to highlight the issues, modeled after a similar recent demonstration at The Los Angeles Times. But such a step would be more provocative at The Post, given the paper’s institutional unease about expressing opinions on Twitter.
Some have already surfaced. Kimbriell Kelly, who left The Post last year for The Los Angeles Times after being passed over for an editing job, tweeted that she was the “only black investigative reporter on WaPo’s Investigative Unit for most of my 7 years there.”
“The notion that only you had to prove yourself as an editor, while sooo many others who didn’t look like you, never did, steamed many of us,” replied Dana Priest, a white veteran national security reporter.
Questions have also arisen within The Post’s video operation which, like other areas outside Baron’s core obsessions, has suffered from a lack of clear strategy. Employees said in a meeting this month that personal favoritism had substituted for clear goals, according to detailed notes of the meeting by a participant. One employee said Black video editors felt they had to ask permission to get up even to go to the bathroom, when white producers didn’t. Two Black editors, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said they’d felt that difference in treatment.
“Staff are always free to take breaks,” Coratti said. “They are just asked to give others a heads-up that they will be away to ensure that the video hub is not unoccupied in the event of unanticipated news developments.”
A particularly striking issue arose from the coverage of the 2018 killing of a Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, by Saudi agents. Karen Attiah, Khashoggi’s editor, rallied support for him on Twitter, on television and on The Post’s op-ed pages. But when it came time to apply for a Pulitzer Prize — an unscientific process that often serves as an X-ray of newsroom politics and power — Attiah’s work wasn’t among the 20 pieces submitted. The exclusion, she told me, “stung,” and surprised people who had been following The Post’s work closely.
“I was appalled,” said Mohamed Soltan, a former Egyptian political prisoner and friend of Khashoggi, who described Attiah as one of the key journalists on the story.
The Post’s editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, defended the decision in an email to me: “What you have to leave out in such situations, in this case including excellent work by Jackson Diehl, Karen Attiah and several others, is never easy.”
One thing that is clear is that The Post — which prides itself on providing not just jobs for its staff but long enriching careers — has lost some people any newsroom would want to keep, including Kelly and Wesley Lowery, who left to become a correspondent for a new “60 Minutes” project on the streaming service Quibi. Another is Soraya Nadia McDonald, who said she had hoped to stretch beyond blogging twice a day on pop culture, which she did at The Post, and wanted “permission and support to be ambitious.” She followed Merida to The Undefeated, where she was a Pulitzer finalist this year for “essays on theater and film that bring a fresh, delightful intelligence to the intersections of race and art.”
“I don’t think any of that would have been published there,” she said of The Post. “This place just seems to run off its best people.”
The last time Baron faced sustained complaints from his Black staff was in 2016, after Merida left. Then, a group of Black Posties sent Baron a memo making the case for a new deputy managing editor for diversity. Baron responded that The Post was relatively diverse compared with other newsrooms and that Grant had diversity issues in hand. “They represent the bulk of her work and the most rewarding aspects of her job.’' Baron wrote in the memo. “I can’t imagine taking them away from her.”
This time, as The Post rushed to quell the kind of staff uprising that broke out at The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, that role suddenly held appeal to Baron. The Post announced June 18 that it would hire for the role, and an internal email says the deadline for applying is July 3. Baron would vet applications himself, and he reached out to Shani O. Hilton, my former colleague who is now a deputy managing editor at The Los Angeles Times overseeing its Washington bureau, its national coverage and its foreign desk, suggesting she apply.
“You may have seen the announcement of our new initiatives focused on race, ethnicity and identity,” Baron wrote to Hilton.
Hilton was not interested.
"I have seen over the years that diversity roles, particularly for black women, are the fastest way to be sidelined out of the most important conversations about coverage and hiring,” she wrote back. “The moniker lets other managers think the work of improving representation and newsroom culture doesn’t fall on them."
Barr, one of the managing editors, said the job would, in fact, focus on coverage, even if it might not involve directly managing reporters. “This is a job that brings together the journalism and the leadership of the room,” he said.
That new editor will face questions about identity and journalism that extend beyond race. Two Post employees said editors had barred a Post reporter who publicly accused another journalist of sexual assault, Felicia Sonmez, from writing about the subject, citing the appearance of conflict of interest in her public comments. But it’s hard to imagine reporters are expected to be neutral on the issue of sexual assault — and the decision seems almost a caricature of the old idea that only people imagined to have no stake in an issue, often white men, can cover it.
It can, in this fraught moment, be difficult to untangle the forces driving the arguments about newsroom culture, objectivity and fairness. There are, no doubt, real disagreements around the issue of how much journalists’ opinions, identities and experiences should shape coverage and be shared with their audience, and when “objectivity” simply means a dominant point of view.
But one clear strain in the tensions at The Post is simply, and sometimes hilariously, generational. In the happier times of early January 2020, writer Maura Judkis blew up the internet with the article, “People are seeing ‘Cats’ while high out of their minds.” It featured irresistible testimonials from people who described watching the film of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical while on marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms or other substances, such as: “The most terrifying experience of my life. I swear to God my soul escaped me.”
Baron, who had not seen the piece before it was published, erupted, two Post employees said, furious that the story was “glorifying recreational drug use,” one of them said.
Coratti said that Baron was not “upset” but did “advise that we should be careful not to be seen as celebrating or championing recreational use of drugs.” So the dispute seems to be less about journalistic principle than about whether you like edibles.
Even those who are frustrated by Baron’s strong-willed style of management speak with reverence of his obsessive commitment to reporting. Still, some of The Post’s challenges will probably be left to his successor. Baron has told colleagues he will be around through next year’s presidential inauguration, but perhaps not much longer. “Marty will give us a great deal of notice before he retires, and that notice has not been given,” Coratti said.
But what separates today’s cultural conflicts inside newsrooms from previous generations’ is that they now play out, in real time, in public on social media. And they offer a window into an industry, and society, struggling to find its moral footing around issues of racism.
That seemed a painful takeaway from the recent Post article about a white woman who came as Megyn Kelly-in-blackface to a Halloween party at the home of a Washington Post cartoonist in 2018. The woman lost her job when she told her employer about the coming article, which readers reacted to with outrage and questions about its news value.
“Was this story intended to be a spoof of our culture?” Patrick Gaspard, who served as ambassador to South Africa during the Obama administration and is now the president of the grant-making Open Society Foundations, asked on Twitter. “Did they really invest all this Investigatory resource on this piece to shame this average person who holds no discernible power?”
The story’s handling inside The Post underscores some of the paper’s underlying tensions.
After a guest at the party who believed the woman was a Post employee complained to the paper, editors assigned it to two trusted veterans: Sydney Trent, an experienced former editor, and Marc Fisher, a reporter whom The Post also turned to when someone had to write about Bezos’ explicit text messages. Fisher, who is white, reportedly told people he had doubts about the news value of the costume party story, though he led the reporting and writing. Trent, who is Black, saw it as worth doing, three Post journalists said.
White senior editors, including Baron and Barr, signed off on the story and sided with Trent on some questions of tone. That played to old reflexes and new ones: They chose to address a complex moment with the most traditional reportorial form, and they trusted the judgment of a Black reporter with a long history of writing and reporting about race. And while many Posties were conspicuously silent about the story on social media, Trent stood by it, and posted it to her Facebook page to a positive reception.
But Black reporters are, of course, not monolithic, and many reporters of all backgrounds at The Post found the 3,000-word investigation puzzling. A random person “dressing like a famous lady in blackface at a party 2 years ago seems the least of our concerns right now,” Attiah tweeted.

NEW YORK — It started Tuesday night when about 100 protesters began occupying City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan — with some spending the night — in an effort to draw more focus to their demand for deep budget cuts to the Police Department.
In a matter of days, a movement took root. What started on a patch of lawn and a few square feet has now taken over most of the park and drawn extensive attention across social media, with “Occupy City Hall” as the group’s rallying cry. Volunteers have flocked to the park, dropping off food, coffee and supplies to build a kind of campground.
So far, the police have not broken up the gathering, which has taken some inspiration from the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations of 2011 at Zuccotti Park in the financial district in Lower Manhattan. But some disagreements have resulted between protesters and the police over the use of umbrellas, tents and bicycles.
The City Hall encampment, which was initially spearheaded by Vocal-NY, a grassroots organization, is the latest addition to the wave of protests in New York after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police in late May.
Jawanza James Williams, director of organizing for Vocal-NY, conceptualized the occupation as a way to pressure the city into reducing its police budget by at least $1 billion, a sum the group has asked to be shifted to other resources, including education and social services.
The protesters, who are part of a movement to defund the police, are focusing on Wednesday’s deadline for the city’s budget.
Corey Johnson, speaker of the City Council, which must approve the budget, has called for a $1 billion reduction in the $6 billion that the city spends on the Police Department, but Mayor Bill de Blasio has not endorsed such a cut.
“We can’t leave anything to chance,” said Williams, who refers to “Occupy City Hall” as “a people’s bazaar for liberation.”
In a short time, organizers, largely Black and queer, have transformed the plaza. Hand-drawn art covers any semblance of government infrastructure: subway entrances, metal barricades and kiosks — a sharp contrast to the limestone municipal building across the street.
A sophisticated network was created to make the space habitable. Organizers built a library, community garden and even a hut for tea lovers. They gathered donations of prepared meals, water, hand sanitizer, blankets, vitamins and cigarettes. And they formed elaborate teams for safety, sanitation and food distribution.
Orange armbands distinguish the de-escalation team from the medics, who wear a red cross emblem made from electric tape. By Saturday, organizers had installed internet service and set up a laundry schedule.
As the movement expands, tensions over strategy have emerged, especially over whether Vocal-NY is demanding deep enough cuts in the budget.
Some supporters of the movement to defund the police have expressed discomfort over the number of young, white people who are taking part in the gathering, as well as over an atmosphere that is occasionally upbeat.
Organizers responded that the movement’s ability to accommodate a diverse range of opinion was a sign of success.
The threat of the coronavirus also looms over the gathering. During peak hours, it’s impossible for protesters to socially distance. Thousands are elbow-to-elbow at the plaza even as the occupation sprawls farther south. At night, protesters still cluster at the lawn, sleeping with masks on. Others unroll their sleeping bags and tarps farther out when it’s time to call it a night.
The encampment is run by a combination of veteran organizers and first-time volunteers.
Sierra Nicole, 23, from West Harlem, didn’t think she would end up overseeing the welcome desk when she first arrived Thursday afternoon. On that first day, Nicole had gone straight to that desk to get more information, but when she noticed a volunteer who appeared tired, she offered to take his place. He agreed.
A few hours later, a protester walked up to Nicole eager to volunteer. The next available slot was in eight hours, at 3 a.m., but the protester, a woman, didn’t seem to mind. Nicole signed her up.
Many volunteers work around the clock. At 4 a.m. Friday, Gregory Lecrocq, 31, from the Upper East Side, began his shift at the food station, making breakfast sandwiches for early risers. Since volunteering, he sleeps from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. By 4 p.m., he’s usually back at the protest.
Occupy has also become a meeting point for other marches. Protesters from Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn have stopped by to show their support as well as to pick up food and water.
Some protesters have said they plan to remain at the plaza beyond the budget deadline day, until their demands for systemic change are met. Williams said he’s not opposed to people staying longer.
Either way, Vocal-NY members said they were optimistic that they had organized a movement that could sustain itself in the long-term, said Jasmine Budnella, 34, the group’s drug policy coordinator.
Still, as the week has progressed, organizers said they had grappled with setting the right tone. While showing joy is an important form of resistance, Williams said, the group doesn’t want people to forget why they’ve gathered. At times, the occupation can appear festival-like. But those moments are often followed by a speaker stressing the need to stay alert and vigilant.
“We’re here because Black people are dying in the street,” one speaker told the crowd Thursday night. “We’re not here to socialize, we’re here for real-life problems.”
Many protesters said they had committed to sleeping outside every night until the end of the month, noting that they have everything they need to survive: food, water, clothes, a place to shower and restrooms.
Others said they would try to show up every other night. Those who didn’t want to sleep outside said they would volunteer from sunrise to sundown.
Organizers said the movement’s ethos is centered around anti-consumerism, inclusivity and camaraderie. Everything is free-of-charge, and protesters are constantly on the lookout for one another. Making the encampment a safe space for vulnerable communities has also been a top priority, they said.
On Thursday evening, Moji Armu and her two children — ages 6 and 9 — stumbled upon the demonstration on their way home.
Armu said she had thought about bringing her children to protests in the past but that they had become frightened to do so after seeing images on television of protesters clashing with the police. But on Thursday, her children noticed an art-making station at the Occupy gathering and ran to the tray of paint tubes.
A little later, she said her 6-year-old son paused in bewilderment. He didn’t realize that what he had been witnessing — the art making, dancing — could be considered protesting.
He asked his mother if he had just attended his first protest. She smiled and said, “You sure did.”

Trump Retweets Racist Video Showing Supporter Yelling ‘White Power’ [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Sunday retweeted a video of one of his supporters yelling “White power!,” once again using the vast reach of his social media platforms to inflame racial divisions in a nation roiled by weeks of protests about police brutality against Black people and demands for social justice reforms.
The edited racist video shows a white man riding in a golf cart bearing “Trump 2020” and “America First” signs during what appears to be an angry clash over the president and race between elderly white residents of a Florida retirement community. Trump deleted the tweet more than three hours after posting it.
In response to a protester shouting “Where’s your white hood?” and other taunts, the man in the golf cart pumps his fist in the air twice and says “White power!” twice. The two-minute video continues to show profane exchanges between protesters and other Trump supporters riding on more golf carts.
The president retweeted the video to his millions of followers just after 7:30 Sunday morning, thanking “the great people of The Villages,” the Florida retirement community where the clash apparently took place. He added: “The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall. Corrupt Joe is shot. See you soon!!!”
The tweet was widely criticized as racist and insensitive, and again demonstrated the president’s willingness to use social media to amplify some of the most hateful commentary of some of his followers, even at a moment of national unrest.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican senator, called the video “offensive” and asked Trump to take it off his Twitter page.
“There is no question he should not have retweeted it, and he should just take it down,” Scott said on the CNN program “State of the Union.” “We can play politics with it or we can’t. I’m not going to. I think it’s indefensible. We should take it down.”
Trump deleted it less than an hour after Scott’s comments, but he did not condemn the “white power” statement or specifically disavow the sentiment expressed by his supporter.
Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said Trump “is a big fan of The Villages.”
“He did not hear the one statement made on the video,” Deere said. “What he did see was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters.”
John Bolton, the president’s former national security adviser who just released a scathing book about Trump, said Sunday that the president’s inattention to detail made it possible that he did not notice the racist comments.
“He doesn’t pay attention to a lot of things,” Bolton said on “State of the Union.” “It’s entirely possible that he tweeted this video because he saw the sign, I think it was in the first go-kart that said the Trump 2020 or something like that. That’s all he needed to see. Not paying attention. Not considering all the implications of information he gets.”
But Bolton added, “It may be that you can draw a conclusion that he heard it and it was racist and he tweeted it to promote the message. It’s a legitimate conclusion to draw.”
Either way, the president’s initial decision to approvingly share the blatant display of support for white supremacy was the latest example of his willingness to use his vast Twitter following to inject incendiary commentary into the ongoing debate in the country over systemic racism.
In May, as protests erupted after the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer, Trump tweeted, “When the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a phrase with a long history of connection to racism.
More recently, Trump has used his Twitter feed to attack protesters who have pulled down statues of Confederate generals, calling them “arsonists, anarchists, looters, and agitators.” On Saturday night, he tweeted out 15 “wanted” posters for people the U.S. Park Police were seeking in connection with vandalism in Lafayette Square, just outside the White House.
The video on Sunday — which could not be independently verified by The New York Times — appeared to show a slow-moving parade through the Florida community with supporters of Trump riding golf carts, wearing red, white and blue, and displaying pro-Trump materials.
Protesters lined the street, many of them screaming epithets, accusing the Trump supporters of being racists and holding signs calling the president a bigot.
In his tweet, Trump did not specifically refer to the man who yelled “white power.” But his reference to “the great people of The Villages” was an eerie echo of his comments in the summer of 2017, when he responded to deadly violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, by saying there were “very fine people on both sides.”
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, invoked the president’s comments about Charlottesville in response to the video Sunday.
“We’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the President has picked a side,” Biden tweeted.
Trump has repeatedly denied that he was expressing support for white supremacy with his “both sides” comment. But the tweet Sunday underscores what has become a hallmark of his presidency since he took office: a willingness to embrace divisive comments when they are coming from people he perceives to be his supporters.
The president has routinely retweeted far-right messages and a conspiracy theory known as QAnon, which includes people who believe that a “deep state” in the government is filled with satanic pedophiles. Trump once retweeted VB Nationalist, an anonymous account that has promoted a hoax about top Democrats worshipping the devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.
“I’ve been retweeted by the President of the United States, President Trump!” the author of the anonymous account tweeted at the time.
An analysis of Trump’s Twitter account by The New York Times at the end of last year found that the president had retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that had pushed conspiracy, racist or other fringe content, including more than two dozen that were later suspended by Twitter.
Recently, Twitter has begun to crack down directly on Trump’s feed, posting warnings on some of his messages. In May, when the president tweeted about shooting after looting, the company added a statement to the post.
“This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible,” the company wrote. Later, when the president warned that efforts by protesters to set up an “autonomous zone” in Washington, D.C., would be “met with serious force!,” Twitter put up a similar message and blocked it from being retweeted.
The quick deletion of the video Sunday was a rare instance in which Trump backed down in the face of criticism. His previous tweets have remained online despite the company’s online warnings.

TAIPEI, Taiwan — With the coronavirus pandemic making large gatherings impossible in many places, the biggest Pride events around the globe were mostly forced to scale back or move online.
But a march that drew hundreds of people in Taiwan on Sunday became both a celebration of diversity and a testament to the self-governing island’s ability to contain the coronavirus.
A giant rainbow flag led a procession across Liberty Square, a large plaza in central Taipei, in an event that Darien Chen, one of the organizers, said he hoped would bring comfort to the millions of people around the world who could not attend a big gathering because of the pandemic.
Few participants wore masks, as Taiwan has only five known coronavirus cases, all of them in quarantine. Taiwan, which has a population of 23 million, has recorded only 446 infections and seven deaths since its first case was reported in January.
After traveling across the square, marchers posed with a rainbow flag in front of a memorial to Chiang Kai-shek, the authoritarian ruler who brought martial law to Taiwan after fleeing Mao Zedong’s communist revolution in China in 1949. Chen screamed expletives at Chiang’s statue until going hoarse, as a small number of police officers watched.
Under martial law, which ended in 1987, homosexuality was a criminal offense. But Taiwan has since become a leader of gay rights in a region where such rights have lagged, and last year its government became the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.
“Countries without same-sex marriage need to maintain the struggle — their day will eventually come” said Chi Chia-wei, who was arrested in 1986 for coming out as gay. “Here in Asia we’re still waiting for the second country.”
The parade was planned on short notice as organizers realized that there might be no major offline events for the 50th anniversary of the first Gay Pride march, in New York City, held a year to the day after the Stonewall Riots began there. The riots and the march were turning points in the push for LGBT rights.
Taipei Pride — which is usually held in late October, when the chance of storms or typhoons is much lower — is East Asia’s largest Pride event. It regularly draws LGBT people from countries where discrimination and unequal treatment are far more entrenched.
Sarah Ondrus, a longtime Taipei resident originally from Oregon, said that while she normally attended Taipei Pride, she felt especially compelled to march on the anniversary of Stonewall.
“We’re marching for those who can’t,” she said.
The parade was Taipei resident Arlene Chen’s first time participating in a Pride event.
“I want Taiwan to embrace differences between people,” Chen said. “And I want the world to see Taiwan.”
The march Sunday held new meaning for Chloé Grolleau, a French citizen who said it was her first Pride event identifying as queer. Grolleau carried a fan emblazoned with the message “Black trans lives matter.”
“It’s important to use this event to bring visibility to Black Lives Matter, and Black trans lives,” she said. “They’re the most marginalized people in the world.”
The struggle for recognition is not unfamiliar to the people of Taiwan. The Chinese government claims the self-governing island as its territory, despite having never ruled it, and has used its growing global influence to isolate and erase Taiwan on the international stage.
The pandemic, however, has increased Taiwan’s visibility. Sports fans starved for live competition in the lockdown era have sent online viewership of Taiwan’s professional baseball league soaring. Taiwan has also donated millions of masks to countries around the world, including the United States.
“Taiwanese people understand what it’s like to be marginalized, so we are able to be a very cooperative and compassionate community,” Chen said. “Whether it’s standing up against China alone for years or our success during the current pandemic, Taiwan has been doing our best to be a global citizen and show that Taiwan can help.”

NEW YORK — When someone in the grip of a mental health emergency behaves erratically in New York City, it is the Police Department that is often called in. When there are serious disciplinary problems in the schools, or when homeless people are found sleeping in the subways, police officers are asked to take over.
The Police Department’s purview is so vast that elite officers trained for hostage situations sometimes find themselves assigned to animal control duties, chasing a runaway deer through the Bronx or corralling an escaped boa constrictor, as they did recently at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.
For decades, a succession of city governments have turned to the department as a catchall fix for many of society’s ills, outside of traditional crime-fighting. That has meant deploying a force of 36,000 officers with a paramilitary approach that at times can be unnecessarily confrontational.
Now, after weeks of protests against police brutality spurred by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a political movement has gathered momentum to curtail the New York Police Department’s size and mission creep.
Calls to “defund the police” have resonated with the City Council, where the speaker has proposed cutting $1 billion from the department’s $6 billion budget and reducing the uniformed force. Protesters and others have demanded that cuts go further and have put up an encampment in City Hall Park.
These tensions are now coming to a head in budget negotiations between the council and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has not expressed support for deep cuts in the police budget. The budget deadline is July 1.
The police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, has said that he supports shifting some funding from his department to youth programs and that he is open to giving up ancillary functions the police have absorbed, like school safety and traffic enforcement.
But he has contended that drastic cuts to the number of uniformed officers are unwise given a recent rise in violent crime and will deprive high-crime areas of vital policing services.
“The people you’re trying to help the most, potentially I believe, you are going to hurt the most,” Shea said in an interview with PIX11.
Demands to shrink the footprint of the Police Department — together with other requests, like to increase transparency in the disciplinary process — are coming from many quarters.
Hundreds of educators signed an open letter to Richard A. Carranza, the chancellor of the city’s Department of Education, demanding that school safety officers, who are unarmed, be removed from buildings.
Black and Latino students still represent roughly 90% of arrests and summonses in city schools, although overall numbers of arrests have declined sharply under de Blasio.
And as police shootings have continued, a coalition of 80 mental health organizations has declared that a multimillion-dollar training initiative had failed. The program has so far given half the officers on the force 40 hours of training in handling encounters with people suffering mental health emergencies.
Since the program was implemented in 2015, 16 people with mental illness have been killed in encounters with New York City police, a higher rate than before the training started, said Carla Rabinowitz from Community Access, an advocacy group that has worked with the Police Department to expand mental health training for officers.
Just last week, a man with a history of mental illness was killed in Queens when police officers shocked him repeatedly with Tasers.
“Forty hours of training can’t counter the police mentality; it can’t counter the police values,” Rabinowitz said. “When someone calls for help, they need help. They don’t need someone with a gun pointed at them.”
All but one of those 16 people with mental illness killed by the police were people of color, Rabinowitz added.
And in the subway, heavy-handed arrests of turnstile jumpers and officers’ efforts to clear sleeping homeless people from train cars — both of which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic people — have long been criticized by advocacy groups.
No police department should be invested with all these responsibilities, said Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate. Too often, he said, a law enforcement approach exacerbates a problem, particularly in Black and Hispanic communities that receive outsize attention from the police.
“The only tools they have are handcuffs, a gun, a baton and a summons book,” Williams said in an interview. “That’s always going to be a disaster when you have disparate policing depending on the community you’re in.”
A catchall solution
At a recent news conference, Patrick Lynch, president of the police officers’ union, said it was the failures of other city agencies that forced the department to take on many additional duties.
“If they want to shift responsibilities reasonably, do it,” Lynch said. “But where are you going to put it? Who’s going to do it? When you fail, who are you going to ask to step up? I got the answer. They’re going to come back and give it to the PD.”
Even critics of the department acknowledge that there is some truth in his assessment.
In the late 1990s, amid concern over the Education Department’s vetting of its school safety force, the police were called in to take over security in the schools.
As mental health institutions closed down or were deprived of funding through the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, the department was called on to respond to emergencies and engage with the flood of homeless people on the streets and in the subway.
In the city’s darkest days — during the crack epidemic and the period of runaway crime in the 1980s and early ’90s, and after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — police officers were looked upon more favorably in many quarters.
The Police Department of today is the result of the expansion to meet the challenges of those eras. The city now has fewer than 400 homicides each year, although the size of the uniformed staff has changed little from the early 1990s, when there were more than 2,000 murders annually.
While few would argue that the terrorist threat has gone away completely, some elected officials and civil rights lawyers have questioned the need for the department’s vast and secretive intelligence-gathering apparatus. The Police Department, for instance, has several liaison officers stationed abroad.
Even some defenders of the police acknowledge that civilian agencies were better suited to dealing with the mentally ill, the homeless and public health crises.
“Could some other agencies do that better?” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy nonprofit. “I think the answer is, in some cases, absolutely.”
‘Structural, systemic and transformational change’
For decades, city leaders of all political persuasions, fearful of being blamed for a rise in crime, have been loath to pare back the Police Department, even as crime has fallen. Its budget has grown from $3 billion in 2000 to $5.7 billion today.
De Blasio, for instance, came to office in 2014 promising to overhaul the department and to end the practice of searching large numbers of young people in high-crime neighborhoods for weapons and drugs, which a judge found unconstitutional.
But the department grew under his tenure. When the coronavirus pandemic cratered the city’s economy, it was education and youth programs that de Blasio cut when he released his proposed budget in April. He left the Police Department virtually untouched.
The mayor has shifted his stance in the face of recent protests, pledging some cuts that will free up money that can then be diverted to social programs, particularly in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. But he has not said how far he is willing to go.
The City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, and his allies said the time had come to sharply shrink the department’s sphere of responsibility.
Uniformed officers should not police schoolyards or provide security at homeless shelters, Johnson said in an interview. Nor, he said, should the department continue to rack up $700 million in overtime payments, as it did last year.
Johnson has proposed shrinking the department by 2,000 uniformed officers.
“This is a moment of reckoning,” he said. “It is a moment of structural, systemic and transformational change, and that means redesigning what public safety looks like and it means not relying only on the NYPD.”
Police officials say that most of the budget goes to salary and overtime for people on patrol, and that there is no way to cut $1 billion without deep layoffs, which they say would drive up response times in a period when crime is ticking upward.
Even some supporters of reining in the police have cautioned against going too far.
Councilman I. Daneek Miller, D-Queens, who is a co-chair of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, said that he supported the council’s proposal to cut $1 billion from the police budget, but that it should not come at the expense of progress in relations between his district and the police.
“It would be irresponsible for me to dismiss all of the work the community had done with those precincts to get us to this point,” he said in an interview. “We’re not where we want to be, but we’re damn sure better than we were.”
The Police Department acts on its own
In the past, restrictions on the Police Department’s authority have often come as a result of outside intervention, and often in the face of opposition from city leaders. Court orders, for instance, forced the city to drop its policy of “stop and frisk” and to limit its intelligence gathering in mostly Muslim neighborhoods.
Still, there are indications that the political climate may change the department’s reluctance to back off aggressive enforcement strategies that its leaders have stuck with for decades, as crime has steadily dropped to levels not seen since the 1950s.
This month, Shea, the police commissioner, announced that he would disband and reassign 600 officers on plainclothes “anti-crime” teams, which for nearly two decades have focused on making gun arrests and proactively preventing violent crime.
Those teams have attracted a disproportionate number of misconduct complaints and have been involved in some of the city’s most notorious police shootings.
“We welcome reform, but we also believe meaningful reform starts from within,” Shea said. “This is a policy shift coming from me, personally.”
Further changes to the department, however, will require other city agencies to begin shouldering the burden of public safety, said those who support reducing the role of the police.
Rory I. Lancman, chair of the City Council’s justice committee, said it would be easy to reduce number of officers to meet today’s demands but more difficult to teach other agencies to take over those roles and to do a better job.
“You can’t get the police out of the Department of Education without reforming how the Department of Education ensures public safety,” he said. “That’s true for homeless services, mental health services, you name it.”

Chief Beaten by Police Is Longtime Fighter for Indigenous Rights [With graphic(s)]

TORONTO — He survived Canada’s notoriously abusive schools for Indigenous children and went on to lead his own nation. He battled governments and oil giants over the pollution of his traditional territory, garnering him the praise and admiration of Desmond Tutu, Greta Thunburg and celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio.
But when police officers double-teamed Allan Adam, the outspoken leader of one of Canada’s First Nations, tackling him to the pavement and punching him over an expired license plate, he said they treated him as if he were voiceless and powerless.
“They did it to the chief. Not just any chief,” said Adam, the leader of the Dene nation of 1,200 people in northern Alberta, which famously fought for its rights in the midst of an oil boom affecting its territory. He was someone known, he said, to “not back down from a fight.”
“They shouldn’t have picked me,” Adam said in a phone interview from his home in Fort Chipewyan on remote Lake Athabasca. “They made a mistake.”
Adam was charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest. On Wednesday, the charges against him were dropped.
But videos of the police beating an unarmed man have prompted not just an investigation into the officers involved but also outrage across Canada, with growing demands for an overhaul of the country’s policing system, which imprisons Indigenous and Black people at highly disproportionate rates.
“We have to seriously open the eyes of every nonnative Canadian to the realities that we, as Indigenous people of the land, have had to live with for decades,” Adam said at a news conference last week.
Adam was the youngest of 11 children. His father was a hunter and trapper who supported the family by fishing and harvesting furs.
Just before his sixth birthday, Adam was dropped off at a brick building on the edge of town: the Holy Angels residential school. His three years there are still too painful to discuss, he said in the interview.
The schools, though mostly established by religious orders, were used by the Canadian government for more than 160 years to assimilate Indigenous children forcibly, removing them from their families and cultures.
A national Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared them tools of “cultural genocide” five years ago in a report that documented widespread physical and sexual abuse and thousands of deaths.
“When I think of residential school, I think of death, rape and physical abuse,” said Adam, who lost fluency in his native Denesuline language while at the school, where he feared being hit for speaking it. “Horrific stories I suffered at the hands of nuns and priests and schoolteachers.”
Adam said he took up drinking and smoking at age 9, after leaving. Most of his classmates from that time, he said, are dead.
Reconnecting to the land saved his life, Adam said.
When he was a child, his parents would take him out into the boreal forest for five months a year, teaching him to fish, trap and hunt. His father taught him to shoot a moose during mating season by standing still in darkness, waiting for the crashing sound of the animal’s approach.
“Until today, I still can’t master it,” he said, laughing.
“If it wasn’t for the land, I wouldn’t be here today,” said Adam, 53, now a father of five and grandfather of 12. He added, “It taught me to become a human being again.”
After seventh grade, Adam left school, he said, “when the trauma started coming back.” He worked as a firefighter and truck driver as well as for his nation’s housing authority, among other jobs. He went to prison four times for assault, he said, because he would not back down from a fight.
“I’ve been run over so many times in life, I won’t let that happen again,” he said. “What residential school did to me, I won’t let that happen to my kids.”
He found his calling once he was elected to the government of his nation, which has land in central Canada around Lake Athabasca and the Athabasca River.
Four years later, in 2007, he was elected chief on an economic development platform to exploit the nearby upriver oil sands, which had grown from a single mine in his childhood to a sprawling landscape of smokestacks and tailings ponds.
A few weeks after his election, Adam attended a town meeting where a researcher detailed his troubling findings about the local water quality: heightened levels of carcinogens and toxic substances like arsenic and mercury.
It echoed a local doctor’s warning about concerning rates of rare cancers in the town.
“I thought to myself: ‘Oh, wow. There goes the economic plan,’” Adam said.
Soon after, he and his council began their first lawsuit against the government, arguing that recently awarded oil sands leases in their area be rescinded, as they had been provided without consulting local Indigenous communities.
They lost the case, but Adam garnered a reputation as an outspoken chief who would not back down.
Over the next decade, he helped start more than a dozen legal actions, holding conferences and protests.
“He steps up when he has to,” said Melody Lepine, director of government and industry relations for the Mikisew Cree First Nation, also based around Fort Chipewyan. “He has no fear to do what’s right and be vocal.”
Adam became a favorite among people campaigning against pollution and climate change, of which Canada’s oil sands became a growing symbol.
Tzeporah Berman first met him in 2008, with Sting and Canadian actress Neve Campbell.
“What he has consistently done is bring in the most up-to-date scientific information on toxins in the air and water and human health impacts, and bring them into lawsuits that drag on for decades,” said Berman, a Canadian environmentalist who ran Greenpeace’s climate and energy campaign. “Meanwhile, development is encroaching further and further into their land.”
In 2014, Adam traveled with Neil Young on a cross-Canada tour, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for his lawsuits. Soon after, DiCaprio visited and offered to fund the community’s water monitoring program.
“He wanted me to play a part in his movie ‘The Revenant,’” Adam said. “I said: ‘No, Leo. I’m not going to do it. I’ve got an election next year.’”
“It was a good movie,” Adam added. “Long in some parts, but good.”
His activism also made him enemies.
Right-wing media and oil lobby groups labeled him a “prop.” He was regularly confronted by angry oil sands workers in Fort McMurray, his lawyer said, where Adam had bought a second home with the residential school settlement he had received from the Canadian government. There were death threats, Adam said.
In 2018, Adam was criticized for the opposite reason: signing a deal with Teck Resources to build the biggest oil sands mine to date, inside the area he had long maintained should be protected.
At the time, he said, he was both heartbroken and exhausted from fighting the system, with no tangible results. This way, at least, his people would get some benefits and a seat at the table.
Teck withdrew its application earlier this year, citing an unresolved debate in Canada over climate change and resource extraction.
“If I knew all along, all we had to do to kill these projects was to agree to them, we would have agreed a long time ago,” Adam said, laughing.
“That’s the gray area he has to dance in all the time,” said Eriel Deranger, who was Adam’s communications coordinator until 2017. “It’s a total hypocrisy that’s forced upon our nation. ”
Adam had signed agreements with mining companies before, in exchange for financial benefits and environmental guarantees. That money was put into projects like a community-owned grocery store in Fort Chipewyan but also into a long-term trust he hopes will be used to buy a new home for his nation.
“Our people will be environmental refugees,” Adam said, because the land will be polluted so badly by the oil industry. “I figure we’ve got 25 years left.”

Clifford Wagner, an 80-year-old Republican in Tucson, Arizona, never cared for President Donald Trump.
He supported Jeb Bush in the 2016 presidential primary race and cast a protest vote in the general election for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee. An Air Force veteran, Wagner described the Trump presidency as a mortifying experience: His friends in Europe and Japan tell him the United States has become “the laughingstock of the world.”
This year, Wagner said he would register his opposition to Trump more emphatically than he did in 2016. He plans to vote for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and hopes the election is a ruinous one for the Republican Party.
“I’m a Christian, and I do not believe in the hateful, racist, bigoted speech that the president uses,” Wagner said, adding, “As much as I never thought I’d say this, I hope we get a Democratic president, a Democratic-controlled Senate and maintain a Democratic-controlled House.”
Wagner is part of one of the most important maverick voting groups in the 2020 general election: conservative-leaning seniors who have soured on the Republican Party over the past four years.
Republican presidential candidates typically carry older voters by solid margins, and in his first campaign Trump bested Hillary Clinton by 7 percentage points with voters older than 65. He won white seniors by nearly triple that margin.
Today, Trump and Biden are tied among seniors, according to a poll of registered voters conducted by The New York Times and Siena College. And in the six most important battleground states, Biden has established a clear upper hand, leading Trump by 6 percentage points among the oldest voters and nearly matching the president’s support among whites in that age group.
That is no small advantage for Biden, the former vice president, given the prevalence of retirement communities in a few of those crucial states, including Arizona and Florida.
No Democrat has won or broken even with seniors in two decades, since Al Gore in 2000 devoted much of his general election campaign to warning that Republicans would cut popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. In 2016, Trump, now 74, seemed in some ways keenly attuned to the political sensitivities of voters in his own age group. As a candidate, he bluntly rejected his party’s long-standing interest in restructuring government guarantees of retirement security.
But Trump’s presidency has been a trying experience for many of these voters, some of whom are now so frustrated and disillusioned that they are preparing to take the drastic step of supporting a Democrat.
The grievances of these defecting seniors are familiar, most or all of them shared by their younger peers. But these voters often express themselves with a particularly sharp kind of dismay and disappointment. They see Trump as coarse and disrespectful, divisive to his core and failing persistently to comport himself with the dignity of the other presidents that they have observed for more than half a century. The Times poll also found that most seniors disapproved of Trump’s handling of race relations and his handling of the protests after the death of George Floyd.
And as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the country, putting older Americans at particular risk, these voters feel a special kind of frustration and betrayal with Trump’s ineffective leadership and often-blasé public comments about the crisis.
The president has urged the country to return to life-as-usual far more quickly than the top public health officials in his own administration have recommended. Some prominent Republican officials and conservative pundits have even suggested at times that older people should be willing to risk their own health for the sake of a quicker resumption of the business cycle.
In The Times poll, seniors in the battleground states disapproved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic by 7 points, 52% to 45%. By a 26-point margin, this group said the federal government should prioritize containing the pandemic over reopening the economy.
Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, a 40-year-old Republican deeply versed in the politics of the retiree-rich swing state, said many seniors were disturbed by important aspects of Trump’s record and found Biden a mild and respectable alternative who did not inspire the same antipathy on the right that Clinton did in 2016.
Biden is regarded by much of his own party as bland and conventional, and his nostalgia-cloaked candidacy may be uniquely equipped to ease a sizable group of right-of-center seniors into the Democratic column, at least for one election.
“He’s not ever been known to be a radical or an extreme leftist or liberal, so there is certainly a degree of comfort there,” Curbelo said. He added: “This public health crisis is so threatening, especially to seniors, and because the president hasn’t earned high marks in his handling of it, I think that has also been a factor in Biden’s improving numbers.”
Biden and his allies have expressed growing excitement about the political possibilities that the shifting senior vote could create in the fall. That is true not only in Sun Belt retirement havens but also in Midwestern states where Biden is currently running well ahead of Clinton’s 2016 performance with a range of conservative-leaning constituencies, including older white people.
In Iowa, former Gov. Tom Vilsack, a close Biden ally, said the former vice president had closed a substantial deficit in the state through his response to the coronavirus, his connection with older rural voters and his ability to empathize.
“Part of it is the demeanor he has projected during the course of this pandemic,” Vilsack said, before acknowledging, “As much as Joe’s doing, it’s probably as much or more what the president has done or failed to do.”
He cited an ad from a group of anti-Trump Republicans that cast Trump’s approach to crisis as erratic and selfish, unlike past presidents who have confronted national tragedies like the Challenger disaster and the Oklahoma City bombing.
“Each of those presidents was able to connect emotionally to the feelings of the nation,” Vilsack said. “This president has had a really, really hard time doing that.”
Trump’s ineffective response to the coronavirus weighed on the thinking of many older voters surveyed in the poll, including Patrick Mallon, 73, a retired information technology specialist in Battle Creek, Michigan.
Mallon said he was a registered Republican who had long been unhappy with Trump but mindful that he was presiding over a strong economy. The pandemic set Mallon firmly against Trump’s reelection.
“The main reason is Donald Trump saying, ‘Don’t wear a mask, this thing is going to go away, we can have large gatherings,’” he said. “Everything he says is incorrect and dangerous to the country.”
When young people contract the coronavirus, Mallon added, “most of them will survive, but they’re going to give it to their parents, their grandparents — and I’m sorry, we’re just as important as that younger generation is.”
The abandonment of Trump by older voters is far from universal, and he still has a strong base among older white men and self-described conservatives. Nationally, the oldest voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy by 12 points, more than double the figure for voters of all ages.
And in the battleground states, Trump has a 10-point lead over Biden with white men older than 65, even as Biden has opened up an advantage with white women in the same age group. Nonwhite seniors in the battleground states currently support Biden over Trump by a huge margin, 65% to 25%.
Even among some seniors supportive of Trump, however, there is an undercurrent of unease about the way he approaches the presidency.
Karen Gamble, 65, of Reidsville, North Carolina, said that she was dissatisfied with the overall government response to the coronavirus outbreak and echoed many popular complaints about Trump’s persona. She said she wished, for instance, that Trump “wouldn’t be such a bully and would conform to being in a regal-like position, as our presidents have always been.”
Gamble said she was planning to support Trump in the election all the same, describing Biden as too old and too compromised on matters related to China. But Gamble, who said she has a “severe lung problem,” expressed hope that Trump would change his approach to the pandemic.
“We can’t blame him for this — how many presidents could really do any better than what he’s done?” Gamble said, before adding: “I just wish he wouldn’t let the country open up as much as it has. I see all these teens and young people at the beach, and I fear for them because now they’re getting sick.”
In Tucson, Gerald Lankin, a more forceful Trump supporter, said he would back the president mainly as a vote “against the Democrats.” Lankin, 77, said he found Trump’s personal manner offensive but agreed with him on most issues and saw Democrats as “much, much, much, much too far to the left.”
“He hasn’t really done anything that I can say I’m against,” Lankin said of Trump. “I think what he’s doing is the best he can. But, boy, he is tough to take. He is a tough guy to take.”
There may be time for Trump to regain his footing with seniors, along with several other right-leaning groups that have drifted away during the bleakest months of his presidency. His ability to do so could have far-reaching implications not just for his chances of winning a second term but also his party’s ability to keep its hold on the Senate.
At the moment, Trump’s unpopularity with older voters appears to be hindering other Republicans in states including Arizona and Michigan.
Gayle Craven, 80, of High Point, North Carolina, said that while she was a registered Republican, she had not voted for Trump in 2016 and would reject him again this year. She said she saw Biden as an “honest man.”
“Trump is the biggest disappointment,” she said. “He has made America look like idiots. I think he’s an embarrassment to my country.”
Other older voters leaning toward Biden cautioned that they could still change their minds, like Frederick Monk, 73, of Mesa, Arizona, who said he had voted for Trump but quickly came to see him as “incompetent.”
Still, Monk said his mind was not fully made up. If Biden chooses an overly liberal running mate, he said he could cast a vote for Trump and hope his second term is an exercise in futility.
“Hopefully the Democrats retake the Senate and make his next four years miserable, if he lasts that long,” Monk said.

Transgender women of color led the uprising at the Stonewall Inn 51 years ago Sunday, but they were never put at the center of the movement they helped start: one whose very shorthand, “the gay rights movement,” erases them.
Although active in the Black Lives Matter movement from the beginning, they have not been prioritized there, either. At no point have Black trans people shared fully in the gains of racial justice or LGBTQ activism, despite suffering disproportionately from the racism, homophobia and transphobia these movements exist to combat.
But now, as the two movements are pulled together by extraordinary circumstances — the protests sparked by the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery; the killings of two Black trans women, Dominique Fells and Riah Milton, shortly after a Black trans man, Tony McDade, was killed by police; a pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color; an economic crisis that has disproportionately affected trans people; and a Supreme Court decision protecting gay and trans people from employment discrimination, all coming to a head during Pride month — Black trans people are mobilizing more visibly than ever before.
This moment, advocates say, is long overdue, and they are determined not to let it slip away.
For decades, the idea that “we were all minorities was enough for people to just say, ‘OK, that’s what we have in common, so if I win, that means you automatically are winning, too,’” said Peppermint, a Black trans activist who co-hosted the Black Queer Town Hall, a three-night series of virtual performances and discussions this month. “I think that the notion of intersectionality is becoming more readily available for people to understand that a win for one group or one identity doesn’t necessarily equal an automatic win for the other.”
While LGBTQ people have secured many legal rights and protections, Black transgender women are still killed so often that the American Medical Association has declared it an epidemic. Last year, 91% of the transgender or gender-nonconforming people who were fatally shot were Black women, according to the Human Rights Campaign. This year, at least 16 trans people have been killed — almost certainly an underestimate because many cases go unreported and many victims are misgendered.
“So much money and resources and energy has been put into legislative fights or judicial fights, which is important — those wins are important,” activist Raquel Willis said. “But as a Black trans woman, I often have to grapple with the question of, what do any of these protections mean if I am dead, if I am still at risk of literally being killed?”
Violence against transgender people increased after President Donald Trump was inaugurated, advocacy groups found in 2017, and Trump has singled out trans people in his policies since the beginning of his presidency.
His administration reversed Barack Obama-era protections for transgender students, reimposed a ban on trans people serving in the military and, just this month, erased rules protecting them from discrimination in health care. It also sought to define gender as an immutable trait assigned at birth — an effort that would, essentially, define trans people out of legal existence.
“The attacks on the trans community are at every level, and it’s coming from the highest office in this country, and it has from Day One,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD. “I think that Black trans people and trans people of color are mobilizing and using this platform and this moment because you can’t have Black lives matter without having Black trans lives matter.”
In recent weeks, donations to grassroots organizations that help Black trans people, bail funds and individual fundraisers have surged.
And two weeks ago, 15,000 people showed up for the Brooklyn Liberation march after the killings of McDade, Fells and Milton.
Willis was one of the speakers at the protest, as was Melania Brown, the sister of Layleen Polanco, who was active in the ballroom scene in New York as a member of the House of Xtravaganza and who died last year after having a seizure in a cell in Rikers Island, where guards failed to check on her.
“Fifteen thousand people should now be the number that always serves as the bare minimum when state-sanctioned violence happens against Black trans people,” said Ianne Fields Stewart, founder of The Okra Project, a collective that provides Black trans people with home-cooked meals prepared by Black trans chefs.
Nala Toussaint, founder of Reuniting of African Descendants, a grassroots healing initiative for LGBTQ people of African descent, said the trans community had always taken care of its own by “making sure that we have food in our stomach, making sure that our folks have housing, making sure that there’s lights and building utilities running.”
What is new is the national visibility of Black trans people as movement leaders and the prominence of their structural demands.
Calls to redistribute police funding to education and public housing could benefit Black transgender people, who, because of widespread transphobia, have some of the highest rates of homelessness and unemployment in the country. More than 1 in 4 transgender people have lost a job because of bias, and more than three-fourths have experienced workplace discrimination, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.
The idea of defunding the police is also tied to efforts to change the criminal justice system more broadly: Peppermint noted, for instance, that decriminalizing sex work could reduce interactions between officers and trans people, especially Black trans women, which can be traumatic or even deadly.
A report from the NCTE found that 22% of transgender people who interacted with police reported harassment. For Black trans people, and especially sex workers, the number was higher.
Black trans activists are also calling for the redistribution of resources within mainstream LGBTQ advocacy organizations that have usually been led by white, cisgender people.
National nonprofits with strong funding “need to get serious about reallocating resources to Black- and brown-led grassroots initiatives,” Willis said, “and they need to really reorient themselves around who they consider to be a leader.”
Historically, mainstream LGBTQ rights groups have focused more on white gay people and lesbians than on trans people or people of color. While that has begun to change, there remains a well of mistrust and a conviction that effective advocacy will need to be led by Black trans people.
“They don’t know the first thing about what it is to live a life like we have, and they have no comprehension as to what it is we suffer and go through,” said Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, one of the last surviving leaders of the Stonewall uprising. “So I myself do not participate in groups that are led by white people, because they just don’t understand.”
That lack of understanding is part of what advocates are trying to address.
Daniella Carter, a Black trans woman from Queens, said that in high school, her classmates seemed to be “just learning what LGBT meant, let alone what transgender meant.”
Carter, now 26, was homeless and did sex work for much of her adolescence. But at times, “it wasn’t navigating survival sex work that felt like it was the burden; it was having to go to school and watch an entire classroom move away from me,” she said. “Because not only was I a burden to that space, there wasn’t even enough language out there yet to talk about what acceptance looked like.”
Her life changed, she said, after she saw Janet Mock on the cover of Marie Claire magazine.
It was the first time she had seen a trans woman “who reflected that woman I always dreamed of — the woman who is Black, who’s powerful, who can present herself chic,” she said. “I said to myself, ‘I don’t know how, but I have to get in touch with this woman.’ I’m like, ‘That’s me, and I need to learn how to be that.’”
Carter did get in touch with Mock and other Black trans activists and eventually went to film school. This weekend, she released a video that highlighted trans people and emphasized their resilience — part of an effort to increase the visibility of trans people’s stories, and not just the ones in which they are victims.
A similar impulse was behind the Black Queer Town Hall, which Peppermint said stemmed from the many conversations she had with Bob the Drag Queen, her friend and co-organizer, about the killings of Black trans people.
“We said to each other, ‘We need to do something that is more celebratory,’” she said. “Because all of the conversation around this only focuses on the terrible parts of this, which need to be talked about, but we wanted a moment to celebrate queer Black excellence.”
The premiere of “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary executive produced by Laverne Cox, has drawn new attention to Hollywood’s depictions of trans people. New York City Pride’s annual rally Friday — held virtually this year — was hosted by two Black trans people, Brian Michael Smith and Ashlee Marie Preston.
This sort of public visibility is very much new. Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, trans women who were key figures in the Stonewall uprising, got a monument in New York last year, although neither lived to see it.
But Miss Major, one of their fellow leaders at Stonewall, is still alive, a fact she phrases in defiant terms: “I’m still here,” with an expletive.
Miss Major, 79, was executive director of the Transgender Gender-Variant Intersex Justice Project and now runs a house for trans people in Arkansas.
She has been vocal about the erasure of Black trans people in the broader LGBTQ movement and said in an interview this past week that while she hoped this moment would be different, she did not expect it to be unless her community fought loudly for itself.
“What I tell the girls is that they’ve got to keep fighting,” she said. “They must keep fighting. Because if they don’t succeed and do the work, we’ll get left behind, and one thing we cannot accept is being left behind this time.”

Hickenlooper Stumbles in Colorado Race, Complicating Democrats’ Senate Push [With graphic(s)]

KREMMLING, Colo. — For months, Democrats have figured that Colorado’s U.S. Senate race, a linchpin of their strategy to take back the majority in November, was essentially in the bag, with the Republican incumbent Cory Gardner trailing by double digits behind their candidate John Hickenlooper, the well-liked and well-known former two-term governor and Denver mayor.
But Hickenlooper, who was coaxed into the Senate contest after ending his brief presidential run, has faltered in recent weeks before the primary race Tuesday. He now finds himself in a tougher-than-expected contest with Andrew Romanoff, a former state House speaker and another longtime Colorado political presence, in a fight with significant implications for the general election and control of the Senate.
At a time when Democrats sense fresh momentum for flipping the Senate amid national crises that have tarnished President Donald Trump and threaten to drag down Republican candidates, Hickenlooper’s shaky primary performance has been a rare dark spot in an otherwise brightening landscape. Democrats would have a difficult time capturing the majority without a Centennial State victory.
“He has had a bad June,” Kyle Saunders, a political-science professor at Colorado State University, said about Hickenlooper’s multiple travails and missteps. Chief among them was a contempt finding by the state’s independent ethics commission for defying a subpoena to appear at a hearing on a complaint against him — an event that prompted disastrous news coverage across the state.
Experts still expect Hickenlooper to win the primary — though perhaps not by the margin initially anticipated — and a recent poll found him with a commanding lead over Romanoff even as ballots are being cast under Colorado’s vote-by-mail system.
But Democrats worry that his rockier-than-expected race may leave him weakened for the general-election fight and give Gardner new life in a campaign where he was a rare incumbent underdog.
“He is limping out of this primary and now has a vulnerability that didn’t exist several weeks ago,” Dick Wadhams, a former state Republican Party chairman and veteran Senate campaign strategist, said about Hickenlooper and his run-in with the ethics panel.
The unexpected volatility of the primary — and the chance to inflict additional damage on Hickenlooper — has generated a last-minute surge of campaign advertising as national Republicans, Gardner and Romanoff have ganged up on Hickenlooper from the right and the left, while national Democrats and an independent group have swooped in to defend the former governor in the primary’s closing days. Millions of dollars are being spent.
Hickenlooper’s troubles go beyond the ethics complaint, which accused him of having improperly accepted private jet and limousine rides as governor.
In a series of forums and debates with his opponent, Hickenlooper, 68, made several eyebrow-raising statements. He said that George Floyd, the black Minneapolis man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck, had been shot. In response to a question about the Black Lives Matter movement, Hickenlooper said that every life matters, a comment considered dismissive of legitimate black grievances. He later acknowledged that he fumbled his response.
Then a 6-year-old video surfaced of Hickenlooper comparing the rigors of a politician’s schedule to working on a slave ship, a remark critics cited as painfully insensitive. He again apologized.
Months earlier, in rejecting appeals to run for the Senate rather than president, Hickenlooper said multiple times that he was not cut out for the Senate and could not see being very good at it, only to turn around and join the race after getting no traction in his White House bid.
Allies of Hickenlooper say he has always lacked the verbal discipline of a typical politician — and that is part of the quirky, authentic personality that voters have come to appreciate and admire.
“Colorado voters know John Hickenlooper really, really well,” said Melissa Miller, a campaign spokeswoman. “What people really like about him is he is a real guy. He is not a slick, talking-point politician.” (The campaign declined to make Hickenlooper available for an interview.)
Hickenlooper’s gaffes would have provided negative campaign fodder in any event, but the biggest error came in his handling of a complaint filed by Republicans in 2018 that accused him of improperly taking gifts and private jet trips as governor.
Subpoenaed to testify on June 4 in a virtual hearing because of the pandemic, Hickenlooper and his legal adviser instead argued for a delay so he could appear later in person without the distractions and glitches of an online proceeding. He was then a no-show for the teleconference and the ethics commission held him in contempt, setting off a wave of negative coverage that made it appear as if he was not taking the complaint seriously.
Chastened, Hickenlooper testified the next day, defending the trips as either personal business or efforts to promote Colorado. But the commission eventually fined him $2,750 for two violations and refused to vacate its contempt finding.
National Republicans, who were always planning to hit Hickenlooper on the ethics question, accelerated their planned post-primary advertising to take advantage of the furor and aired a spot that rounded up news coverage hammering the former governor.
“We did it because of how badly Hick was mishandling the ethics hearing,” said Kevin McLaughlin, head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “He and his team were bumbling idiots, and we felt like we couldn’t let the opportunity pass.”
Romanoff, who lost a Denver-area House race in 2014 and a primary battle for the Senate in 2010, has also taken Hickenlooper to task on the ethics issue, drawing rebukes from other Democrats who have urged him to drop the attacks.
By embracing “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal, Romanoff has sought to contrast himself with Hickenlooper’s more moderate image and tap into the growing progressive bloc of Colorado Democrats who helped Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont win the state’s presidential primary this year with 37% of the vote.
Romanoff also said Hickenlooper’s campaign effort has validated the former governor’s original claim that he wasn’t that interested in joining the Senate.
“We haven’t detected any enthusiasm for his candidacy, including from him,” Romanoff said in an interview. “I just think it has been an appalling performance. There is nothing he has done in this campaign to convince me that he was wrong when he said he would be a terrible senator.”
Hoping to counter Romanoff’s criticism and a perception in some Democratic circles that he is out of step with the state’s evolving Democratic electorate, the Hickenlooper campaign has touted endorsements from Washington figures such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, both of whom joined Hickenlooper in the presidential primary field.
“I feel like the momentum has changed in the last few days,” Hickenlooper said in a local television interview that aired Friday, crediting the national endorsements and a rush of local and state Democrats who switched their backing from Romanoff to him after an attack ad from his rival.
With Hickenlooper under fire, Gardner has also plunged into the fray. His opening campaign ad mocked Hickenlooper’s early comments about his lack of interest in being in the Senate, with Gardner pretending to be a therapist and noting that Hickenlooper has some issues to work through.
“To do this job, you probably need to want this job,” a smiling Gardner says at the end.
Republican strategists say they believe that Gardner, a polished campaigner who led the party’s Senate campaign organization in 2016, could hold off Hickenlooper given the weaknesses the former governor has displayed in the primary.
Yet even with Hickenlooper’s troubles, Democrats and analysts say that Gardner’s fate is tied to that of Trump, who lost the state in 2016 to Hillary Clinton and is trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in polls here.
They say that Gardner, who early on endorsed the president for reelection, has not done enough to separate himself from Trump, who was an anchor on the senator’s campaign even before the president’s most recent decline in popularity.
“There is too much drag on him from the president and it is getting even worse,” said Floyd Ciruli, a longtime pollster and Colorado political analyst. “I just have a hard time seeing Cory being able to beat that tide.”

A majority of American voters support the demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice that have roiled the country over the past month, embracing ideas about bias within the criminal justice system and the persistence of systemic racism that are central tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement, according to a new national poll of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College.
Fifty-nine percent of voters, including 52% of white voters, believe the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis was “part of a broader pattern of excessive police violence toward African Americans,” the poll found. The Black Lives Matter movement and the police had similar favorability ratings, with 44% of registered voters viewing the movement as “very favorable,” almost identical to the 43% rating for the police.
The numbers add to the mounting evidence that recent protests have significantly shifted public opinion on race, creating potential political allies for a movement that was, within the past decade, dismissed as fringe and divisive. It also highlights how President Donald Trump is increasingly out of touch with a country he is seeking to lead for a second term: While he has shown little sympathy for the protesters and their fight for racial justice, and has continued to use racist language that many have denounced, voters feel favorably toward the protests and their cause.
A survey of battleground states critical to November’s election largely mirrored the national results. Fifty-four percent of voters in those states said the way the criminal justice system treats Black Americans was a bigger problem than the incidents of rioting seen during some demonstrations. Just 37% said rioting was a bigger problem, though Trump and his allies have tried to discredit the protests by focusing on some isolated incidents of violence.
It has not worked.
“I probably didn’t understand what bringing people together meant until Trump started talking the way he does,” said Rita Hopkins, 55, from rural Clark County, Missouri, in the northeastern part of the state. “Now I see what a president says can divide people.”
Hopkins, a white registered Democrat who describes herself as a centrist, said she was particularly galled by Trump’s comments at one point during protests over Floyd’s death that the Secret Service had been prepared to sic the “most vicious dogs” on protesters outside the White House gates.
The words immediately brought to mind photos of Alabama police aiming snarling dogs at peaceful Black protesters.
“I hate to say it, but I had forgotten about those pictures I had seen,” said Hopkins, who lives in an overwhelmingly Republican county. “I kind of thought we had gotten past that.”
The attitudes cut across race, geography and educational status, and speak to a country that has been awakened through protests to complaints that Black Americans have long made about police brutality and systemic racism. What began in the Democratic primary, in which white liberals showed a new openness to candidates speaking frankly about systemic injustice, has continued into the general election, with a spotlight on Trump’s response.
The coalition of people sympathetic to the protesters’ cause, including Latino voters, exposes the limits of Trump’s tendency to exclusively speak directly to his overwhelmingly white and conservative base. As with other issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, the administration’s narrow focus has been derided by experts and voters, who say the governing strategy does not reflect the country’s broader interests, or the current political realities.
“Over the past six years, so much of the work has been focused on convincing the country — and convincing policymakers and white communities that there’s an actual problem,” said Samuel Sinyangwe, an activist and co-founder of Mapping Police Violence. “Now there’s been universal condemnation of the George Floyd incident and a recognition that things needs to change.”
Aaron Perry, an alderman on the City Council of Waukesha, Wisconsin, said he doesn’t support the looting that took place after Floyd’s death in various cities but said it occurred on a small scale relative to the peaceful protests that broke out.
Perry, a 40-year-old white man, describes himself as a centrist but was compelled to switch parties last year from Republican to Democrat because of his support for marriage equality and legalization of cannabis. He called himself a “never-Trumper” and said that in 2016, he wrote in John Kasich, then the governor of Ohio, on the presidential ballot.
The death of Floyd was an urgent message to the nation, he said, to make changes to end the kinds of police and societal behavior that led to the incident.
“This is the last time we have a chance to get this right. I’m on board with that,” Perry said, emphasizing, with an expletive, that he really didn’t care if “most of the people I represent don’t look like” Floyd, and that issues of racial justice matter for a majority-white area, too.
Darrell Keaton Sr., a 49-year-old Black Democrat from Wausau, Wisconsin, several hours north of Perry, said the protests after Floyd’s death were monumental for changing views on structural racism in America. Finally, he said, it feels like white people are listening and joining in the protests.
“We have just been racking our brains and screaming at the top of our lungs for so many years that we’re going to need other people to stand up alongside the Black community to change anything,” he said.
Though the poll overall shows former Vice President Joe Biden in a very strong position, especially on racial justice, and voters’ belief in his ability to unite a divided country, it also indicates how difficult a task that could be: More than 40% of white respondents agreed in some measure that discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as other forms of discrimination, reinforcing a theme of white grievance politics that the president and his supporters have long expressed.
There are also broad generational gaps between how voters are responding to the national moment of unrest. Every age bracket said the use of force by the police against Black Americans was a bigger problem than looting at demonstrations, however support for Black Lives Matter gets more tepid among older voters, the polls found. Sixty-seven percent of voters ages 18 to 29 viewed the Black Lives Matter movement as “very favorable” as did 54% of voters ages 30 to 44.
Among people 45 to 64, the support dropped to 37%, while 22% viewed the movement as “somewhat favorable.” Voters 65 and over were the least persuaded: Only 31% had a “very favorable” view of the Black Lives Matter movement, and 25% had a “somewhat favorable” opinion.
Michael Berlinger, 67, who lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and considers himself an independent voter, said he thinks the Black Lives Matter movement is too myopic. The protests over Floyd’s death have been too destructive, he said.
“The whole message has been undermined in a lot of ways,” said Berlinger, a white retired teacher. “I’m not a big fan of people who break the law to say they’re working for a cause. I don’t think that’s the correct way of doing it.”
The looting and the property destruction were “a dilution of the message and the results they wanted to achieve.” Berlinger is likely to vote for Trump, he said, but he described the choices on the Republican and Democratic ballots, respectively, as one between “a lunatic and a senile senior citizen.”
“I think all lives matter,” Berlinger said. “The Black and blue lives, and red, white and blue lives.”
Charles Defever, a 28-year-old Minneapolis Democrat, said he felt this was a moment to get more involved. His activism was limited to the occasional comment in support of Black Lives Matter on social media — until he saw the video of George Floyd’s arrest, he said.
“I was not very active, and my interest would fade,” said Defever, who is white and works as a produce buyer for a food wholesaler. “I would write on the Black Lives Matter page and see truth and pain and hurt in so many people I know but would not go out and protest.”
“I’ve spent a lot of time at the state Capitol listening to young Black and brown youth speak about the world they want, and that’s the world I have,” he said.
Defever was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont but said he planned to vote for Biden because he was “better than having destructive Republican policies and leadership.”
Many activists, progressive political groups, and civil rights organizations draw a direct line to these changing attitudes and the events of the recent months. Renewed attention ignited by the death of Floyd — as well as others who died at the hands of police, including Breonna Taylor of Kentucky, Rayshard Brooks of Georgia, and Elijah McClain of Colorado — has built on other moments of awakening, like the surprise of the 2016 election of Trump, said Nell Irvin Painter, a historian and author of “The History of White People.”
“The great stall point after the civil rights movement was white people not being able to talk to other white people about whiteness,” Painter said. “That has to happen before anything can change. Now, many white people are stepping up and saying, ‘Oh we’ve got to talk about this.’”
D’Atra Jackson, national director for Black Youth Project 100, the progressive political organization that has been on the front lines of the national protests, agreed that this is a unique political moment. However, Jackson said it is important to maintain pressure on people seeking elected office so that public sympathy can be transformed into action — getting people elected and getting legislation passed.
“It’s one thing to be hopeful and believe that new things are possible,” Jackson said. “It’s another thing to build power.”

Full text: Interviews with superdelegates and members of a Biden-Sanders task force found near-unanimous sentiment for redirecting money away from policing, with positions beyond what Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proposed.
WASHINGTON -- A month after the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis ignited a wave of nationwide protests, Democratic Party officials are expressing broad support for significantly reallocating funds away from police departments, with positions that go well beyond that of the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Interviews with 54 Democratic National Committee members, convention superdelegates and members of a criminal justice task force convened by Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders found a near-unanimous sentiment that local governments should redirect more money toward social services, education and mental health agencies.
Very few advocate fully defunding or abolishing the police, as some activists have called for. But they are aligning themselves, as have city councils in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Denver, Portland, Ore., and other cities, with an increasingly popular movement to drastically rethink the priorities surrounding law enforcement.
Their views exceed those adopted by Mr. Biden, who opposes defunding but has proposed policing changes and said that federal aid to police departments should be conditioned on meeting "basic standards of decency and honorableness." They also go further than what the Biden-Sanders task force will recommend to the party's platform committee and the Biden campaign later this month, according to several members of the group.
"Governments are going to have to look at how they can reallocate money," said Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader. "Of course it's a good idea if we have more social services rather than police because police are to be our guardians rather than warriors. There are a lot of things we'd rather have a sociologist work through rather than a guy with a gun and a holster."
The issue could prove delicate for Mr. Biden as he works to unite the party's disparate factions -- including a still-skeptical progressive wing -- into a coalition that can defeat President Trump in November, while rebutting the president's strategy of attacking Democrats as weak on "law and order." There is clear tension not only between Mr. Biden and the party's base, but between the moderate voters Mr. Biden needs to win the general election and the more liberal voters who populate Democratic primaries.
A New York Times and Siena College national poll released this week shed light on the diverging viewpoints. It found 63 percent of registered voters oppose spending less money on the police. But among Mr. Biden's supporters, 55 percent favor reducing the amount of resources spent on law enforcement.
Stacey Walker, a county supervisor from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, whom Mr. Sanders appointed to the criminal justice task force, supports the movement to defund police departments and has been pushing the Biden-Sanders task force toward more sweeping proposals. He suggested that Mr. Biden had not yet caught up to the energy and sentiment that is currently motivating many in the party.
"It seems to me right now that the vice president certainly understands the need for police reform, but I think his vision is a little different from some of the progressive activists on the ground," Mr. Walker said.
The activism in the party over law enforcement and racial injustice has already had an impact on Democratic politics. It helped boost Jamaal Bowman to a wide lead over Representative Eliot Engel in a New York primary election on Tuesday, and elevated Charles Booker into position to score an upset in the Kentucky Senate primary.
More evidence emerged this week that incremental change isn't sufficient for Democratic lawmakers, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-led effort toward changing police practices that they said did not do enough to address racial inequities.
Of the 54 Democratic officials surveyed, only four said they opposed shifting funds away from law enforcement agencies.
"When it comes to the police, it seems they have to do every job that is asked of them," said former Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. of Providence, R.I., who is a member of the D.N.C. "I feel strongly that they are here to protect us from crime and that they deserve our support."
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said that "bringing our nation together to overcome systemic racism is at the heart of Joe Biden's agenda," adding that Mr. Biden would fight for a range of programs as well as for "new grants for the community policing that is proven to improve relationships and reduce violence."
"He believes policing funding should be conditioned on local law enforcement reforms to stop these horrible tragedies," Mr. Bates said.
The issue of reallocating law enforcement funds is so new to the mainstream Democratic Party discussion that during the entirety of the 2020 presidential primary, not a single major candidate uttered the phrase "defund the police."
Instead Mr. Sanders touted his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Vt., when he gave police officers pay raises. His campaign was centered on divisions related to economic injustice, rather than the explicit calls for racial justice that have animated the demonstrations since the Floyd killing.
"Those of us who supported Bernie in 2016 and this year have a lot to learn about racial justice and policing," said Larry Cohen, the chairman of the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution. "It is a core issue that must be directly addressed and not just as part of broader issues."
Even Julián Castro, the former Housing secretary who offered the most far-reaching criminal justice proposals among the 28 Democrats who ran for president, didn't call for spending less money on law enforcement. He said recent events had cast into sharp relief the need to adjust the approach to that issue.
"Cities spend a huge portion of their local budgets on traditional armed policing when situations on the ground don't require traditional armed policing," said Mr. Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio. "There's no question that what's happened in the last few weeks has channeled, directed and broadened the calls for change."
Demands to reduce police funding range from abolishing departments entirely, and immediately, to phasing out tasks that have long been assigned to law enforcement. Ted Terry, a D.N.C. member who is the former mayor of Clarkston, Ga., called for a 50 percent reduction in police budgets over 10 years. "Racial justice is absolutely the most prominent and important issue right now," Mr. Terry said.
Yet while his party pushes for allocating fewer resources to police departments, Mr. Biden has proposed directing an additional $ 300 million toward local law enforcement community policing efforts, funds his campaign said would come with restrictions on use-of-force rules and requirements that departments spend more on social programs.
There is some hope among Democrats advocating change that Mr. Biden will eventually adopt policies reversing his career-long direction of funneling more federal funds to police departments.
"If he stopped here I wouldn't be satisfied, but I know that he is evolving," said Ron Harris, a Democratic National Committee member from Minneapolis. "He is listening and I anticipate that the more he listens and the more we advocate for these things that he'll respond accordingly."
The issue has complicated matters on the criminal justice task force that was formed by the Biden and Sanders campaigns after Mr. Sanders dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr. Biden. When it was first convened in mid-May, the group of eight was expected to focus on the decriminalization of marijuana and phasing out the for-profit private prison system.
After Mr. Floyd's killing, the conversation turned toward policing, and the task force has considered proposals as robust as abolishing police departments entirely. In the end, though, the group's recommendations to the Biden campaign and the D.N.C.'s platform committee will not include reducing money for law enforcement, according to people familiar with its plans.
Yet even Mr. Biden's appointees to the task force said a potential Biden administration should consider what incentives it offers local governments to redirect its law enforcement resources.
"You can't go downstream and say, 'Why aren't there any fish?"' said Raumesh Akbari, a Tennessee state senator from Memphis who was appointed by the Biden campaign to serve on the task force. "You have to go to the top of the river and figure out what the problem is there."
The Democrats who urge shrinking police budgets say it would reverse decades of policies that have shifted funds away from social services toward police departments.
"I support law enforcement, and that means realigning their mandate and stop being asked to respond to the social service needs which our elected officials have ignored for far too long," said Alma Gonzalez, a Democratic National Committee member from Tampa, Fla.
As liberal activists and demonstrators have rallied around the "defund the police" slogan, President Trump and his Republican allies have argued that a Biden presidency would lead to chaotic scenes across American cities. In an effort to stoke those anxieties, the president has tweeted the phrase "law & order" 16 times since Mr. Floyd was killed.
The vast majority of Democrats interviewed did not seem worried about Mr. Trump's attacks, and said they saw little risk in having Mr. Trump portray them as weak on law and order issues as long as they were making practical policy proposals for redirecting police funding to other social service agencies. The bigger risk, most of them said, is for Mr. Biden to alienate an energized base -- exposing a potentially damaging schism in his coalition.
"We, as black citizens, will no longer accept the minimum from the Democrats," said Ray McKinnon, a Democratic National Committee member from Charlotte, N.C. "We will not accept the 'tough on crime' Biden or Clintons. Those days have passed and we demand that black and brown folks are centered."

Two days after George Floyd was killed by the police, Zee Thomas, 15, posted a tweet: “If my mom says yes I’m leading a Nashville protest.”
Thomas had never been to a protest, let alone organized one. And yet five days later, with the help of five other teenagers, she was leading a march through her city, some 10,000 strong.
“We didn’t have a podium or anything, we were standing on water coolers to speak,” Thomas said. “I’m an introvert, and when I got up there I was like, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing?’ But I kept going.”
The girls didn’t know it at the time, but in cities across the country, legions of other young activists were doing something similar.
In San Ramon, California, Tiana Day, 17, led a Black Lives Matter protest across the Golden Gate Bridge, after responding to a post on Instagram from another young woman, Mimi Zoila, 19. (Zoila, who is white, had secured a permit for the protest, but was looking for someone from the Black community to lead it. Day sent her a message.) Day thought “something like 50 people would show up.” There were thousands, stretching for miles.
In Chicago, Shayla Turner, 18, spent part of her high school graduation week campaigning to remove police from inside Chicago’s public schools. She has been on the front lines of the city’s protests and cleanup efforts, where she saw people tear gassed for the first time. It has not deterred her (though it has worried her mother).
And from her bedroom in St. Louis, where she lives with her parents while on break from college, Brianna Chandler, 19, was using social media to organize a teach-in for local high school and college students to learn about racial justice. Two older activists called in, including Cori Bush, who is running for Congress; another girl, part of a local arts troupe, read a poem about police brutality.
“I think that educating people is essential to movement building,” said Chandler, who is also active in the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate justice organization.
Teen girls have long been at the forefront of social progress. Think Malala Yousufzai, Emma González or Greta Thunberg.
So have Black women. It was three Black women — Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi — who founded the Black Lives Matter organization. Black women led early movements for voting rights and have organized some of the most successful campaigns for civil rights.
These teenagers are stepping up to continue that legacy.
By Zoom from their homes (and in a series of follow-ups), The New York Times spoke with Thomas, Day, Turner and Chandler about racial justice, youth activism and what they hope for the future. (This interview was edited and condensed.)
Q: Zee and Tiana, neither of you had ever led a protest before. What propelled you?
ZEE, 15: It’s crazy. I’ve never been to a protest before — like, ever. This is my first protest and probably not my only one, but being that I didn’t have the experience, I didn’t know what to do. I got inspired by what people were doing all across America, but there was no protest in Nashville at the time. I was like, why isn’t Tennessee doing anything? Why are they silent?
So I was like, enough is enough. We’re going to do something. I got on social media. Social media was like my best friend when it comes to this. I met my other organizers there. They contacted me on Twitter and Instagram. They were like, can I help? I was like, sure.
I was nervous to talk to my mom at first. I said, “Mom, if I do this, would you be OK with it?” She didn’t question me, which was really surprising. She was like, “I’m going to be behind you every step of the way.” And that’s what really set it off.
TIANA, 17: For me, I was never really an activist before. But this movement lit a fire in me.
I live in San Ramon, a suburban town in California, and I’ve grown up around people who didn’t look like me my whole life. And I’ve been constantly trying to fit in. I would stay out of the sun so I wouldn’t tan. I would straighten my hair every day. There’s so many things that I did to try to suppress who I was and what my culture was. And it’s sick now to think of it. I just never felt like myself.
But I have always had this, like, boiling thing , this boiling passion in my body to want to make a change in the world. I just never knew what it was. So when Mimi, my co-organizer, commented on an Instagram post about needing a leader for a protest, I DM-ed her. We organized the entire thing in 18 hours, pushing out a single flyer.
We bought three cases of water because we thought it was enough. It was like four miles straight of people who were there to support the movement and honestly, most of them weren’t even Black. They were allies. It was so beautiful.
I think I found myself through this movement.
Q: You are each leading major actions with thousands of people, typically organizing from the bedrooms where you live with your parents. How have your families responded?
SHAYLA, 18: My mom actually found out I was protesting through the newspaper. She was in Walgreens and did a double take because I was on the cover of the The Chicago Tribune. She called me, and I was so scared, because I had lied to her and said that I was going out with my friends that day.
She was like, “I remember that day, you lied to my face!” But I had to. She doesn’t really think it’s safe, and she doesn’t want me out there. But at the end of the day, I’m going to be out there and it’s better for me to tell her where I am. It actually brought us closer. We keep having these sentimental moments where she’s just super-proud of me and she’ll start crying.
TIANA: My dad is from Richmond, which is a rougher part of the Bay Area. And he worked his butt off — he worked five jobs at one point — to make sure that we could live in a house in a nice area. I think he kind of sheltered me, or tried to shelter me, from the hardships of being a Black American.
And come to find out, my dad was part of the movement against police brutality after Rodney King. My grandfather was part of the Black Panther movement. I have so much Black history in my life.
Q: You never knew about this before?
TIANA: Not until two weeks ago! At the protest, I spoke about how I’ve lived in my city for over 15 years and police still racially profile my family. When my dad is driving, they pull him over and run his plates and ask him where he’s going. He says, “Home, like the rest of you.” We all live in this community, and it’s sad to see my Black brothers and sisters discriminated against. We have the right to live here just like you do, but we have to work two times harder to get here.When I finished speaking, my dad was crying. He said, “You remind me of myself.” I was like, “Why?” And he goes, “Because I was an activist at your age.” I said, “What? Why didn’t you tell me?” I was so mad at him! He said, “Yeah, your great-grandfather was too.” So now I know, it’s in my blood.
Q: Brianna, you grew up in St. Louis, where you said that your parents put books about Black liberation in your hands as soon as you could read. Do you think that led to your activism as an adult ?
BRIANNA, 19: My parents pushed me to become educated about Black history in part because they worked really hard to put me in private schools. And they knew that going to a predominantly white institution would not teach me about my history.
When I have gone to marches in the past, my dad has always been there with me. But I’ve never really been what I consider to be “on the front lines.” Most of what I do is online. So when I realized that I wouldn’t be able to actually go anywhere to protests, due to COVID and safety concerns, I just kind of sat down and typed out how I was feeling.
I posted, and then I kept thinking and writing and posting and it grew from there. What I call “consciousness raising,” because I think that educating people is essential to movement building. There are a lot of different parts of a movement.
Q: Shayla, you were part of a youth climate strike last year, where you gave a speech in front of thousands. You also said you had a fear of public speaking. How did you overcome that?
SHAYLA: I’ve always been really outspoken, but also really introverted. But my junior year, there was a youth climate strike and I just felt like I had to speak out. I go to a predominantly Black and Brown school on the Southwest side of Chicago, and there were three teachers who really inspired me to use my voice. They stayed late with me and practiced my speech over and over. The day before, I vomited three times because I was so nervous.
But I did it, and I did it damn well. I think I just had a choice to either keep my voice in or speak out and continue. And right after my speech, I was like, “So when’s the next one? I’m here.”
BRIANNA: I just want to shout out Shayla, because climate justice is racial justice. Black Lives Matter isn’t just about eliminating police brutality. It’s about dismantling all systems that endanger Black people.
Q: What’s something about your generation that people get wrong?
BRIANNA: That our anger is not valid, that we don’t have a reason to be angry, that we don’t have a reason to riot. You know, there is that super-popular Malcolm X quote: “The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman.”
It’s the idea that Black women have to say things nicely, or they have to say things using standard English, or that they’re ignorant if they speak using African American vernacular English. I think what the world gets wrong is that the anger of Black women isn’t valid — and it is. It’s more valid than I think any white person can comprehend.
ZEE: I also want people to know that we’re not strong all the time. We’re allowed to be weak. We are teenagers, we’re young women, and we’re allowed to be emotional, especially when we see people of our skin color getting killed.
As Black women, we’re often expected to be the higher person. We’re expected to be stronger and more diligent when it comes to our emotions. I think the stereotype about Black women being strong is true. But we’re people just like everybody else, we experience emotions like everybody else.
Q: How are you all taking care of yourselves right now?
SHAYLA: I’ve been taking rest days, and sometimes I’ll delete social media for a couple of hours and watch movies or do something that makes me happy. It just gets so exhausting seeing a new name and a new hashtag.
TIANA: I try to space out a free day. Like, tomorrow I will have absolutely nothing planned. Yesterday I had absolutely nothing planned. And with all the attention the movement is getting, especially on young Black people who are leading these protests, I think it’s important we turn certain opportunities down because you can’t do everything.
ZEE: I try to focus on what I’m doing at the moment and just live in it. And that’s how my mental health has improved within these past few days. Because of course, every time you go on social media there’s always something happening. Like, you get burned out from hearing that news. You get burned out because that’s the life we have to live.
Mental health in the Black community isn’t taken very seriously. And a lot of our parents, or our parents’ parents, have mental health problems and that goes on to the future generations without any help. So I feel like, as far as mental health right now, you have to just live in the moment. Because personally, if I think about the future, that just makes me more anxious.
Q: When’s the last time you did something to feel like a teen?
ZEE: Oh gosh. I don’t even know! That’s kind of sad, isn’t it?
BRIANNA: I think the most normal thing I do is just watch TV. Like stuff about vampires and werewolves, stuff that’s not based on reality, to help me de-stress.
Q: Where do you want to see the movement go from here?
SHAYLA: I want to see an entire revolution led by youth. I feel like we are definitely capable of that. We have the power and we have the voices.
Q: Why do you think we are seeing so many young women leading?
ZEE: Because we are tired. Our generation had to grow up too quickly in order to make sure our younger siblings and even our kids will grow up in a world where we are equal and free to be who we are regardless of skin color or gender identity or sexuality.
Q: Do you think there’s a difference in the way your generation is approaching this movement from those who’ve come before you?
BRIANNA: I will say that sometimes the more popular elder activists are reformist. And I think that my generation is kind of calling for abolition rather than reform. Like, we don’t just want to give police body cameras. We want to get rid of the police because we don’t feel like they’re making anyone safer. We don’t feel like they’re making our neighborhoods better.
And that’s not new. Like, Angela Davis has been saying that, many radical Black people of the past have been saying it. I think people are just becoming more aware of it.
Q: What gives you hope ?
TIANA: How many people are sticking up and starting protests.
BRIANNA: Seeing all of the people who are going beyond social media to educate themselves — donating, reading and having conversations with their friends and family.
SHAYLA: Chicago youth give me hope. Everyone in my close friend group is involved within this movement, and many others. That’s kind of normal for kids here, because everyone cares.
ZEE: After the protest, I really couldn’t sleep at all. I was on Twitter, as usual. And there was this one tweet from a mother. And I remember it so clearly, because I started crying. She said, “I’m happy that my daughter will grow up in a world that these young girls will change.”
And that’s a moment where I felt really powerful, because my main goal, as a person and as an upcoming activist, is to make sure that people know that things will change. Eventually.

NEW YORK — Cherish Patton recalled springing into action when a friend sent her a message that a New York City police officer had grabbed a petite protester by her hood and had flung her to the pavement.
Patton, who has organized several Black Lives Matter protests, posted a plea on social media for help identifying the officer. She also called her friend for details on the protester, who had been whisked to the emergency room. “Oh, it’s Michelle,” her friend told her.
“Wait, white Michelle who I argued with for three years? White Michelle?” asked an astonished, and confused, Patton, who is Black. The hurt protester was a former classmate, Michelle Moran, 18, whose conservative commentary on politics and social issues had made Patton, 18, cringe in high school in Manhattan.
George Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis pushed anguished Black people into the streets, as had happened countless times after police killings of Black people. But this time, the Black protesters have been joined en masse by white people, in rallies across New York City and around the country.
Now, though, the protests in New York City are ebbing somewhat, though they are still drawing thousands of people to some events, particularly on weekends. And outside City Hall, there is a growing encampment of diverse demonstrators who are demanding deep cuts in the police budget.
And so that naturally raises a question for Black activists who have long been dedicated to the movement: Will the commitment of white protesters endure?
Some of the white protesters identify as liberal and said they had long been sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement but had not done much, if anything, before to show it. Other white people said they had once believed that police did not discriminate against Black people but had changed their minds because of Floyd’s killing.
Some Black people have responded to the influx of white protesters with a mix of hope, I-told-you-so sentiment and skepticism. For longtime activists, there is a frustration that it took a global pandemic and yet another death at the hands of police to push white people to publicly embrace the movement. They wonder how long white people will keep showing up.
“We see so many white people who hate us, absolutely hate us for the way that we look,” Patton said, adding, “To see white people on the front lines, it’s exciting to know that these younger generations of white people care.
“This is a different level of protest.”
Still, some Black protesters and activists expressed ambivalence about the shift.
Opal Tometi, 35, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, called the outpouring “beautiful,” but she added, “I have minor trepidation, like most, that this could end up being a trend.
“When the social media posts die down, will the actions and people’s conviction for change die down too?” she said in written responses to questions. “I have been waiting for this moment since I was 12 years old as the only Black kid on the block. I’ve always known I’ve been a part of something bigger than myself. I didn’t know how it would unfold, but here we are.”
Anthony Beckford, president of Black Lives Matter Brooklyn, recalled being at a protest in Brooklyn and feeling uneasy about the large numbers of white people who had shown up.
“I looked around and I was like, ‘I feel outnumbered. Is my life in danger?’ ” said Beckford, 38, who added that he feared that some of the protesters were white nationalists infiltrating the march.
He said he and his friends have had to tell some white protesters that they could not just show up and take over.
“Our fight is our fight. Their privilege can amplify the message, but they can never speak for us,” Beckford said. “There have been moments where some have wanted to be in the front. I’ve told them to go to the back.”
Two young white people new to the movement tried to organize a protest in Bay Ridge that Beckford found out about from other white people. He said he shut it down. “Their messaging was, ‘Yes, Black lives matter, and police lives matter, too.’ I was like, no. You can think of the ‘Kumbaya’ moment when we get our mission accomplished,” he said.
Research does seem to confirm Black protesters’ sense that they have been joined for the first time at demonstrations against police brutality by large numbers of white protesters.
One study of the Floyd protests on one weekend this month found overwhelmingly young crowds, with large numbers of white and highly educated people. White protesters made up 61% of those surveyed in New York, according to the researchers, and 65% of protesters in Washington. In Los Angeles, 53% of protesters were white.
Opinion polls have also shown that racial attitudes among white Americans have been shifting, with a sharp turn by white liberals toward a more sympathetic view of Black people.
Moran, the injured white protester whose plight was noticed by Patton, said she was a newcomer to the movement. She said her parents and a childhood in a predominantly white block of Woodlawn, in the Bronx, initially shaped her worldview and politics.
“I slowly but surely opened my eyes to the horrors of the criminal justice system,” said Moran, who said she turned a corner a year ago, influenced by readings, the news and the documentary “Requiem for the American Dream” about income inequality.
As for her parents, Moran said, “I’m still trying to change them, but they’re not budging.”
Patton, her voice hoarse from daily chants and speeches, said she remains skeptical of some white protesters who she believes are showing up to “wreak havoc.”
But talking now with Moran, Patton said she saw that some white people were willing to be allies.
The teenagers have gone from barely speaking to now having a mutual respect for each other, they said.
These issues are playing out in school settings across the city as well.
When Theo Schimmel, 14, who identifies as white and Indian, decided to hold a protest for children in Washington Heights, where he lives, he reached out to his classmates from Bank Street School, Melany Linton, who identifies as Afro-Latina, and Stella Tillery-Lee, who is Black.
Asked whether he chose them because they were Black, Theo paused and then said, “Yeah, but I didn’t really focus on that aspect of it. I knew how important this was to them in classes.”
Stella, 14, who lives in Harlem, said she appreciated that Theo took the step that he did. “We definitely need more people that are not necessarily African American or Black helping to support our community because so many people are being bystanders, which is great, but it’s not enough at all,” she said.
About 300 people showed up to join Stella, Melany and Theo on a lawn in Fort Tryon Park.
“Throughout history, people see Black people as inhuman or as objects, and that’s ridiculous,” Melany said in an interview. “The fact that so many things, like what happened to George Floyd, continue to go on in our country is so upsetting and disturbing that it really does strike a certain nerve in people, as it should.”
Among the protesters were teachers Ever Ramirez, who is Asian, and Shelby Brody, who is white. They held signs reading, “DEFUND THE POLICE. INVEST IN SCHOOLS” and “ASIANS FOR BLACK LIVES MATTER.”
Brody said they had learned more about themselves and racism by reading the book “White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo and taking part in a group at school where white employees explored racism and their role in it.
Brody had initially steered clear of the group. “I was called in by a colleague of color who rightly said, ‘White people sitting out is part of the problem,’ ” Brody said.
Also at the park protest was one of Melany’s family friends, April Dinwoodie, 48, who splits her time between Harlem and Westerly, Rhode Island, where 95% of the residents are white.
A biracial woman raised in the town by her white adoptive parents with white siblings, Dinwoodie said she moved to Harlem years ago as she searched for a connection to “my Blackness.”
Driving through the town recently, she said she could not believe what she saw. There they were, dozens of Westerly residents holding a Black Lives Matter protest.
“I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ ” she said, almost giddy. “I had to stop and pull over because I was crying, because my little town was having a protest. And I said, ‘Well, look at that. That’s new. That’s new to me.’
“Quite frankly,” she said, “I didn’t expect much from my town.”
For years now, mainly Black people have been on the front lines of issues that affect Black people, said Adilka Pimentel, 30, a lead organizer at Make the Road New York who identifies as Black Dominican.
Pimentel has been involved in activism for a long time, since she was 14 years old. She pointed out that with the Floyd protests, more white people have the advantages of reliable health care, higher incomes and savings to take to the streets at a time when Black people have been especially hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
“The same way that essential workers are mostly Black and brown and account for most of the deaths of COVID, they can’t be out there because they have to feed their families,” she said.
She said she realized that social justice movements ebb and flow and hoped that the new protesters remained part of the movement.
“I worry about all the support dying down, mostly because it’s what happens. Eric Garner. It died down. Mike Brown. It died down. Ferguson. It died down,” Pimentel said. “The hope is that it stays. Those of us who have been doing the work are going to continue to do the work. If we feel like it starts to slip, we can be here to pick it up.”
Patton, the protest organizer, stood on 125th Street in Harlem recently at yet another gathering she had organized, this one to recognize Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky.
As she looked over the crowd and prepared to welcome them, a white man, a stranger, handed her a megaphone.
“Could the white man who brought this help us figure it out?” she asked, laughing. The crowd laughed with her.
The man walked up and hit a button to amplify her voice.
Patton put the megaphone to her mouth. The crowd had grown to hundreds in just a few minutes.
“I am so overwhelmed at how many of you came out!” she shouted. “Thank you for coming!”

It’s the difference between black and Black. A longtime push by African American scholars and writers to capitalize the word black in the context of race has gained acceptance in recent weeks and unleashed a deep debate over identity, race and power.
Hundreds of news organizations over the past month have changed their style to Black in reference to the race of people, including The Associated Press, long considered an influential arbiter of journalism style. Far more than a typographical change, the move is part of a generations-old struggle over how best to refer to those who trace their ancestry to Africa.
The capitalization of black, which has been pushed for years, strikes at deeper questions over the treatment of people of African descent, who were stripped of their identities and enslaved in centuries past, and whose struggles to become fully accepted as part of the American experience continue to this day.
“Blackness fundamentally shapes any core part of any Black person’s life in the U.S. context, and really around the world,” said Brittney Cooper, an associate professor at Rutgers University whose latest book, “Eloquent Rage,” explores Black feminism. “In the choice to capitalize, we are paying homage to a history with a very particular kind of political engagement.”
The move toward Black is not embraced by all African Americans, and two of the country’s major news outlets, The New York Times and The Washington Post, are still wrestling over whether to make the change. (The New York Times News Service, however, follows Associated Press style and normally capitalizes Black.)
“Black is a color,” said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the longtime civil rights leader who popularized the term “African American” in an effort to highlight the cultural heritage of those with ancestral ties to Africa. “We built the country through the African slave trade. African American acknowledges that. Any term that emphasizes the color and not the heritage separates us from our heritage.”
There are also concerns that turning black into a proper noun lumps people of the African diaspora into a monolithic group and erases the diversity of their experiences. Some have said it bestows credibility upon a social construct created to oppress Black people. Perhaps the most notable concern is what to do about white and brown as racial identifiers.
So far, most news organizations have declined to capitalize white, generally arguing that it is an identifier of skin color, not shared experience, and that white supremacist groups have adopted that convention.
But some scholars say that to write “Black” but not “White” is to give white people a pass on seeing themselves as a race and recognizing all the privileges they get from it.
“Whiteness is not incidental,” sociologist Eve Ewing wrote on Twitter in arguing to capitalize white as well. She added, “Whiteness is a thing. Whiteness is endowed with social meaning that allows people to move through the world in a way that people who are not white are not able to do.”
At a recent online meeting of Race/Related, a cross-desk team devoted to race coverage at the Times, a discussion of whether to capitalize black or not made clear that there is not universal agreement, even among African Americans on the staff.
“It has been the subject of a lively and surprising debate,” said Dean Baquet, the executive editor, who has indicated he will announce a decision on the issue soon.
The debate over racial vocabulary is unfolding amid growing recognition across society of the need to tackle racism after several high-profile police killings of Black people led to protests nationwide.
The acceptable terms in America for identifying Black people have evolved over generations, from colored to Negro to black and African American. Also commonly used is “people of color,” an umbrella term used to include many ethnic minorities.
In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, which has unleashed a national conversation on questions of race and racism, many say the country is long overdue to standardize the use of the uppercase B in black, which has been commonly used at Black media outlets for a long time.
The New York Amsterdam News, for instance, describes itself as “the oldest Black newspaper in the country that offers the ‘New Black View’ within local, national and international news for the Black community.”
The debate among Black people in America over how they should be described has often centered on identity as a political statement.
In her 1904 essay “Do We Need Another Name?” Fannie Barrier Williams, an educator and activist, described a lively discussion unfolding at the time among African American scholars over whether to shed the label Negro in favor of terms like colored or Afro-American. Colored, she wrote, was a “name that is suggestive of progress toward respectful recognition.”
At the heart of the discussion, she wrote, was whether African Americans needed a new label divorced from Negro and its connections to slavery, something of a fresh start that indicated their new place in society as free people.
Some, like W.E.B. Du Bois, favored keeping the term Negro and transforming it into something positive — an affirmation of their perseverance as a people and their freedom.
“There are so many Negroes who are not Negroes, so many colored people who are not colored, and so many Afro-Americans who are not Africans that it is simply impossible even to coin a term that will precisely designate and connote all the people who are now included under any one of the terms mentioned,” Barrier Williams wrote.
Negro became the predominant identifier of people of African descent for much of the first half of the 20th century. Even then, descendants of enslaved people from Africa waged a yearslong campaign before getting most of society, including the Times, to capitalize it.
With the rise of the Black Power movement in the mid-1960s, the word black, once seen as an insult for many African Americans, started winning embrace. In just a few years, it became the predominant descriptor of Black people as Negro became obsolete. Jackson’s campaign brought African American into popular use in the late 1980s, and it is now often used interchangeably with Black.
For proponents of capitalizing black, there are grammatical reasons: It is a proper noun referring to a specific group of people with a shared political identity shaped by colonialism and slavery. But some see it as a moral issue as well.
It confers a sense of power and respect to Black people, who have often been relegated to the lowest rungs of society through racist systems, Black scholars say.
“Race as a concept is not real in the biological sense, but it’s very real for our own identities,” said Whitney Pirtle, an assistant professor of sociology specializing in critical race theory at the University of California, Merced. “I think that capitalizing B both sort of puts respect to those identities but also alludes to the humanities.”
Vilna Bashi Treitler, a professor of Black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that racial categories were fabricated, created to denigrate people considered to be nonwhite. Black and white are adjectives, not proper nouns to be capitalized, she said, calling a term like “African descendant” a more appropriate way to characterize Black people.
“It’s a placeholder for describing the group of people who are perpetually reinserted into the bottom of the racial hierarchy,” Bashi Treitler, author of the book “The Ethnic Project,” said of the term black. “I think we can be more revolutionary than to embrace the oppressor’s term for us.”
In her first two books, Crystal M. Fleming, a sociologist and author, lowercased black in part because of academic differences between race and ethnicity. But the more she researched, the more those distinctions became blurred in her mind. She came to see race as a concept that could signify a politically and culturally meaningful identity.
Now Fleming, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and author of “How to be Less Stupid About Race,” is writing a book for young people about fighting racism. She has decided to use Black.
Part of the reason, she said, was her desire to honor Black experiences and speak with moral clarity about anti-racism. Another reason was more basic, born in the urgency of the current moment.
“Frankly,” she said, “because I want to. That’s also something that I think we need to see more of in every field — Black people doing what we want to do.”

Full text: Democrats' legislation would institute significant changes to the rules that govern how police officers operate, but it is doomed in the Republican-led Senate.
WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday passed an expansive policing overhaul bill aimed at combating racial discrimination and excessive use of force in law enforcement, as Democrats sought to respond to a nationwide outcry for racial justice and pushed through legislation that is doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate.
The bipartisan vote was 236-181 to approve the measure, the most sweeping federal intervention into law enforcement in years. It would eliminate legal protections that shield police officers from lawsuits, make it easier to prosecute them for wrongdoing, impose a new set of restrictions on the use of deadly force, and effectively ban the use of chokeholds.
But passage of the legislation, introduced as a response to the killings of black Americans across the country and a wave of protests that have followed, only underscored the depth of the stalemate in Congress over how to bring about law enforcement changes that both parties say are needed. Republicans have said the bill is a federal overreach into policing that will never pass the Senate, and the White House has threatened a veto.
Its approval came the day after Senate Democrats blocked a Republican effort to advance a much narrower bill that would encourage police departments to revise their practices, but not mandate any changes. That move all but extinguished the hope that Congress will be able to pass legislation this year addressing systemic racism in law enforcement, almost certainly shifting the debate over race and policing to the campaign trail, where the two parties will blame each other for the demise of the effort.
Still on Thursday, Democrats called the passage of their bill an important message at a time of upheaval over the treatment of black Americans by the police. Speaking from the Capitol steps, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that the vote would serve as a pledge to the American public: "Never again."
"Exactly one month ago, George Floyd spoke his final words, 'I can't breathe,' and changed the course of history," Ms. Pelosi said. "The House is honoring his life and the lives of all killed by police brutality."
Three moderate Republicans joined a united bloc of Democrats -- including those facing difficult re-election fights in conservative-leaning districts -- to support the legislation. The vote underscored just how quickly the politics of law enforcement have shifted during an election year amid a groundswell of public support for significant changes to the way that the police operate. Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Will Hurd of Texas, the only African-American Republican in the chamber, voted in support of the bill.
"With the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and far too many others, there was no doubt in my mind -- or that of most Americans -- that we needed to act," said Representative Max Rose, Democrat of New York. "Once again, we saw that black Americans, and other communities of color, are not equal in the eyes of too many criminal justice systems around the country. This bill has the potential to change that."
Democrats' legislation, spearheaded by Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, included several measures that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades, such as amending the federal criminal code to make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct by lowering the standard that prosecutors must meet.
Over 100 civil rights groups endorsed the legislation, as did some families of black Americans killed by the police, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after an officer put him in a chokehold, and Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot for carrying a toy gun.
"From banning chokeholds to eliminating no-knock warrants, this bill will hold officers accountable to the communities they serve and compel them to have a guardian mentality, not a warrior mentality," the families said in a statement. "In the valiant pursuit of justice, this is a strong step in the right direction."
The bill would also create a national registry to track police misconduct and require law enforcement agencies to report data on the use of force, aim to force departments to eliminate the use of chokeholds, and condition some federal grants on the adoption of anti-discrimination training and practices.
Law enforcement organizations and police unions forcefully opposed it, mounting a successful effort to dissuade the White House and Senate Republicans from embracing the most stringent requirements and restrictions.
Hours before the vote, the White House issued an official threat to veto the measure, calling it "overbroad" and arguing that it would "deter good people from pursuing careers in law enforcement" and "weaken the ability of law enforcement agencies to reduce crime."
Over two weeks ago, as protesters thronged streets in big cities and small towns across the nation, many lawmakers on Capitol Hill hoped that they would be able to bridge a previously insurmountable gulf on police reform efforts and pass legislation addressing systemic racism in law enforcement. Those hopes have rapidly fizzled, replaced by bitter recriminations after Senate Democrats refused on Wednesday even to allow the Republican bill to come up for debate, calling it "woefully inadequate."
The move left Republicans apoplectic and charging that Democrats had blocked the legislation for political gain. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters on Thursday that he had reached out to Democrats "explaining that I wanted to make law, I wanted to work together."
On the other side of the Capitol, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, chided Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, for his tone during the debate, charging that he had been disrespectful to Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sponsor of the Republican bill and the only black senator in the party.
"I didn't see why the Democratic leader talks right past Senator Scott as if he were not leading this discussion, as if he were barely here," Mr. McConnell said on the floor. "All I can say is that it was jarring to witness."
In fact in his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer called Mr. Scott "greatly respected" and asked Mr. McConnell to have the South Carolina Republican lead a bipartisan effort to negotiate a new, more expansive Senate policing bill. Republicans rejected that entreaty, and Democrats moved to block their bill.
Ms. Pelosi endorsed the decision to block the Republican bill, saying it did not contain "anything they could vote for."
"You all gave them so much credit for a bill that did nothing and then expected us to embrace it," she told reporters. "No way. They did the right thing."
Both Republicans and Democrats have insisted that the opportunity to revive policing reform efforts has not been foreclosed. But given the partisan gridlock, and with lawmakers in both chambers expected to be out of Washington for extended periods of time leading up to the November election, many of them privately concede that a compromise will be difficult to strike.

LOS ANGELES — So long, Splash Mountain.
Disney said Thursday that it would remake one of its most popular theme park rides, Splash Mountain, which depicts characters and songs from “Song of the South,” the racist 1946 musical. The 31-year-old flume ride will instead be modeled on “The Princess and the Frog,” the 2009 musical that introduced Disney’s first black princess, Tiana.
The name Splash Mountain will also be retired. New Adventures With Princess Tiana is the working title of the coming attraction, which will be set in the Louisiana bayou.
“It is important that our guests be able to see themselves in the experiences we create,” Carmen Smith, vice president of creative development and inclusion strategies at Walt Disney Imagineering, said in a blog post. Imagineering is Disney’s research and design division.
The overhaul at both Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California, the theme parks that feature the ride, will easily cost tens of millions of dollars.
Disney is expunging the “Song of the South” imagery — Br’er Rabbit and other animal minstrels — during a national reckoning on racial justice. Protests against police brutality and racism, sparked by the killing of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis, have prompted a wide spectrum of companies to make long-overdue changes. Quaker Oats, for instance, said it would retire Aunt Jemima, a 131-year-old brand built on racist imagery.
In the case of Splash Mountain, Disney executives had privately discussed abandoning the “Song of the South” theming for at least five years. Last summer, Disney said, a plan was put into motion to give the ride a “Princess and the Frog” story line. Bob Weis, president of Walt Disney Imagineering, commissioned concept art. Disney said it had sped up the public unveiling of the project because of the current cultural conversation about race.
“It has been a year or more since we started talking about this particular concept,” Weis said in an interview posted on D23.com, a fan site run by Disney.
In recent weeks, online petitions began to circulate about Splash Mountain. More than 21,300 people signed one asking Disney to remove the ride’s “offensive stereotypical theming.” About 26,300 people have signed a dueling Change.org petition demanding that Disney keep the “iconic classic ride” as it is.
Sparring over a theme park ride may seem silly, especially against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which is surging again. But Disney is a huge part of how many people live their lives — how they make their memories — and even the smallest changes to the company’s theme parks can spark outrage. For the same reason, the addition of a major attraction themed around a black heroine could have a positive impact on young visitors, in particular those of color.
Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella have castles. The Little Mermaid and the “Frozen” sisters have rides. Why not also Tiana?
“The Princess and the Frog” tells the story of a young black woman who is persuaded to kiss a frog who is really a prince. The spell backfires, and she, too, becomes an amphibian. Accompanied by a Cajun firefly and a folksy alligator, she searches for a cure.
Like other modern Disney princesses, Tiana is a strong-willed songbird (courtesy of the Tony-winning Anika Noni Rose). The tale unfolds against a raucous backdrop of voodoo and jazz, with Oprah Winfrey and Jenifer Lewis voicing supporting characters.
The movie received strong reviews and was nominated for three Oscars. But ticket sales were underwhelming, in part because children reared on Pixar’s computer wizardry had a hard time connecting with the film’s hand-drawn animation. “The Princess and the Frog” collected about $257 million worldwide, or $324 million in today’s dollars.
Since its release, “The Princess and the Frog” has become a merchandising star for Disney, with Tiana princess dresses for young girls selling particularly well.
Disney has not made “Song of the South” available in any form for 33 years because of its racist imagery. Splash Mountain does not overtly reference the film, but the ride is built around the Br’er Rabbit and Br’er Fox stories that form its center. The ride also features the Oscar-winning song from the film, “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.”
Disney has updated other rides over the years to make them more relevant to children and to remove outdated imagery. In 2017, for instance, a bride auction and a scene where scofflaws chase women through a house were removed from Pirates of the Caribbean. Also that year, Disney closed the popular Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, a hotel with wildly malfunctioning elevators, and turned it into a new ride based on Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy.”
At least for now, one Splash Mountain will survive: The ride is also at Tokyo Disneyland, which Disney doesn’t own. (The company licenses its characters and products to the Oriental Land Co.) There are no plans to give that one a “Princess and the Frog” makeover, a spokeswoman said.

NEW YORK — No spring sports. No long-awaited trips abroad or senior spirit week. Proms delayed indefinitely, and graduations switched to Zoom.
Seniors at New York City high schools have spent the past few months watching as the semester they had anticipated for four years evaporated in just a few weeks.
Despite what they had lost, newspaper and yearbook editors at two schools — Townsend Harris High School in Queens and Curtis High School on Staten Island — had to keep moving.
There was work to do. Since March, they have scrambled to document as much of their lost semester as possible.
“Everything is on pause, but not us,” said Amanda Renzi, an editor of the Townsend Harris paper, The Classic.
Faculty advisers at Townsend Harris and Curtis, acutely aware that high school papers across New York City have been dying out, have long urged their students to produce robust and consequential journalism. For the past few months, they got an unlucky opportunity to do just that.
They have become indispensable beacons of information about canceled events and lost milestones as the coronavirus ravaged New York City. They have tried to make sense of, and cover, a completely disrupted high school experience that has included teachers getting sick and dying, family members losing jobs, and relatives and close friends battling the virus on the front lines.
Yearbooks and student newspapers have always defined these students’ high school lives, but never more so than during the pandemic, when writing, editing and designing gave them structure and purpose as uncertainty swirled.
By late June, even after the Zoom graduations had concluded, the students, soon to enter college, were still busy.
They still had yearbooks to distribute, a few more articles to publish and new crop of editors to recruit and train who themselves face an unknown, and possibly virtual, fall semester.
Curtis High School: North Shore, Staten Island
April 3 to 18.
Those were the foreign exchange program dates that Cheyanne Richardson had kept circled for months. She had bought gifts in preparation for her planned stay in Milan. She and her father had dreamed about visiting Italy together before he died a few years ago, and the high school trip would have been her first out of the country.
But then …
“It’s my senior year,” she said, choking up. “I can’t do this again.”
The exchange program was one of many milestones that vanished. Lacrosse, softball and all the other spring sports, gone. The spring musical, “Legally Blonde,” and dance show, gone as well.
Yet Cheyanne and other editors had little time to process their collective loss. As the stewards of the school’s yearbook and newspaper, both endeavors of the journalism program, they had to cover the crisis that was upending their last semester of high school.
It was a daunting pivot, especially with everyone in quarantine. But one by one, students began contacting the editors, said Nadia Chin, another editor, with questions like, “Are you guys still doing yearbook? Am I in the yearbook? Do I need to do anything?”
Yes, everyone agreed, the yearbook had to be done.
“Our job is to make memories for everyone,” Nadia said, “and if everyone is not included, then what’s the point?”
Curtis, near the St. George Ferry Terminal, is Staten Island’s oldest high school. It offers an international baccalaureate program and career tracks like nursing for a diverse, immigrant-heavy student body of 2,500, three-quarters of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.
Cadence Turner oversees the journalism program. A 1985 Curtis graduate, Turner is one of about two dozen alumni who now teach or work at the sports-crazed school, whose graduates include baseball legend Bobby Thomson. She is also the soccer coach and a Curtis parent. Her son, David Garvin, the senior class president, will play soccer for Skidmore in the fall — if there is a fall.
Even before the pandemic, editors had talked about the poignancy of this school year. As members of the first high school class born after the Sept. 11 attacks to graduate, they have grown up in a world shaped by school shootings, climate change and racial divisions.
Their sense of urgency intensified in April when Turner began setting up Google meetings at least twice a week with journalism students and even more regularly with Nadia; Cheyanne; Greer Gerney, the only junior; and other top editors.
With as many as 22 people on some calls, the students were determined to work first on the yearbook, which is more like a magazine, with longer, reported articles.
Nadia said that one usual feature, “A Day in the Life” of a typical Curtis senior, should be revised to reflect “A Day in the Life of Quarantine.”
“Every day is important,” Nadia said.
One student suggested an article on the dress code for virtual learning.
Another suggested one on how students had celebrated their 18th birthday in quarantine.
Yet another proposed something about the first time a Curtis senior gave blood.
“The camaraderie in the class — I just miss it so much,” Turner told the students. “When I sit down and do work by myself, it really sucks, but unfortunately that’s the way it is.”
The student newspaper, The Curtis Log, is normally printed every month or so and distributed at the school. The switch to online publishing presented logistical hurdles.
“Some people who have been writing for us before are not quite as involved because they don’t check their email,” Greer said during one call.
The students wrote about sports and the musical being canceled as well as the unexpected death of an ROTC instructor. Nothing made as big an impact as an article on Ed Latourette, a history teacher who died of COVID-19, according to a GoFundMe page his family established. Most Curtis Log articles do not get comments, but 37 students, teachers and alumni paid tribute to Latourette.
One example: “Wow, I’m at a loss for words. He put up with me my freshman and sophomore year. He passed me and saw potential in me.”
Even as the school year wound down, the student journalists met regularly, with plans to publish articles over the summer to keep the Curtis community informed.
One article might focus on the killing of George Floyd and note that Eric Garner was also killed in an altercation with police not far from the school, and that one of his children attended Curtis. Another might report on immigrant students at Curtis who are living in the country illegally, or students with relatives living in the country illegally, and the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.
At times, the student journalists, with their own plans for the fall uncertain, said they felt as isolated and exhausted as their peers. In late May, Turner invited Curtis alumni who had worked on the yearbook and newspaper to a virtual party with the current students. More than 40 people attended, with former students offering congratulations and advice.
“I’m sure a lot of things that were planned for this year were thrown out the window and had to be reinvented at the last moment,” said one graduate, Cana Sarnes, who is now a photographer. “But that will stand out as being even a little better because you had to be creative.”
Townsend Harris High School: Kew Gardens, Queens
“Is everyone doing OK?”
Samantha Alzate, an editor at The Classic, was met with nervous laughter from the paper’s writing staff when she kicked off a Zoom meeting with a greeting that once would have been innocuous but has become one of the most loaded questions of the pandemic.
Propped up on her bed and wrapped in a white blanket on a chilly April morning, with Christmas lights strung in the background, Samantha spent a few minutes ticking off the ways the group could try to re-create some of what they were missing with each passing day.
Spring at Townsend Harris, one of the city’s most academically rigorous schools, brings college acceptance season and, with it, the annual college video. For years, students have come to school on a specific day decked out in the gear of the college they have committed to; and Classic editors film hundreds of seniors dancing, high-fiving and embracing.
This year, the paper had to improvise. Over the past two months, editors virtually recorded and edited dozens of TikToks of seniors revealing their college choices.
Every Friday morning since late March, those responsible for the video met online and went over every piece of minutiae they could control to make the video feel special.
Students occasionally called in to the 11 a.m. Zoom meeting a few minutes late, from bed, having just woken up after a late night of working on the video.
All the meticulous planning, Samantha said, “makes me feel like I never left school.”
When Usha Sookai, the arts editor, took on the responsibility for trying to re-create senior events online, she quickly realized how much she and her classmates would never get to experience.
“You have to come to terms with what you’re not going to get,” she said, “and think of ways to fulfill that desire and meaning without being able to do it.”
That message has resonated for the editors at Townsend Harris, a fiercely independent school.
In 2017, students, many of whom live in Queens and are first- or second-generation immigrants, staged mass sit-ins that helped oust the school’s principal at the time. The Classic, which played a major role in the revolt, is one of the new student newspapers in the city that boasts a free press charter, which ensures that school administrators cannot review articles before publication.
The virus has given The Classic a moment to flex its journalistic muscles.
Every year, the paper runs a series called Introducing, which features Townsend Harris seniors reflecting on their years at the school. This year, in addition to seniors offering advice to their younger selves, Introducing included stories about essential workers who are related to Townsend students.
In March, shortly before Mayor Bill de Blasio closed the city’s schools, the Classic team spent a weekend pulling together what Samantha called a “pretty awesome” public records request seeking information from the Department of Education about how many students had been sent home sick from school earlier in the month.
In between their online classes, the staff, with help from student government representatives, updated an Instagram page where students submitted photos of themselves in plaid frocks and oversize T-shirts for a virtual pajama day.
On graduation day, The Classic posted a story showing dozens of decorated mortarboard caps, arranged in alphabetical order as they would have been at a traditional ceremony. The headline: “The class of 2020 shares caps with pomp, despite the circumstances.”
The editors who oversaw all that work were constantly rallying their staff and pushing for as joyful a crescendo to their frustrating year as possible.
Off camera, they oscillated between determination and weariness.
Isabelle Guillaume, the paper’s third editor-in-chief, worried about her mother, who had been so excited to watch Isabelle and her sister, a college senior, graduate this year.
Samantha sometimes paused at her closet to admire the prom dress she bought the day before schools were closed and, unless the event happens late this summer, may never wear.
And Amanda, who, like many of her classmates, had spent much of her time at Townsend Harris studying, had seen the end of senior year as a well-earned respite.
“I felt like this was finally going to be, us, free, going out into the world,” she said one April afternoon. “Now it just feels like it’s ruined.”
But by June, the three teenagers were buoyed by the fact they had preserved at least some traditions they had feared they would lose altogether.
Isabelle remembered that horrible day in March when schools were closed and thought about how much had changed.
“I thought, wow, my second semester has really gone downhill, and I’m not going to get it back,” she said. “But the work we’ve been doing has affirmed that I have a purpose here.”

NEW YORK — In early March, Wynton Marsalis, the trumpeter and composer, went into pandemic lockdown with a preconceived notion of all he might accomplish. “I thought that I would be able to practice a lot, exercise a lot and eat less, write a lot of music,” he said.
But as the managing and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, Marsalis had an arts organization to keep afloat. Then on April 1, his father and “North Star,” jazz pianist and educator Ellis Marsalis Jr., died of complications from COVID-19.
So Marsalis shifted into overdrive — helping to develop Jazz at Lincoln Center’s online content, like the weekly conversation “Skain’s Domain,” orchestral collaborations like “Quarantine Blues” and even a virtual edition of its high school jazz band competition, Essentially Ellington. He also wrote a moving tribute to his father and a powerful statement about segregation and the killing of George Floyd, and has plans to release a new album, “The Ever Fonky Lowdown,” soon. “It’s about the hustle that’s being run on Black and white folks,” he said.
All of which has waylaid Marsalis’ original plan. But it has not stopped him from being consumed by the state of the world. In a phone conversation from his home in Manhattan, he elaborated on 10 things that have been on his mind and have kept him going through difficult times.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
1. Jazz as a Metaphor for Democracy
The first concept of individual freedom is improvisation. We give you more credit for improvising your own perspective, not to imitate or be part of some plan. The second is swinging, which is the opposite of improvisation. It means that you are challenged to find balance with other people, to balance yourself in their time.
But the difference is, we practice democracy in the way of a bunch of self-interested groups, battling for supremacy. In our music, the objective is to maintain your self-interest, but to understand that the momentum of the group is in your best self-interest. So it would be like if we were actually challenged to make life easier for our neighbors and for people who are not like us, like the drummer’s job is to play with the bass player — not to say: “Well, I play the loudest. Let me figure out how to play over this bass player or make them play in my time.”
2. The Blues
The fundamental form in all American music — that’s what the blues is. It’s in every folk song, gospel song, the sound of the banjo and the sound of the guitar. It’s in the sound of ragtime, it’s in the sound of John Philip Sousa’s marches. It’s hard to get the blues out of your sound.
Blues is also call and response, which is a democratic form. It generally has lyrics that describe something tragic or sad. But many times it reverses that and gives you something that’s hopeful. The thing about “Quarantine Blues” that was so interesting is everyone wrote it and everyone arranged it. And we all wrote different things. There was not one emotion assigned to it.
3. “Skain’s Domain” Conversations
We’ve reinvented ourselves online. The idea of doing “Skain’s Domain” came out of that experience of telling stories and keeping our community connected, and me having a chance to answer questions people may have.
You know, I always have met with people after every concert. I try to be the last one in the concert hall, and that’s been 40 years of that. People of all ages come on [“Skain’s Domain”], and I try and be as genuine in talking to them as directly as I would do if it were live.
4. His Father
Sometimes you have a really good relationship with one of your parents where it’s not something you can explain. And for me, it was like that. It’s deeper than love. It’s like an interest and an identification.
My father was real gentle as a person. He was much more like an intellectual. He taught a lot of people and loved his students, and a lot of people loved him. He had a good spirit and heart, and he was a humanist, so he always had a very broad-minded view. And he was happy for people who did great things. It didn’t matter who it was. It could be me, Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison, Harry Connick Jr.
Everybody has a different relationship to the people that they mourn. We all digest our lives in different ways. The only thing I would tell people is just to be patient and try to come to your feelings without any judgment of them — even if it’s not to have feelings at all. That was one of my father’s crazy things. He’d always say, “Man, don’t feel like you got to make yourself feel any way.” He accepted this life as what it is.
5. Justice for George Floyd
I wrote that it’s more difficult to draw a crowd every day for the sanctioned and accepted forms of corruption and disrespect of Black Americans that are shouted from countless recordings and videos — and even more powerfully whispered in the form of discriminatory laws, practices and procedures that result in unfair housing and employment practices and more tragically, lengthy, unjust prison sentences. And I should have said, even to death. So that summarizes how I feel about all of it. And have always felt, and have always said.
In the sense of this specific killing, there are things that we can do to correct that. Are we going to do those things? The Supreme Court just made a judgment about [workplace] discrimination and people’s sexuality. I agree with that 1,000%. Qualified immunity is one of the linchpins in police violence. And under the radar, they decided not to hear that. They left it up to the locals. The highest court in the land, symbolically, needs to say, “We’re going to put an end to this.”
6. The Beauty of Jazz
Duke Ellington, just the way he dressed and spoke. He grew up in a minstrel era, the whole kind of Stepin Fetchit mode. He was the opposite of that. Louis Armstrong, just the brilliance of his genius taught the entire world how to play and refuted the stereotypes of Black people in his time. Benny Goodman put his life on the line to present an integrated band in 1936. Dave Brubeck had the first integrated band in the U.S. military. I’m just giving you a few. There are many more.
This is a great time for our mission [at Jazz at Lincoln Center]. We don’t have to change anything. Our mantra from our beginning was: “No segregation. No generation gap. And all of our music is modern.”
7. Essentially Ellington
I’m proud of all my alumni, the band directors, the level people are playing on. Just this year alone we had “25 Years, 25 Solos,” which was great to hear how kids played across time. For me, it’s been an honor every single year to work with the judges and to hear kids play and participate in their development.
8. Real Solutions
We form a collective voice around interests, but propaganda gets in the way of our actual interests. We need to attack, from a community standpoint, substantive issues. One is our lower-class economic infrastructure. What if we considered it an achievement to put our brainpower on doing that? How long do you think it will take us to figure that out? What about figuring out how to have universal health care that’s not connected to people’s jobs? What about education? We need to have big solutions to problems that will make us be a greater nation. And it is mind boggling how a nation with this kind of wealth can be this stingy about investing in the civic part of their civilization and culture. Those are life essentials.
9. Frederick Douglass and William Butler Yeats
I just read David Blight’s [“Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom”]. It’s a fantastic book. Me and my father were reading it together, and I said, “Do you want me to tell you about the end of it?” And he said, “No, man, no. …” I actually met with David Blight. I absolutely love him. Just to have a chance to sit with David and talk about Frederick Douglass’ life and the 1850s with that kind of clarity.
And William Butler Yeats. That’s my man. I’ve read his poetry for years. I read it on the road. I read it to catch a bus. His worldview is a lot like my father’s — very grounded in an Eastern, spiritual overview. “Sailing to Byzantium” is a good poem for this time: “An aged man is but a paltry thing/ A tattered coat upon a stick.” Yeats, he transcends.
10. My Colleagues
It has been an absolute blessing to work with my people. I can’t say that enough. Like, what I learned about my colleagues and what they were willing to do to climb up the mountain. Every day we have a management meeting. Twice a week we have a staff meeting. Once a week we meet with the orchestra. The way everybody has worked together has been one of the most enlightening, uplifting things for me in my entire life.

Insurgent Wave Upends House Primaries in N.Y. as Engel Falls Behind [With graphic(s)]

Candidates from the Democratic Party’s left wing held significant leads in three marquee House primaries in New York after Tuesday’s machine ballot count, in a profound show of progressive political power.
One of the contests could lead to the unseating of an entrenched leader: Rep. Eliot L. Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was badly trailing Jamaal Bowman, an insurgent candidate from Yonkers.
If Engel, who has served in Congress for more than 30 years, were to lose, it would echo a similar upset in 2018, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Joseph Crowley, then the No. 4 House Democrat.
But this year, the movement seemed to have more reach, as progressive Democrats led the way in contests for two open House seats held by retiring Democrats.
In the Bronx, Ritchie Torres, a city councilman, led a pack of contenders in the 15th Congressional District, where Rep. José E. Serrano is retiring. Those trailing Torres included a political veteran, Rubén Díaz Sr., a conservative former state senator with a history of anti-gay remarks, who had been considered among the favorites.
And in the Hudson Valley district held by Rep. Nita Lowey, who is also retiring, Mondaire Jones, a Harvard-educated lawyer, had pulled away from six other candidates in early returns.
Jones and Torres would become trailblazers if elected in November: Either would be the first openly gay Black member of Congress.
All of Tuesday’s results came with a sizable caveat: State officials had issued nearly 2 million absentee ballots to voters statewide because of the coronavirus outbreak, and those votes — which could be postmarked as late as Primary Day — would not be fully counted for at least a week.
That means close races may stay in limbo till July. One such contest involves another veteran Democratic incumbent, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who had a slight lead over Suraj Patel, who ran against her in 2018.
Still, early returns seemed to confirm that the liberal wave that elected Ocasio-Cortez to Congress in 2018 has continued to build momentum.
Ocasio-Cortez had faced a primary challenge herself but swept it aside easily, even as like-minded candidates — embracing her call for a Green New Deal and “Medicare for All,” among other policies — showed electoral muscle.
That strength was perhaps most evident in the 16th Congressional District, which includes parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, and where Bowman had a hefty lead over Engel, who was first elected there in 1988.
The race there had illustrated the sharp schism in Democratic ranks, with Bowman backed by many of the Democrats’ most outspoken progressives and Engel, fighting for his political life, seeking rescue from more centrist party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Bowman, a middle-school principal, declared victory Wednesday morning, though The Associated Press had yet to call the race.
In a speech to supporters Tuesday night, he spoke out against poverty, racism and sexism, among other social ills, “a system that’s literally killing us.” He said, if elected, he would be a “Black man with power.”
“That is what Donald Trump is afraid of,” said Bowman, adding: “I cannot wait to get to Congress and cause problems.”
In a statement, the Engel campaign said “any declarative statement on the outcome of this race right now is premature,” and called for every vote to be counted.
Establishment Democrats could take some solace in easy wins for a number of incumbents, including Rep. Gregory Meeks, the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, held a comfortable lead over two challengers, and Rep. Yvette Clarke was also leading in her race in Brooklyn, though — as elsewhere — thousands of absentee votes remained to be counted.
Indeed, the sheer number of absentee ballots could prove daunting to election officials, especially considering the battles over vote counts even before the coronavirus, like last year’s contested election for district attorney in Queens.
Martin Connor, an election lawyer and former state senator, said the pandemic would present daunting logistical issues for the New York City Board of Elections. The board would need to ensure social distancing during the counting process, while allowing campaigns to have representatives — or watchers — present to oversee the vote counts.
“It’s an extraordinary number of absentee ballots,” he said. “And we’ve never had this in the history of this state.”
Though more than 700,000 voters in New York City were sent absentee ballots, not all of them are expected to be returned. Many voters might not have received them in time, might have failed to mail them in, or might have voted in person instead.
So far, the city’s Board of Elections had received about 12% of the absentee ballots that were mailed out, according to preliminary data.
Matt Rey, a partner at Red Horse Strategies, a political consulting firm that has been analyzing the demographics of voters who applied for absentee ballots, said there was nothing in the data to suggest Bowman, Jones and Torres were at risk of losing their leads.
“The breadth of their victories is the real highlight for me here,” said Rey, whose firm worked with a candidate, Assemblyman David Buchwald, who ran against Jones in the 17th District. “They’re rightly confident to declare victory.”
Rey noted an overwhelming number of voters who requested absentee ballots in competitive districts were under age 40, a demographic that could give challengers an edge.
The progressive surge in congressional races also played out in many down-ballot legislative races, especially in state Assembly races in Queens, where several incumbents appeared endangered.
In Jackson Heights, Jessica González-Rojas, a Latina community organizer who drew many parallels to Ocasio-Cortez, was leading a crowded race to defeat Assemblyman Michael DenDekker, a six-term Democrat. In Astoria, Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, was beating Aravella Simotas, an assemblywoman from Astoria since 2011.
In Westchester County, two assemblymen, Steven Otis and Thomas J. Abinanti, were also trailing their opponents.
The big night for progressives was hailed by liberal groups like the Working Families Party and political action committees like Justice Democrats, which had jointly spent more than $1 million on Bowman’s behalf. On Wednesday, the two groups were declaring victory, and sending warning signals, to more mainstream Democrats, including the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden.
“The future of the Democratic Party looks a lot more like A.O.C. and Jamaal than Joe Biden,” said Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the Justice Democrats. “Biden knows that if he enters the White House in 2021, he won’t be governing with the same Congress from 2009.”
Like Bowman and Torres, Jones had campaigned on civil rights and criminal justice issues, seizing on the energy inside the Black Lives Matter movement after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Jones, a lawyer supported by the institutional left and many national progressive leaders, had garnered more than twice the votes of his nearest rival, Adam Schleifer, a former federal prosecutor and the son of a pharmaceutical billionaire who had outspent Jones by more than 5-to-1. Jones, however, benefited from some independent expenditures on his behalf, including by the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
If he wins the Democratic nomination and the general election in November, Jones would fill the seat held by Lowey, 82, who announced her impending retirement in October in the face of a possible primary challenge from Jones. A first-time candidate and an avowed science-fiction fan, Jones likened the race to “a story out of a sci-fi novel,” he said.
Which sci-fi novel, he was asked?
“One that is still being written,” he said.

Joe Biden has taken a commanding lead over President Donald Trump in the 2020 race, building a wide advantage among women and nonwhite voters and making deep inroads with some traditionally Republican-leaning groups that have shifted away from Trump following his ineffective response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new national poll of registered voters by The New York Times and Siena College.
Biden is currently ahead of Trump by 14 percentage points, garnering 50% of the vote compared with 36% for Trump. That is among the most dismal showings of Trump’s presidency, and a sign that he is the clear underdog right now in his fight for a second term.
Trump has been an unpopular president for virtually his entire time in office. He has made few efforts since his election in 2016 to broaden his support beyond the right-wing base that vaulted him into office with only 46%of the popular vote and a modest victory in the Electoral College.
But among a striking cross-section of voters, the distaste for Trump has deepened as his administration failed to stop a deadly disease that crippled the economy and then as he responded to a wave of racial-justice protests with angry bluster and militaristic threats. The dominant picture that emerges from the poll is of a country ready to reject a president whom a strong majority of voters regard as failing the greatest tests confronting his administration.
Biden leads Trump by enormous margins with black and Hispanic voters, and women and young people appear on track to choose Biden by an even wider margin than they favored Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. But the former vice president has also drawn even with Trump among male voters, whites and people in middle age and older — groups that have typically been the backbones of Republican electoral success, including Trump’s in 2016.
Arlene Myles, 75, of Denver, said she had been a Republican for nearly six decades before switching her registration to independent earlier this year during Trump’s impeachment trial. Myles said that when Trump was first elected, she had resolved to “give him a chance,” but had since concluded that he and his party were irredeemable.
“I was one of those people who stuck by Nixon until he was waving goodbye,” Myles said. “I thought I was a good Republican and thought they had my values, but they have gone down the tubes these last few years.”
Myles said she planned to vote for Biden, expressing only one misgiving: “I wish he was younger,” she said.
Most stark may be Biden’s towering advantage among white women with college degrees, who support him over Trump by 39 percentage points. In 2016, exit polls found that group preferred Clinton to Trump by just 7 percentage points. The poll also found that Biden has narrowed Trump’s advantage with less-educated white voters.
The exodus of white voters from the GOP has been especially pronounced among younger voters, an ominous trend for a party that was already heavily reliant on older Americans.
Fifty-two percent of whites under 45 said they supported Biden while only 30% said they supported Trump. And their opposition is intense: More than twice as many younger whites viewed the president very unfavorably than very favorably.
Tom Diamond, 31, a Republican in Fort Worth, Texas, said he planned to vote for Trump but would do so with real misgivings. He called the president a “poor leader” who had mishandled the pandemic and said Biden seemed “like a guy you can trust.” But Trump held views closer to his own on the economy, health care and abortion.
“Part of you just feels icky voting for him,” Diamond said. “But definitely from a policy perspective, that’s where my vote’s going to go.”
Some unease toward Trump stems from voters’ racial attitudes. According to the poll, white voters under 45 are overwhelmingly supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement, while older whites are more tepid in their views toward racial justice activism. And nearly 70% of whites under 45 said they believed the killing of George Floyd was part of a broader pattern of excessive police violence toward African Americans rather than an isolated incident.
What’s striking, though, is that even among white seniors, one of Trump’s strongest constituencies, he has damaged himself with his conduct. About two-fifths of whites over 65 said they disapproved of Trump’s handling of both the coronavirus and race relations.
Trump retains a few points of strength in the poll that could offer him a way to regain a footing in the race, and the feeble condition of his candidacy right now may well represent his low point in a campaign with 4 1/2 months still to go.
His approval rating is still narrowly positive on the issue of the economy, with 50% of voters giving him favorable marks compared with 45% saying the opposite. Should the fall campaign become a referendum on which candidate is better equipped to restore prosperity after the pandemic has subsided, that could give Trump a new opening to press his case.
The president is also still ahead of Biden among white voters without college degrees, who hold disproportionate influence in presidential elections because of how central the Midwest is to capturing 270 electoral votes.
Yet if Trump still has a significant measure of credibility with voters on the economy, he lacks any apparent political strength on the most urgent issues of the moment: the pandemic and the national reckoning on policing and race.
Nearly three-fifths of voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, including majorities of white voters and men. Self-described moderate voters disapproved of Trump on the coronavirus by a margin of more than 2-1.
Most of the country is also rejecting Trump’s call to reopen the economy as quickly as possible, even at the cost of exposing people to greater health risks. By a 21-point margin, voters said the federal government should prioritize containing the coronavirus, even if it hurts the economy, a view that aligns them with Biden.
Just a third of voters said the government should focus on restarting the economy even if that entails greater public-health risks.
That debate could become the central focus of the campaign in the coming weeks, as coronavirus outbreaks grow rapidly in a number of Republican-led states that have resisted the strict lockdown measures imposed in the spring by Democratic states like New York and California.
The public also does not share Trump’s resistance to mask wearing. The president has declined to don a mask in nearly all public appearances, even as top health officials in his administration have urged Americans to do so as a precaution against spreading the coronavirus. In the poll, 54% of people said they always wear a mask when they expect to be in proximity to other people, while another 22% said they usually wear a mask.
Just 22% said they rarely or never wear a mask.
Trump’s job approval on race relations was just as dismal. Sixty-one percent of voters said they disapproved of Trump’s handling of race, versus 33% who said they approved. By a similar margin, voters said they disapproved of his response to the protests after the death of Floyd.
Trump has sought several times in the last month to use demonstrations against the police as a political wedge issue, forcing Democrats to align themselves squarely either with law-enforcement agencies or with the most strident anti-police demonstrators.
The poll suggested most voters were rejecting that binary choice, as well as Trump’s harsh characterization of protesters: Large majorities said they had a positive overall assessment of both the Black Lives Matter movement and the police.
The picture of Biden that emerges from the poll is one of a broadly acceptable candidate who inspires relatively few strong feelings in either direction. He is seen favorably by about half of voters and unfavorably by 42%. Only a quarter said they saw him very favorably, equaling the share that sees him in very negative terms.
Trump, by contrast, is seen very favorably by 27% of voters and very unfavorably by 50%.
Harry Hoyt, 72, of York County in Southern Maine, said he has sometimes voted for Republican presidential candidates in the past and cast a grudging vote for Clinton in 2016. He felt better this time about his plan to vote for Biden.
“Biden would be a better candidate than Trump, simply because he’s a nice person,” Hoyt said. “One of the most important things to me is the character of the man in charge of our country.”
Significantly, one group that saw Biden as far more than just acceptable was black voters. Fifty-six percent of black respondents in the poll said they saw Biden very favorably, a far more enthusiastic judgment than from any other constituency.
The limited passion for Biden among other Democratic constituencies does not appear to be affecting his position against Trump. Though only 13% of people under 30 said they had a very favorable opinion of the former vice president, that group is backing Biden over Trump by 34 percentage points.
Nicholas Angelos, a 20-year-old voter in Bloomington, Indiana, who said he supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries, said he would vote for Biden as the “lesser of two evils.” He said he believed the former vice president would “try his best,” in contrast to Trump, whom he described as “an autocrat” and “anti-science.”
“We all have to compromise,” said Angelos, who described himself as very liberal. He added of Biden, “I don’t think he’s anything special.”
For the moment, voters also appear unpersuaded by one of the primary attack lines Trump and his party have used against Biden: the claim that, at age 77, he is simply too old for the presidency. Trump, 74, has mocked Biden’s mental acuity frequently over the last few months and his campaign has run television advertisements that cast Biden as absent-minded and inarticulate.
But three in five voters said in the poll that they disagreed with the claim that Biden was too old to be an effective president. The percentage of voters who agreed, 36%, exactly matched Trump’s existing support in the presidential race.
Lindsay Clark, 37, who lives in the suburbs of Salt Lake City, was among the voters who said she would probably vote for Trump because she was unsure Biden was “physically and mentally up to the task” of being president. But Clark expressed little admiration for Trump, whom she called unpresidential.
Clark, who voted for a third-party candidate in 2016, said she was hard-pressed to name something she really liked about Trump, eventually settling on the idea that he expressed himself bluntly.
“I was just trying to think if I could think of something off the top of my head that I was like, ‘Yes, I loved when you did that!’” she said of Trump. “And I kind of just can’t.”

NEW YORK — Some sights are so searing that you can’t unsee them. And, like it or not, you end up seeing the world through them. Reality hasn’t changed; you have, which makes you want to change reality. Right now.
That pretty much describes the cause-and-effect physics surrounding the release, on May 25, of the cellphone video of George Floyd pinned to the ground and having the life squeezed out of him, second by second, by a Minneapolis policeman.
In the protests that followed, white supremacist images of all kinds — Confederate memorials, statues of slave-owners, tributes to colonizers — have come under attack. Some have been destroyed; others forklifted into storage; still others left in place to await an uncertain fate.
More recently, the anti-monument movement appears to be spreading beyond a focused demand for racial justice. Earlier this week in Madison, Wisconsin, protesters toppled a statue of Hans Christian Heg, an abolitionist who died trying to end slavery.
Among a number of racially charged images in New York City, one of the most contested, the equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt at the entrance the American Museum of Natural History, has finally had its day of reckoning. Last week the museum itself asked the city for permission to remove the statue, and got the OK.
In a press statement, the museum was careful to explain the reason behind its request for removal. Roosevelt himself — whose father was a founder of the museum — was not the main problem. The monument’s optics were.
Roosevelt is a complicated historical figure, an unstable ethical compound of bad and good. As an ardent conservationist, he put vast stretches of American land under federal protection, but took much of that land from Native Americans. He was internationalist in his thinking, but largely because he considered the resources of the world, particularly parts of the world with dark-skinned populations, to be ripe for the taking.
A Smithsonian Institution website describes him bluntly as “a racist whose beliefs reflected those of the elite of his day. Roosevelt thought African Americans to be inferior to white citizens.”
But even if you didn’t know any of this, one look at the monument tells you that it’s a problem, one that no extenuating information can make right.
Twenty-four feet tall, including an 8-foot high base, the 1940 sculpture by James Earle Fraser depicts Roosevelt, armed with pistols and perched on a spirited charger. Below him, walking on either side of the horse, their heads reaching barely higher than its back, are two other male figures, one Native American, one African, both in “native” attire. Each carries a rifle. Are they meant to be Roosevelt’s gun-bearers? His guides? His security detail? Whatever, he doesn’t look like he needs them. His face is alert, resolute, forward-directed; theirs, passive, withdrawn, cast down.
The image is, of course, a fantasy, one that can, and has been, interpreted in varying ways. One historian reads the standing figures as allegorical embodiments of Africa and America. To Fraser himself they represented “Roosevelt’s friendliness to all races.” But to contemporary eyes, the white supremacist import of its composition is unmistakable, and unacceptable: heroic white man on top of the world. No question, the thing has to go. And in the vaunted “great awakening” to racial injustice underway in the country now (how long will it last? How deep does it run?) the museum, and the city, figured that out.
But here comes a question. What do we do with other monuments that have similar compositions but more complex images and histories, and are, in addition, works of aesthetic distinction (a claim rarely made for the Roosevelt statue)? I’m thinking of the Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts 54th Regiment in Boston — a monument that got graffiti-tagged during protests in May.
This bronze bas-relief by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, installed on the Boston Common in 1897, also centers on a dominant white equestrian figure, in this case surrounded by black men in military uniforms. It commemorates Shaw as the leader of the first all-black volunteer Union army brigade that formed in Boston in 1863, and marched to a battle in South Carolina, where many soldiers, including Shaw, died, and where they were all buried together.
The visuals here say “white supremacist,” too: the racially hierarchical composition, the single-name dedication, the suggestion of the Union army’s enforced segregation.
At the same time, does a narrative of interracial loyalties between leader and troops add a mitigating factor to a judgment of the work? Or the fact that Frederick Douglass came to Boston to attend the 1897 unveiling? (Two of his sons were in the 54th Regiment). Or even the fact that the Saint-Gaudens relief is widely regarded as a masterpiece of American public art?
To fully weigh such factors requires some knowledge of history, a discipline that has long been shunted aside in education. The story of Shaw and the 54th Regiment, or at least a highly romanticized version of it, has had the advantage of popular exposure: It was the subject of the 1989 film, “Glory. ” But even so, the monument was targeted by protesters. And the real question is, what’s the correct — meaning useful — response to the monument’s image of an egregious racial power dynamic? Eliminate or obscure it, or explain it?
All to say that the disposal of monuments should be approached case by case. Public political images are never innocent. But some are complex, with questions to ask and lessons to teach, while others — so-called “Lost Cause” Confederate monuments, created long after the Civil War to reassert white power — are, and were intended to be, racist assault weapons, plain and simple. In the current, healthy drive to neutralize assaultive images, it’s necessary, for history’s sake, that we first stand back, look hard, sort them out.
As for the disposition of the Roosevelt monument, which has not been officially announced, I have an idea. Clearly a racist artifact, the work cannot continue to serve as the visual introduction to an institution that, through its modern department of ethnology, is deeply devoted to the study of human culture.
I suggest that the museum retain the sculpture but display it for what it is: an outsize ethnological specimen, the product of a specific era and culture (the piece was unveiled in 1940, a year after the release of the “Lost Cause” film “Gone with the Wind”), now subject to critical evaluation in a different, Black Lives Matter era and culture. This conceptual change in use and value would require moving it, minus its base, into a gallery — and an apt context for display already exists.
In 2019, in response to earlier protests around the sculpture, the museum organized a small, ongoing documentary show called “Addressing the Statue,” which details the work’s history and includes commentary by contemporary ethnologists, social historians, art historians and artists.
Almost everyone says, in different ways, that the monument’s not a good thing and never was. And it would be useful for present and future audiences to be able to learn why it’s not a good thing, and why this not-good-thing — as big and bullying as a Tyrannosaurus — stood where it stood in this city for so long.
As for what might replace it out front, at the entrance: Something should. Why let an empty stone base the size of a small stage go to waste when we have so many politically savvy artists, young and old, who need a platform for their ideas?
As least one has already had a say about the Roosevelt monument: David Hammons, in a 1991 group show called “Dislocations” at the Museum of Modern Art. For his installation there, titled “Public Enemy,” he surrounded photomurals of the sculpture with sandbags and police barriers. Who was being protected? It — or us? Way back then he wanted it gone, and now the deal’s done. The museum should ask him over for a victory lap.
And the museum could commission new work, keep it impermanent and have it change often, even daily. Hammons’ “Public Enemy” was ephemeral. When the MoMA show ended, his installation disappeared, perhaps into closets, studios, dumpsters; I don’t know where. More and more right now, impermanence makes sense. Losses from COVID-19, the flood of violent deaths and a new political art that seems to exist entirely on plywood and pavement contribute to this perception.
We’re at an inflection point in this country, potentially the most significant one in generations. Black Lives Matter brought us here. Now it’s everyone’s job to sustain the momentum. New art certainly has a contribution to make. So do our historical public images.
Some examples, like the Roosevelt and Shaw monuments, are eye-and-mind grabbers, dense packages of information and emotion. We should study them as closely and critically as we do the monuments of any age and culture. We don’t have to like them; we just need to understand them, examine their mechanics, what made persuasive in their time, and how that persuasion works, or doesn’t, now.
By comparison, most of the commemorative statues now under attack across the land — and there are more and more each day — have little visual charisma. They’re generic period images of white male power. You’re tempted to think: If they go, small loss. Let’s move on.
Then you remember that each of those images comes with a name and a history, and some of those names belong to murderers, enslavers and genocists. And their history is our history. No matter how brutal their past or disservice, you shouldn’t destroy them. Keep them in a place where they can remind you of how bad the past has been.

NEW YORK — The turmoil coursing through cultural institutions around the country on the subject of race has made its way to the biggest museum of them all: the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
A top curator’s Instagram post that seemed critical of the Black Lives Matters movement and protests over monuments — shared on Juneteenth — has ignited objections by staff members, and a larger internal critique. On Tuesday, 15 Met staff members sent a letter urging the museum’s leadership to acknowledge “what we see as the expression of a deeply rooted logic of white supremacy and culture of systemic racism at our institution.”
The episode is the latest example of how arts institutions are grappling with issues of equity and diversity amid protests over the killing of George Floyd and an intensification of activity by the Black Lives Matter movement.
On Sunday, the American Museum of Natural History in New York announced that its equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt would be removed because it had come to be seen as symbolic of a painful legacy of colonial expansion and racial discrimination.
On Monday, the Guggenheim Museum’s curatorial department in a letter described a work culture of “racism” and “white supremacy.” On Tuesday, current and former employees accused the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art of “racist censorship” and “discrimination.”
And Friday, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland for 23 years, Jill Snyder, resigned after apologizing to artist Shaun Leonardo for canceling his exhibition dealing with police killings of Black and Latino boys and men.
Now, Met Museum employees are sounding their own alarm, prompted by a personal Instagram posting Friday by the museum’s powerful chairman of European paintings, Keith Christiansen, who has worked at the Met since 1977.
Below a pen-and-ink image of French archaeologist Alexandre Lenoir, who devoted himself to saving France’s historic monuments from the ravages of the French Revolution, Christiansen wrote: “Alexandre Lenoir battling the revolutionary zealots bent on destroying the royal tombs in Saint Denis. How many great works of art have been lost to the desire to rid ourselves of a past of which we don’t approve.
“And how grateful we are to people like Lenoir,” Christiansen continued, “who realized that their value — both artistic and historical — extended beyond a defining moment of social and political upheaval and change.” While Christiansen appeared to be arguing for the preservation of monuments, his remarks also struck some as insensitive and tone deaf.
The post was criticized in a Twitter post by Art + Museum Transparency, an advocacy group of arts workers: “Dear @metmuseum, one of your most powerful curators suggested that it’s a shame we’re trying to ‘rid ourselves of a past of which we don’t approve’ by removing monuments — and, worse, making a dog whistle of an equation of #BLM activists with ‘revolutionary zealots.’ This is not OK.”
Responses to the tweet were similarly critical.
“This is disgusting,” one comment said, “not acceptable.”
Christiansen subsequently took down the post and removed his Instagram account.
Asked to respond to the uproar over the post Wednesday, Max Hollein, the Met’s director, said in a statement to The New York Times: “There is no doubt that the Met and its development is also connected with a logic of what is defined as white supremacy. Our ongoing efforts to not only diversify our collection but also our programs, narratives, contexts and staff will be further accelerated and will benefit in urgency and impact from this time.”
A day earlier, he had apologized directly to the European paintings department in an email, calling the Instagram post “not only not appropriate and misguided in its judgment but simply wrong.”
“Keith is a very valued member of our community and while this post was on Keith’s personal Instagram account, it is certainly also part of our institutional conversation and we need to reflect on that,” Hollein added.
It was Hollein’s second apology this month; he also conveyed one to artist Glenn Ligon, about the Met’s use of one of his works in a social media post, at the start of the protests over George Floyd’s killing. Ligon said on Instagram: “I know it’s #nationalreachouttoblackfolksweek but could y’all just stop … Or ask me first?”
On June 12, Hollein and Daniel H. Weiss, the museum’s president and chief executive, sent an email to the staff that discussed how “we are moving the museum forward in our work to address issues of diversity and racism within our institution.”
The measures included convening a series of discussions on racial justice; aiming to further diversify the staff; hiring a chief diversity officer; instituting mandatory anti-racism training; and declaring June 24 as a Museum Day of Reflection. Their email also added, “we will continue to explore themes of representation and diversity through our programming.”
On Tuesday, Christiansen, who declined to be interviewed, issued his own apology in an email to the entire staff.
“I will make no excuses except to say that I had in mind one thing and lacked the awareness to self-reflect on how my post could go in a very different direction, on a very important day … and would cause further hurt to those experiencing so much pain right now,” he wrote. “I want to be clear on my view that monuments of those who promoted racist ideologies and systems should never be glorified or in a location where they can cause further harm.”
Christiansen continued, “This instance has further taught me that we, as members of this institution, are in the position of power to help correct a problematic history, and we must be self-aware and allies at every moment in this fight.”
But the Instagram post had touched a nerve. A group of staff members at the Met followed up with a letter to Hollein and Weiss.
“All of us were angered that the post seemed to equate Black Lives Matter protesters with ‘revolutionary zealots’ — a position made crueler by its posting on Juneteenth,” said the letter, which was signed by the 15 “ERG Co-Convenors,” a reference to the museum’s employee resources groups, an outgrowth of the Met’s diversity efforts.
Questioning how many other managers might share such views, the letter said: “While we understand that a private Instagram account does not necessarily reflect the views of the institution for which Christensen works — our Met — his position of power within it, and the decision-making he affects as a department head and senior curator with regard to programming, staff hiring, and institutional direction, is more to our point.”
In his response to the letter’s authors, Weiss acknowledged that “we have moved too slowly in building an institution that more honestly reflects the communities we serve or that honors our aspirations.”
Citing the additional complications of the “toxic and polarizing language of our national political leadership” and the Met’s staff of more than 2,000, Weiss added, “Sometimes, mistakes will be made — including by us.”
Hollein and Weiss plan to meet with the employee resources group June 30. Whether such efforts by the Met — which just announced that it would reopen Aug. 29 — will succeed in calming the waters remains to be seen.
“The path forward will be challenging,” Weiss said in his statement, “but for the first time in many years there is a collective will to build a better community, one that works for all.”

Jon Batiste, the jazz pianist and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” bandleader, has spent the last three weekends marching in the streets of New York, leading musicians and protesters through hymns and songs like “We Shall Overcome” and “Down by the Riverside.” Those without a horn or drum sing and, at Batiste’s exhortation, say their names : George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. And many others.
On June 12, however, Batiste opened his protest concert, part of a series called “We Are,” seated at an upright piano in front of Barclays Center in Brooklyn, wearing a mask and bright-blue protective gloves. Unaccompanied, surrounded by hundreds of silent protesters, he dug deep into a song that he says demands reinvention: “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
“We all know that Francis Scott Key owned slaves,” Batiste said of the song’s lyricist in a Zoom interview last week. In Batiste’s hands, the national anthem seethes, mourns and aspires, drawing on the rollicking stride piano of Fats Waller and the volcanic eruptions of Art Tatum.
“The way that Jimi Hendrix took the song, the way that Marvin Gaye or Whitney took it — that tradition is what I am thinking of when I play it,” Batiste, 33, added. “The diaspora that they infused into it is a response to the toxic ideologies that are embedded in the song and thus in the culture.”
The history of jazz is in many ways a history of protest, of celebrating blackness and insisting on individual freedom. Composer and bass player William Parker, who has taken free jazz from community centers to Town Hall, traces this spirit to works like Duke Ellington’s 1943 “Black, Brown and Beige” to later suites by Max Roach and Sonny Rollins, and the free jazz and loft jazz movements of the 1960s and ’70s. Then came the ’80s, when “everybody went to sleep thinking that we had accomplished something, but all we really got were the leftovers,” Parker said in a Zoom interview.
Artists like Parker, of course, have performed and recorded revolution-minded “fire music” through the 1980s and up to the present, and the last decade has seen a resurgence in political jazz music, especially from the downtown, avant-garde and Brooklyn scenes.
It’s certainly rare, though, to see a jazz musician with a household name and a national platform like Batiste inviting thousands into the streets. And the pianist has the support of Colbert, who has carved out time on his broadcast to discuss his musical director’s activism.
“In the present darkness that constitutes so much of the national conversation, Jon, by his example and his spirit, gives me hope I might do my job and maintain my own humanity,” Colbert said in an email. “I believe long after no one knows who I am, the name Jon Batiste will be spoken with admiration. I’m grateful to know him.”
A genre-crossing virtuoso and crowd-pleaser, Batiste is particularly suited for a moment of protest in the streets: He’s from New Orleans, where the city’s famed Second Line marches have built a tradition of “catharsis and release,” he said, in which music lifts anguish or outrage toward a collective joy. He grew up surrounded by musical relatives and draws special inspiration from his grandfather, the president of a New Orleans postal workers union, who marched and organized for his workers.
“Jon is walking in that lineage, and not just musically,” said Brian Blade, a drummer and composer with his own strong New Orleans connection. “It’s in the essence of our feet on the ground, moving forward, gathering a movement through example.”
A spirit of collective humanity has always powered Batiste’s art. His “Late Show” band, Stay Human, is a diverse ensemble known for marching right into the crowd during performances. The protests take their name from “We Are,” his new single, a pop gospel showcase written and recorded last year that features the marching band from St. Augustine High School in New Orleans. He recorded “Star Spangled Banner,” with all that thunder, on the 2013 album “Social Music .” And at the marches the music is indisputably social.
“It was such a powerful day,” saxophonist Grace Kelly, a frequent Batiste collaborator, said of Batiste’s June 6 march from Union Square to Washington Square Park, which organizers say drew 5,000 people. “There were over 10 tubas, 30-plus trumpets and maybe 50 saxophones. It was louder than we could speak. Louder than we could sing.”
Batiste and his organizers are weighing the logistics of taking the “We Are” protests to cities across the United States in the coming months, focusing on a practical goal: voter registration and the exposure of voter suppression.
“There are three candidates that we’re dealing with,” Batiste said. “Donald Trump, Joe Biden and the candidate of apathy. Apathy’s insidious. It comes from having a weight on our collective shoulders for centuries that has made us feel that we don’t matter, that we’re not seen and that our vote doesn’t count.”
Like many of the city’s jazz players, Caroline Davis, a saxophonist and composer, has protested at several Brooklyn and Manhattan rallies in recent weeks. “It’s inspiring to be with people who are in this for the long haul,” she said, after marching with Batiste on June 6, the first time she’s gotten to play music with colleagues in person since March.
Davis co-teaches a course in jazz and gender at the New School and feels a responsibility to honor jazz’s history of protest. “I feel that, as Nina Simone said, it’s the artist’s job to reference the time in which we live,” she said.
Parker has dedicated his career to nurturing that activist spirit. He has marched dozens of times since 2016 with the Artists for a Free World marching band, a loose collective organized by Arts for Art, the nonprofit organization that hosts the annual Vision Festival and is presenting Zoom concerts and salons.
“I’ve been talking for the last, oh, 40 years or so about how every once in a while a window opens up and things can happen,” Parker, 68, said. “But we have to have numbers, we have to be persistent, and we have to really lay it out in the consciousness of people.”
Last week, on Bandcamp he released the searing and mournful “Baldwin,” a track from a coming 10-disc box set of new material dedicated to “those who want to eliminate hate, racism, sexism, greed and lies.”
He’s not alone in sharing fresh music keyed to the cause: Drummer Johnathan Blake and vibes player Joel Ross both released pre-COVID commissioned concerts from the Jazz Gallery on YouTube. The sets, titled “My Life Matters” and “Being a Young Black Man,” come with requests for donations to Black Lives Matter and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. And poet Camae Ayewa shouts: “Enough! Enough! Enough!” over the free-jazz squall of “Irreversible Live in Berlin” on a pair of blistering live sets from the protest-minded quintet Irreversible Entanglements.
“Music is a wake-up call,” Parker said. “After the protest, you listen to it and it helps keep you awake. Because the problem is not to wake up — it’s not to go back to sleep.”
Batiste believes it’s his responsibility to use his platform to keep the crowds awake. That platform is also expanding. Batiste’s fingers will power the music in “Soul ,” the first Pixar feature to center on a Black lead, slated for a Nov. 20 release.
He has maintained the kind of proudly unpredictable career common to 21st-century jazz musicians. In 2019 he released a pair of in-the-tradition Verve albums recorded at the Village Vanguard. Since then he’s debuted a funk-favoring band of all-women collaborators on NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts and improvised on an independent release, “Meditations , ” with guitarist Cory Wong.
Despite his personal success, he remains focused on the inequality he’s committed to fighting. “Four hundred and one years of people and their voices being completely marginalized has led to systemic racism and sexism that has been perpetuated even in our triumphs,” he said. “The idea that we can have triumphs and also perpetuate toxic ideologies is a nuance that we have yet to explore in the public dialogue. But now there’s a chance for a real collective consciousness shifting.”

A Softball Team’s Tweet to Trump Leads Players to Quit Mid-Series [With graphic(s)]

For a few hours this week, softball had a shot at something it has pursued for decades: the spotlight. The USSSA Pride and Scrap Yard Fast Pitch, two independent professional softball teams that feature some of the top players in the world, began what was supposed to be a seven-game series in Melbourne, Florida, facing little competition from other live sports.
Instead, the first day of the series ended with all 18 players for Scrap Yard Fast Pitch cleaning out their lockers and pledging to never play again for the organization, after its general manager bragged to President Donald Trump on Twitter during the game that the team was standing during the national anthem.
The tweet, sent from the team’s official account by Connie May, the team’s general manager, said: “Hey @realDonaldTrump Pro Fastpitch being played live … Everyone standing for the FLAG!”
Trump has frequently criticized athletes who kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality, a movement started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the NFL that spread throughout the league and led to bitter divisions among sports fans..
After Monday’s game, players said, they returned to the locker room to discover a slew of text messages and alerts about May’s post.
“It was a shock,” said pitcher Cat Osterman, 37, an Olympic gold medalist. “An actual, genuine, speechless shock took over our locker room.”
Then the players started talking to one another, pinpointing what they felt was most troubling about the post: that May had spoken for all of them without their consent and that she ascribed political intent to their actions during the anthem that suggested opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement.
The tweet was quickly deleted, apparently after it had drawn backlash online. May and Scrap Yard Fast Pitch did not respond to requests for comment.
The players spent an hour discussing the issue in the locker room and decided that they could no longer play under the Scrap Yard name. “The more we talked about it, the angrier I got, and I finally just said, ‘I’m done; I’m not going to wear this jersey,’ ” Osterman said. “We were used as pawns in a political post, and that’s not OK.”
The players were supported in their decision by the coaching staff.
It was not the first time that May’s politics had been a topic of discussion among the team, which is made up of 18 women ranging in age from 22 to 37. When Scrap Yard released a statement about the killing of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis, it read, “We believe black lives matter, as do all lives,” causing some consternation among the players.
The tweet Monday, though, struck a raw nerve. “I never really thought that she didn’t care about my life or Kiki’s life until that post,” said Kelsey Stewart, one of two Black players on the team, along with Kiki Stokes.
May came to talk with the team and again repeated that “all lives matter,” players said, a phrase that has been criticized as a way to invalidate the specific concerns of Black people.
“People got very, very angry,” said Stewart, 25, who phoned into the meeting after missing the game for personal reasons.
Most Scrap Yard players are white, but Stewart said they still forcefully challenged May’s comments both directly and on social media.
“It was nice to know that Kiki, who’s Black, didn’t have to do all the talking — that I didn’t have to do all the talking,” Stewart said.
Stewart, who was set to play in her first Olympics this summer before the Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021, said racism in softball “has been an issue for me as long as I can remember,” from assumptions that she plays outfield or is unusually fast to racist slurs on social media. The sport is mostly white, especially at the highest levels, and after Floyd’s death that imbalance seemed more urgent than ever, she said.
“I talked to some of my Black softball sisters like, we can’t be quiet anymore — it’s not really an option for us,” Stewart said.
The players said they felt confident in their decision despite the fact that Scrap Yard is one of very few organizations sponsoring top-tier professional softball teams.
“We’re not going to tolerate that in our sport,” Osterman said. “It wasn’t as hard of a decision as everyone thinks it was, because we knew it was the right thing to do.”

Después de adjudicarse el fracaso del mitin en Oklahoma de Donald Trump, los ejércitos digitales de seguidores de K-pop se sienten empoderados.
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín por correo con lo mejor de The New York Times.
Desde hace tiempo, en algunos rincones de internet, las destrezas de organización de los amantes del K-pop —los entusiastas de la música pop coreana, típicamente jóvenes diversos de todo el mundo, que se congregan a diario en las redes sociales— se han considerado legendarias: por medio de acciones grupales coordinadas, los ejércitos de seguidores de bandas como BTS y Blackpink se aseguran de que sus ídolos favoritos sean tendencia, encabecen las listas de éxitos musicales y de que se agoten las entradas para sus conciertos en estadios desde Corea del Sur hasta el Rose Bowl de Los Ángeles y el Citi Field de Nueva York.
Ahora, en medio de una pandemia, una próxima elección presidencial y conversaciones ineludibles sobre cuestiones raciales, este colectivo disperso de guerreros digitales está tratando de ejercer su influencia en un nuevo ámbito: la arena política estadounidense.
Los “stans” (fanáticos obsesionados) del K-pop, inspirados al inicio por las protestas del movimiento Black Lives Matter en todo el mundo, se dieron a conocer fuera de los círculos musicales este fin de semana, cuando algunos se atribuyeron el haber ayudado a inflar las expectativas de asistencia al mitin del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, en Oklahoma, al reservar boletos que no planeaban usar. Sin embargo, aunque la campaña de Trump niega que la broma mordaz haya afectado la asistencia al mitin —más bien culpó a los manifestantes y los medios—, el llamado a la acción en los círculos del K-pop revela una creciente consciencia de que las tácticas eficientes que usan los fanáticos en redes sociales para reunir fondos o hacer viral una canción también se pueden usar para el activismo político.
En semanas recientes, los adeptos al K-pop —quienes usan Twitter como centro de operaciones, pero proliferan en TikTok, Facebook, Instagram y otras plataformas— llenaron de mensajes críticos una tarjeta de cumpleaños para Trump, desbordaron una aplicación de la policía de Dallas que busca información sobre los manifestantes e inundaron de etiquetas que supuestamente apoyaban a supremacistas blancos mientras anunciaron que habían igualado una donación de 1 millón de dólares que el grupo BTS hizo a organismos relacionados con Black Lives Matter. Además, en concordancia con la creciente popularidad del K-pop en Estados Unidos, muchos de estos incipientes activistas digitales podrían ser ciudadanos estadounidenses, según expertos.
“Los seguidores anglohablantes del K-pop que se están involucrando en esto, que están al tanto de estos asuntos, no son extranjeros”, comentó CedarBough Saeji, académica que estudia la cultura de los seguidores del K-pop. “Son estadounidenses”.
“No sorprende que esta gente joven, abierta y progresista en términos sociales que de verdad es adepta a usar estas plataformas en línea (quienes están atrapados en casa y pasan todavía más tiempo conectados a causa de la COVID-19) esté realizando acciones políticas”, agregó Saeji, profesora adjunta de Cultura de Asia Oriental que está haciendo una residencia en la Universidad de Indiana Bloomington. “Son jóvenes que están totalmente dispuestos a aprender acerca de una nueva cultura por su interés en algún producto de la cultura pop. Es justo lo opuesto al tipo de gente que sigue a Trump, quienes le aplauden cuando insulta la película Parásitos y dice que Lo que el viento se llevó es una película de verdad”.
En los días posteriores al mitin de Trump en Tulsa, no ha surgido ninguna evidencia de que los entusiastas surcoreanos del K-pop estén involucrados de manera significativa en la campaña de “inasistencia”. Los medios surcoreanos difundieron información estadounidense que les llegó desde Tulsa, y en esencia consideraron el episodio una broma de seguidores adolescentes del K-pop y usuarios de TikTok de Estados Unidos.
Los surcoreanos tienden a seguir de cerca las elecciones estadounidenses porque podrían afectar las relaciones de alianza entre Washington y Seúl, y la política estadounidense sobre Corea del Norte. Pero generalmente se muestran cautelosos de tomar partido en la política estadounidense. Trump ha sido bastante popular entre los surcoreanos liberales, incluidos los jóvenes, al aumentar la esperanza de que su estrategia diplomática con el líder de Corea del Norte, Kim Jong-un, pueda producir un avance en las conversaciones largamente estancadas sobre el fin de la amenaza nuclear del norte y establecer paz en la península de Corea.
El lunes, algunos surcoreanos respondieron a las noticias de Tulsa con preocupación sobre cómo podría reaccionar Trump. “Por qué el K-pop se entromete en una disputa política estadounidense”, escribió el lector de un artículo sobre el mitin en un periódico local.
No obstante, mientras en Corea del Sur la cultura del K-pop es en gran medida un asunto de la cultura popular y apolítico, en la que las legiones de admiradores se enfocan en impulsar la venta de álbumes y apoyar a sus ídolos, la postura de esta comunidad como una subcultura en Estados Unidos podría prestarse para actos más radicales, en especial en una época de creciente polarización política.
“Aunque los mensajes del K-pop no son abiertamente políticos, a menudo hablan de empoderamiento y confianza en uno mismo”, comentó el autor del blog Ask a Korean! (¡Pregúntale a un coreano!), quien usa el pseudónimo T. K. Park. “Por ejemplo, a muchos amantes del K-pop les empezó a gustar BTS al inicio porque el mensaje del grupo de ‘quiérete a ti mismo’ resonó con fuerza en ellos”. Además, debido a que ese tipo de contenido ha atraído a una audiencia compuesta en su mayor parte de mujeres y gente de color, agregó Park, “este mensaje los impulsa a ser más expresivos en todos los aspectos de su vida, incluida la política”.
Por otro lado, ya habían perfeccionado las habilidades necesarias. “Los admiradores del K-pop aprendieron a organizarse por medio de su fanaticada”, mencionó Park. “El K-pop es una música de origen digital”, agregó, y la temprana adopción del servicio de banda ancha a nivel nacional en Corea del Sur “hizo que la música pop coreana respondiera a las exigencias de internet, y también convirtió a los fanáticos del K-pop en los actores más sofisticados del ámbito digital”. Park citó como ejemplos de su entrenamiento las campañas casi constantes para inundar a estaciones de radio con solicitudes de canciones o agotar en cuestión de minutos los boletos para los conciertos: “Todas estas actividades se pueden aplicar en la política con mucha facilidad”.
Nicole Santero, fanática y estudiante de doctorado con un enfoque en BTS Army que también administra la cuenta centrada en datos @ResearchBTS, descubrió que en mayo solo hubo dos días en que un término relacionado con el grupo no estaba entre las tendencias mundiales en Twitter.
“A veces ni siquiera pretenden ser tendencia, pero hay tantos de ellos que algunas veces, accidentalmente, hacen tendencia palabras al azar”, dijo. “Son personas realmente apasionadas que luchan por lo que aman. Esas características se traducen bien cuando se miran los temas sociales”.
Una vocera de Twitter comentó que el K-pop era el género musical sobre el que más se tuitea a nivel mundial, con más de 6100 millones de tuits en 2019, un aumento del 15 por ciento en comparación con el año anterior. BTS fue el artista sobre el que más se ha tuiteado en los últimos tres años, agregó la empresa. TikTok y Facebook se rehusaron a revelar sus datos.
El giro reciente hacia el activismo político en Estados Unidos también concuerda con un esfuerzo coordinado de los seguidores del K-pop en los últimos años para generar un cambio positivo, en parte como respuesta a su reputación de superficiales, absurdos e incluso de muchedumbre amenazante. Al igual que la mayoría de las fervientes bases de admiradores de estrellas del pop estadounidense —Beliebers de Justin Bieber, BeyHive de Beyoncé o Barbz de Nicki Minaj, grupos conocidos en conjunto como “stans” por la canción “Stan” de Eminem sobre un acosador obsesivo—, los seguidores del K-pop han sido acusados de acoso por atacar en grupo a sus críticos o rivales. En Corea del Sur, también se les ha considerado demasiado aduladores y hasta algo parecido a un culto que se reúne para, por ejemplo, comprar regalos como relojes de lujo para cantantes famosos.
Sin embargo, en la actualidad, son más comunes las donaciones filantrópicas a causas no controvertidas como los pobres, los ancianos y los enfermos terminales, a menudo en nombre de ciertos artistas. “Fue una manera de mejorar la imagen de las fanaticadas ante la mirada pública”, señaló Saeji.
En particular, Black Lives Matter podría representar una causa urgente para los seguidores del K-pop por la deuda de los artistas con la cultura del hiphop y la música negra, pues grupos como BTS han sido acusados de apropiación cultural. “Los artistas, los directores, los escritores, los bailarines, los diseñadores, los productores y los estilistas en la industria del K-pop reciben su inspiración de la cultura negra, lo reconozcan o no”, escribió hace poco en Instagram el rapero y cantante surcoreano CL.
“Hay fanáticos del K-pop que educan a otros fanáticos del K-pop sobre esto”, dijo Saeji, señalando el entusiasmo general en todos los temas, tanto serios como más triviales. “Puedes revisar lo que tuitean seguidores de K-pop en Twitter y verás a usuarios publicar reflexiones sobre Black Lives Matter y, diez minutos después, publicar algo sobre el ídolo más lindo del que están totalmente enamorados. No lo consideran una contradicción”.
“Lo que es realmente importante de todo esto es que gente joven está viendo el poder político que tienen, están mostrando su fuerza y lo están disfrutando”, agregó. “¿Y sabes qué van a hacer ahora?” Van a votar. En este momento, los fanáticos del K-pop no se están sintiendo cínicos. Se están sintiendo empoderados”.

WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats said Tuesday that they would block Republicans’ attempts to advance a narrow bill to encourage police departments to revise their practices, rejecting the measure as “woefully inadequate” and setting up a clash that could mark the death of a fledgling congressional effort to address racial bias in law enforcement.
Their decision, outlined the day before a planned test vote on the Republican bill, reflected deep opposition to the measure among Democrats and civil rights leaders, who have dismissed the legislation as an antiquated and inadequate response to systemic racism in policing amid a national outcry for an overhaul.
It also reflected an election-year political bet by Democrats that they can gain more by blocking what they consider a fundamentally flawed measure — and blaming Republicans for the demise of reform efforts — than by trying to salvage it, which could provide cover for Republicans in the eyes of voters who increasingly regard the issue as urgent.
“No bill will pass as a result of this ploy by Sen. McConnell,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on the Senate floor, referring to Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Schumer implored Republicans to negotiate a more expansive bill that both parties could support. “The Republican majority has given the Senate a bad bill and proposed no credible way to sufficiently improve it,” he said.
The Republican bill, spearheaded by Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the party’s lone African American member in the chamber, is vastly different from the one congressional Democrats have proposed. The Democratic bill is expected to pass the House on Thursday; McConnell has said that package is “going nowhere” in his chamber.
Scott’s bill would provide incentives for state and local police departments to make changes, including limiting the use of chokeholds and penalizing departments that do not require the use of body cameras, but would not alter the qualified immunity doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits or place new federal restrictions on the use of lethal force.
The House measure, the most expansive intervention into policing that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory, would change qualified immunity, raise the bar for the use of lethal force, make it easier to track and prosecute police misconduct, and aim to force departments to eliminate the use of chokeholds.
If Senate Republicans fail Wednesday to muster the 60 votes necessary to advance to debate on Scott’s bill — as now seems all but certain — it would be a major setback in efforts to enact an overhaul this year targeting excessive use of force and racial discrimination by law enforcement, as protesters across the nation continue to clamor for major changes. And it would be the latest in a litany of pressing issues that have paralyzed the Senate, where freewheeling debate, negotiation and compromise on legislation that can become law have become the exception rather than the rule.
Republicans were furious Tuesday at Democrats’ refusal to advance the measure and accused them of deliberately creating a logjam for political purposes, rather than trying to find a way to enact meaningful change.
“If your objective is to solve the issue of police reform and not campaign on the issue of police reform, the way you do that is by coming to the table and voting yes, so that we have an opportunity before the entire American public to understand what the differences are, iron them out and move it forward,” Scott told reporters. “If this is more about campaign rhetoric and presidential elections, then they will not vote yes for this.”
McConnell brushed away Democrats’ complaints and insisted that the Senate would proceed with the vote Wednesday as planned, arguing that they should at least try to modify the measure rather than rejecting it before even starting debate.
“If they don’t feel like they’ve had fair treatment, their remedy is to refuse to finish the bill,” he said. “There’s literally no harm done by debating this important topic.”
But Democrats appeared to see plenty of risk in proceeding with a measure that falls well short of what their core supporters demand, and to be confident that voters would blame Republicans, not them, for the death of the policing overhaul effort. They have been making the case for nearly two years that the Senate has become a legislative graveyard for Democratic initiatives, an impression McConnell himself has often fed.
In a letter Tuesday to McConnell, Schumer, along with Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey — sponsors of the Democratic bill — called the Republican measure “so threadbare and lacking in substance that it does not even provide a proper baseline for negotiations.”
“We will not meet this moment by holding a floor vote on the Justice Act, nor can we simply amend this bill,” they wrote. “This bill is not salvageable, and we need bipartisan talks to get to a constructive starting point.”
They received additional cover after dozens of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, wrote to lawmakers urging them to block the legislation.
“The question simply is: Who do you trust more on police reform in America?” Booker said. “The NAACP or Mitch McConnell?”
The breakdown fueled frustration in both parties Tuesday, with Republicans and Democrats bitterly pointing fingers at each other for the emerging stalemate, even as a frenzied round of hushed discussions unfolded in private to try to salvage the effort.
In a tense back-and-forth on the floor, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, one of the drafters of the Republican bill, asked Harris how she could oppose legislation that included a bill she spearheaded that would make lynching a federal crime.
“It’s like asking a mother: save one of your children and leave the others,” Harris replied.
In private, Scott shocked his colleagues when he spoke at Republicans’ weekly luncheon about death threats he and his aides had received in recent days, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door remarks. He played some aloud for his colleagues, all of whom are white.
The calls, filled with profanity and racist slurs, included one diatribe addressed to “Uncle Tim,” where the caller, after cruelly and profanely condemning Scott, his family and some of his Republican colleagues, told Scott to “take your one-way ticket straight to hell.”
One caller discussed putting the senator “in his crosshairs,” Scott said.
“It’s interesting that we are on the right side of the police reform conversation, yet we’re on the wrong side according to the people, based on the way that we are characterized in the national press,” Scott said in a brief interview, after playing two of the calls his office had received.
While racist attacks and threats are not new to Scott or his office, he said they had become more aggressive in recent days.
Both parties have reason to resist a compromise. Republicans in recent weeks have rushed to devise a response to the public outcry for change, putting forward significant policing legislation for the first time in years and beginning to speak in frank terms about racism in America, a topic they have often avoided. But they are unwilling to stray too far from President Donald Trump — who has emphasized “law and order,” advocated tough police tactics and ignored the issue of racism in law enforcement — and risk alienating their base with the kind of sweeping measures Democrats are demanding.
Eyeing an increasingly favorable political environment, Democrats have little incentive to adopt a narrower overhaul or open themselves to potentially difficult votes on law enforcement matters. The collapse of the Senate bill would allow them to skewer Republicans for failing to adequately respond to the crisis as they try to regain the Senate majority in the fall. And if their refusal to budge produces concessions by Republicans — as was the case when they initially blocked two coronavirus relief packages they called insufficient — they could still claim credit.
“I do not intend to be a part of a discussion where some might suggest Democrats are trying to stand in the way of police reform,” Harris told reporters. “In this case, sadly, it is the Democrats — not with any of our Republican colleagues, at least so far — that are doing the real work of engaging in what must be reform of the system.”
Some lawmakers were holding out hope that closed-door conversations between Scott, Booker, Harris and others could yet yield a compromise. But leaving one such meeting Tuesday afternoon, Scott voiced no such optimism.
“If they won’t even start it,” he said of Democrats, “that tells me that this is already over.”

Gun Violence Spikes in NYC, Intensifying Debate Over Policing [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — It has been nearly a quarter century since New York City experienced as much gun violence in the month of June as it has seen this year.
The city logged 125 shootings in the first three weeks of the month, more than double the number recorded over the same period last year, police data show. Gunmen opened fire during house parties, barbecues, dice games, and carried out coldly calculated street executions.
More than a dozen people have been fatally shot, including a teenager at her college graduation party and a clothing designer who was washing his car.
“You have to go back to 1996 to have a worse start of June,” Michael LiPetri, the chief of crime control strategies, said in an interview Monday.
The rising toll of gun violence has become part of a contentious debate over the future of policing in the wake of mass protests against police brutality. Police unions and their supporters have issued shrill warnings that the city was slipping into a high-crime era reminiscent of the early 1990s.
The city is not alone. Shootings are on the rise in other big cities across the country, including Chicago and Minneapolis, a trend that some conservatives have seized on to argue against the recent demands of protesters to cut police budgets and rein in officers.
On Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city was sending more officers into the streets and declared he would not retreat from efforts to overhaul the Police Department.
“We’re not going back to the bad old days when there was so much violence in the city,” the mayor said at a news conference, “nor are we going back to the bad old days where policing was done the wrong way and, in too many cases, police and community could never connect and find that mutual respect.”
The mayor’s comments came after a particularly bad weekend in which 38 people were shot over 72 hours. The toll continued to mount Monday, when a 46-year-old man was shot and killed in Brownsville by a gunman who ambushed him in the lobby of a public housing building, the police said. That evening, five people were shot at a candlelight vigil in Crown Heights.
Other cities are seeing similar violence: In Chicago, more than 100 people were shot over the weekend, the most in a single weekend since 2012, and 14 died. That carnage came just weeks after 24 people were killed among 85 people shot over the Memorial Day weekend. Many were caught in crossfire.
In Minneapolis, police said that 111 people have been shot in the four weeks since the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed in police custody, sparked nationwide protests.
Nationally, homicide rates were already rising in 64 large American cities for the first three months of 2020 over the previous three years, but on average the pandemic caused them to stall briefly, before ticking up again in May, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Rosenfeld is also a co-author of a study about homicide rates during the pandemic to be released Thursday by Arnold Ventures, a philanthropy focused on criminal justice and other issues.
In New York, there were 166 murders through June 21, up from 134 over the same period last year, the police said.
Some of that increase can be attributed to both the strain of the pandemic and the recent unrest, although the primary reason cited by criminologists was the advent of summer — traditionally a high-crime season because people are outside for longer and tempers flare in the heat.
In New York, the police have linked the rise in gun violence to a bail law enacted this year, which limited judges’ ability to keep people in jail before trial if they had been arrested on certain charges, as well as the release of thousands of people from jail and prison to help curb coronavirus. LiPetri said 17% of shootings involved people on probation or parole.
Even veteran observers of the city’s crime trends viewed the jump in New York City as remarkable.
“I have been studying this for a long time. I have never seen that much of an increase ever,” said Christopher Herrmann, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice who once analyzed crime statistics for the New York City Police Department.
Hermann said the spike in shootings likely stemmed from “combination of warmer weather, COVID cabin fever and the traditional gun violence that we see in June, July and August.”
Some criminologists said there is a precedent for crime rising after unrest over police killings.
Homicides rose nationally in the aftermath of the unrest ignited by the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. It went up 15-20% in the largest cities before subsiding again after two years, Rosenfeld said. When discontent with the police ran high, people were less likely to call them, deciding to settle matters themselves and driving violence up, he said.
“There is every reason to believe that we will see an increase in homicides and other violent crimes associated with the current unrest,” he said.
Eugene O’Donnell, who is also a professor at John Jay, said that while the rise in shootings signaled a collapse in public safety in New York neighborhoods most affected by violence, it was too soon to predict a doomsday scenario.
“The sum total of all of that is grounds to worry, but I have happily sat back and watched them predict Armageddon that hasn’t come for years,” O’Donnell, a former city police officer and prosecutor, said. “Whether shootings go up or down, I think things have dramatically changed for the worst in communities affected by this problem.”
Some of those neighborhoods are now seeing an influx of officers deployed as part of the Police Department’s annual Summer All Out strategy, in which officers in desk jobs and other duties are redeployed to the street to discourage violence.
About 300 officers have been sent this year to neighborhoods like East Harlem in Manhattan, Mott Haven in the Bronx, East New York in Brooklyn and Jamaica in Queens. Those neighborhoods struggle with conflicts between crews and gangs that police say fuel half of the shootings in the city.
So far this year, police have solved just 28% of shootings with an arrest, LiPetri said, even though that proportion is normally around half.
Often, investigators know who is responsible for a shooting but lack sufficient evidence to make an arrest. Victims often refuse to cooperate with police investigations, and witnesses are afraid of retaliation if they come forward.
The state’s new bail law and the pandemic have made it more difficult to build those cases, police officials have said, because it is harder for prosecutors to leverage their power to keep people behind bars.
LiPetri said a slowdown in court proceedings because of the virus has also stymied the efforts to curb violence. Although police arrested more people for gun possession this year, he said many were released because their cases could not be presented to a grand jury within six days, the statutory limit for holding people in custody without an indictment.
About 800 gun cases are still waiting to be presented to grand juries, he said, and 40% of people arrested on gun possession charges had been released without bail so far this year.
In the past the New York police have relied on plainclothes “anti-crime units” to proactively hunt for people believed to be carrying illegal guns on the streets, but their aggressive tactics had led to many complaints and several police shootings. Commissioner Dermot F. Shea disbanded the units last week.
The city is instead leaning more heavily on nonprofits that employ “violence interrupters" — young men and women with past ties to gangs who intervene to try to stop street conflicts from escalating.
One of the nonprofits in Brownsville was scrambling on Monday to figure out why a 46-year-old man was killed and who might want to retaliate. Anthony Newerls, the program director at Brownsville In, Violence Out, said it was the second fatal shooting in the neighborhood in 10 days. “We are completely overwhelmed,” he said.
Not all of the areas of the city that have struggled with shootings in the past have seen increases. Iesha Sekou’s group, Street Corner Resources, oversees a stretch of Harlem that has not seen a shooting since April 25.
Sekou said the changes brought on by the pandemic as well as the weather have created a ripe environment for shootings to unfold. Her group has focused on keeping tabs on who is getting out of jail or prison, particularly if they have been involved in shootings, because they might have unfinished business.
Usually, there is a party to celebrate the occasion, and she shows up. "We would go over there and give out masks and gloves, and we would say, ‘We need y’all to make sure there’s no violence,’” she said.

Poolside at President Donald Trump’s resort near Miami, dozens of guests sunned last weekend on lounge chairs and chatted in cabanas. Golfers fanned out across multiple courses, and the hotel lobby hummed with activity for the first time in months.
But the reopening of Trump National Doral, the most important source of revenue for the president’s strained family business, came as new cases of the coronavirus spiked in surrounding Miami-Dade County and public health officials urged caution about resuming normal activity.
Virus cases in Florida exceeded 100,000 on Monday, with more than 3,100 deaths. About one-quarter of the cases have been in Miami-Dade County, a per capita rate twice the number statewide. On Tuesday, the county reported an average positive test rate of 12.4% in recent weeks. The latest single-day positive rate rose to 25.9%.
“We don’t really have too much good news going on countywide, said Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the epidemiology department at Florida International University. “We have to assume that people are going to be at some level of risk when they encounter other people.”
At the Doral resort last weekend, steps were being taken to prevent infections, even as many visitors and some staff members did not wear masks — something the president himself has been reluctant to do in public.
Ordering a meal at the poolside restaurant required a cellphone, as no menus were given out. Tables and chaise longues were disinfected between guests. On the golf courses, there were no ball-washers, coolers, or ice and water machines, among other changes.
Just as their father has, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who run the family business, have eagerly awaited the lifting of shutdown mandates in Florida and elsewhere. “At some point you have to open back up our country,” Eric Trump told Fox News on Saturday, when he was in Oklahoma for his father’s reelection rally.
The financial strain of the shutdowns on the Trump Organization has been real. The company’s revenue from its hotel operations is way down this year, and it recently requested a rent abatement from Palm Beach County, where the Trumps operate two golf courses on county land. It also negotiated with Deutsche Bank to reduce or delay its payments on loans from the bank, including about $125 million the Trump Organization borrowed when it was buying Doral in 2012, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
The bank agreed to a break, in line with those offered to other borrowers, but the Trump Organization concluded that the offer was not worth taking and turned it down, the people said.
Eric Trump, in an interview, said the company would “come out as strong” because it had relatively little debt and steady revenue from office buildings. The company also cut personnel and other costs at its hotels.
“I had to make some of the worst decisions hopefully that I’ll ever have to make in my life,” he said, referring to furloughs and layoffs.
Nationally, the company and entities associated with it filed notifications with state officials in March that it intended to lay off or furlough at least 1,500 employees. Notices were also sent to some of those employees, including at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, that their health insurance was being cut off.
Congress included language in a federal relief package that prohibited the Trump family from taking part in assistance programs controlled by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and the company decided not to seek loans from the Small Business Administration.
The four golf courses at Doral have been busy, with much of the play from members who live in the Miami area. But the resort’s 643-room hotel, which had seen declines in sales after Donald Trump was elected, continues to face low room occupancy along with the broader hotel industry.
Rooms can be booked for about $100, less than the standard rate in the summer offseason in recent years. Two-thirds of Miami-area hotel rooms were vacant as of the second week of June, according to STR, which tracks industry performance.
With the reopening Monday of the Trump Organization’s Ferry Point golf course in the Bronx, all of the 20 Trump properties in the United States are up and running again, at least in part; even the tasting room at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, is once again welcoming visitors.
The president has done his part to raise the profile of his properties. He returned in recent weeks to courses in New Jersey and Virginia after 2 1/2 months without playing golf, the longest break since he became president. And last month, as his company announced the reopening of its Los Angeles course, Trump celebrated in a post on Twitter.
“So great to see our Country starting to open up again!” he wrote.
Even so, the Trump family operations are only partly back in business.
In Washington, the lobby at the hotel that served as a magnet for lobbyists and Trump administration officials remains closed, as does BLT Prime, the high-end restaurant at the hotel. The main restaurants at Trump hotels in New York, Hawaii, Miami and Chicago also are still closed.
“Since the pandemic began, we have had to make many difficult decisions,” Mickael Damelincourt, the managing director of the Washington hotel, said in a letter last month to employees.
Internationally, the family’s hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia, remains closed. Trump Doonbeg, the golf resort in Ireland, is also closed, and the hotel there is not accepting reservations online until mid-July. Trump Dubai, a golf club in the United Arab Emirates, is open, but players are required to wear masks, even when on the golf course, the website says.
As they reopen, some Trump properties have drawn people protesting police brutality and the president’s statements about demonstrators after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
“We wanted to bring this to his doorstep because we see how he speaks in discriminatory and inflammatory language,” said Nathalie Polo, 23, who led a protest outside the Doral property this month. “I felt like it was important to do something, and specifically, do something that might grab his attention.”
On Saturday, a lawyer dressed as the grim reaper was outside the Doral hotel. The lawyer, Daniel Uhlfelder, said he opposed the handling of the pandemic by the president and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who has followed Trump’s lead in pushing for a rapid return to business-as-usual even as the virus continues to spread.
“He is the model messenger of misinformation,” Uhlfelder said of Trump. “We have been fighting for several months to get Florida to do the right thing.”
Experts say it is possible for businesses like Trump National Doral to operate safely, but they also acknowledge that the president’s properties present a special case.
“The bottom line is, can a leader lead by example?” said Dr. Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert with Florida International University who helped design Miami-Dade County’s safety protocols for businesses. “That’s what needs to happen at every type of business — wear a mask, practice hygiene, social distance.”
When the president recently visited his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, while in the area to speak at the West Point graduation ceremony, temperature checks were required, but only when he was on the property, a person familiar with the situation said. There is no requirement that golfers or guests at Bedminster wear masks, and almost no one has done so, other than food service employees, the person said.

Playwright Kermit Frazier has been sticking close to home, so it’s fortuitous that the protests have come to him — Black Lives Matter demonstrations at Grand Army Plaza and outside the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, which he can see through the front window of his apartment in Park Slope.
Yet Frazier, whose little-known first play, “Kernel of Sanity,” will get a profile boost Thursday night when it leads off the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Paula Vogel’s new online reading series, hasn’t headed out to march. The author of 25 works for the stage — including a docudrama about the covered-up police killing of a young black man in 1958 Milwaukee, which Frazier noted comes to mind “every time we get into this kind of situation” — has poured his activism straight into his writing.
“That’s how I participate,” he said by phone on Juneteenth, then instantly checked himself. “Most people say that’s not enough. The writers are out in the street. Everyone’s out in the street.”
Not everyone is under orders from their two grown daughters to be vigilant about the pandemic, though. Frazier is, and he has tiny grandchildren he wants to see.
So at 74, he starts his days with a long, early-morning masked speed-walk through Prospect Park, then stays in to avoid the crowds — and, lately, to gear up for the reappearance of “Kernel of Sanity,” a psychological drama he wrote in 1978 when he was just out of the graduate acting program at New York University, performing in a downtown revival of “Native Son.”
In “Kernel of Sanity,” a young Black actor named Roger shares a bit of Frazier’s résumé. Fresh off the same small part in seemingly the same production of “Native Son,” Roger pays a surprise visit to Frank, a self-involved older white actor who starred a few years earlier in a New York production of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Roger, playing an aide, would watch Frank from the wings.
Written some months after Frazier had an acting experience that made him feel used, “Kernel” is about marginalization and predation, white privilege and long-simmering rage. Even in the drama that unfolds between Roger and Frank, the white guy has by far the largest role.
“There’s no space for Roger,” Frazier said. “Sometimes white people take up all the air in the room. How do you get recognized? How do you navigate that?”
To Vogel, an ardent advocate of “Kernel” since she plucked it from a slush pile as a 27-year-old secretary to the artistic director at the American Place Theater, it is a work that examines racism in the theater, and that still holds the charge it had for her when she first read it straight through, electrified.
“I encountered a play that for the first time made me see what whiteness was,” she said.
Thus her urgent elevating of it now in what she has dubbed the Bard at the Gate series of overlooked plays, in a taped reading that will star Josh Hamilton as Frank, Matthew Hancock as Roger and Abigail Breslin as Rita, Frank’s girlfriend. “Kernel” will be followed by three other plays in a series united by themes of race and gender: Meg Miroshnik’s “The Droll” on July 15, then Eisa Davis’ “Bulrusher” and Dan LeFranc’s “Origin Story,” with dates to be announced.
A Pulitzer winner for “How I Learned to Drive,” Vogel, 68, is a vocal champion of scripts she loves, and the series is her way of furthering that. But she and Frazier are acquaintances rather than friends, and he had no idea she was pushing “Kernel” until she mentioned it in The Village Voice in 2003. “Kernel” by then was 25 and hadn’t been staged professionally.
Then again, its first reading — at Williamstown Theater Festival in the summer of 1978, when Frazier was a member of the acting company — pointed to a structural obstacle in the mainstream American theater. As the playwright, Frazier didn’t want to be in the reading, but he was the only Black actor there. So the first time he heard his play, it was with an all-white cast.
The next summer, artistic director Lloyd Richards brought “Kernel” to the National Playwrights Conference for development, on a roster that included David Henry Hwang’s “F.O.B.” and John Pielmeier’s “Agnes of God.” Still, Frazier’s first professionally produced play was “Shadows and Echoes” in 1981, with a cast that included S. Epatha Merkerson.
That was when he realized, with some relief, that he could stay in the theater without having to be an actor. He had come late to the stage anyway, after going to college and graduate school for English. During an Air Force stint in Wichita Falls, Texas — “Larry McMurtry territory,” he calls it — he fell in with the Backdoor Theater, a local amateur troupe, for lack of other things to do.
Already set on a path toward teaching, he only auditioned for NYU because a couple of Texas friends urged him to. In 1974, at 28, he started acting school. Gregg Daniel, the director of Thursday’s “Kernel” reading, was a classmate.
On the phone the other day, Frazier mentioned that he was born in 1946, the same year as “George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and the dummy who’s president now,” which is one way of suggesting the arc of a life.
Here is another. At NYU, he studied with Olympia Dukakis. Ron Van Lieu directed him in “Othello.” Kristin Linklater, his voice teacher, nursed her infant son, Hamish, while she listened to the class. In the years that followed, Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson and Laurence Fishburne were all in readings of Frazier’s early work.
It has always been difficult for him to get his plays produced, though he said most of them have been. In the ’90s, he segued to television writing, notably for the children’s crime-solving series, “Ghostwriter.” Then came academia. Retired from teaching three years ago and returned to writing full time, he is a professor emeritus at Adelphi University.
In between, in 2009, “Kernel” was staged by Woodie King Jr.’s New Federal Theater. Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Rachel Saltz detected mystery in it, but Marilyn Stasio, in Variety, gave it a furious pan.
Then, mid-lockdown, came an email from Vogel, proposing the reading.
In preparation, she has been catching up on the rest of his catalog, which includes “An American Journey,” written with John Leicht and based on the police killing of Daniel Bell; and “Modern Minstrelsy,” about what Frazier calls “the contentious relationship between African Americans and Irish Americans.”
Much of the stuff of his plays is the stuff of living while Black, and he finds it strange to see the wider culture just waking up to the history of racism that he has long known.
As for the theater, he thinks it’s past time that it open its eyes.
“Theater has to be about truth,” he said. “And theater has to live up to the origin of the word theater: ‘the seeing space.’ If we’re not allowed to see, then what’s the point?”

Atlanta Mourns Rayshard Brooks in a Sanctuary Imbued With Civil Rights History [With graphic(s)]

ATLANTA — Through generations of turmoil and tension, Ebenezer Baptist Church has been where many African Americans in Atlanta have gathered to find comfort in their faith and in one another.
During the fight for civil rights, it had been the pastoral home of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., becoming known as “America’s Freedom Church.”
And on Tuesday afternoon, it will serve as a stage in the latest chapter of the nation’s grappling over racial inequality and injustice, with the funeral of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man who was fatally shot by the Atlanta police.
“Rayshard Brooks wasn’t just running from the police,” the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer and a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, will say in his sermon at the service, according to an excerpt released to The Associated Press.
“He was running from a system that makes slaves out of people,” he said, referring to Brooks’ past interactions with the criminal justice system. He was on probation and faced a return to prison if arrested that night. “A system that doesn’t give ordinary people who’ve made mistakes a second chance, a real shot at redemption.”
Brooks, 27, was killed on June 12 as tensions had already boiled over across the country after George Floyd died in May in the custody of the Minneapolis police. The killings yet again inflamed the long-standing tensions between minority communities and law enforcement, and also expanded into a larger grappling over the racial divides that figure into almost every facet of American life.
The costs of Brooks’ funeral are being covered by Tyler Perry, the entertainment mogul who is a prominent figure in Atlanta, family representatives said. King’s daughter, Bernice King, is also expected to speak, along with friends and relatives.
The funeral, with the sanctuary closed to the public, comes after a viewing Monday that drew a vast crowd on a stormy afternoon, with some wearing T-shirts that said “Justice for Rayshard Brooks” as they waited in line to pay their respects.
Brooks was killed after two police officers were called to a Wendy’s where, the authorities said, Brooks had fallen asleep in the drive-thru.
As the officers moved to arrest Brooks, he hit an officer, grabbed the other officer’s Taser, fired it, and took off running. One of the officers, Garrett Rolfe, discharged his own Taser and reached for his 9-millimeter Glock handgun as Brooks turned and discharged the stolen Taser again. Rolfe fired, striking Brooks twice in the back.
Within hours, Rolfe was fired from the Police Department, and the city’s police chief, Erika Shields, resigned. Several days later, the Fulton County district attorney, Paul L. Howard Jr., announced that Rolfe was being charged with 11 counts, including felony murder and aggravated assault. The other officer, Devin Brosnan, who was placed on administrative duty, was charged with aggravated assault and violating his oath as an officer.
“My uncle did not die in vain,” Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece, said in a recent news conference, noting how her uncle had become part of a larger group known by the country for how they died.
“His life mattered,” she said. “George Floyd’s life mattered. Breonna Taylor’s life mattered. Michael Brown’s life mattered. Sandra Bland’s life mattered. I’m not only asking the city of Atlanta to stand with us. I’m asking for everyone in this nation to stand with us as we seek justice for Rayshard.”

‘The Future Looks Bleak’: The Pandemic Ravages Medical Tourism [With graphic(s)]

Over the past several years, hospitals began to play innkeeper to open the door to more elective surgery, which is the lifeblood of their revenue.
They developed hotels near their operating rooms where patients, who often came from overseas for specialized treatments, could recover comfortably. Expanding into the hospitality business also allowed health care providers to avoid the high costs of being hosts themselves.
But as with so much else, the coronavirus pandemic has devastated medical tourism. To allow doctors to focus on emergencies, hospitals have canceled hip replacements and tummy tucks, while flight bans have grounded many foreign visitors.
Compounding the decline, multiday protests in May and June against police brutality, set off by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, have also given travelers pause, depriving hospitals of some of their best-paying customers, according to those who work in the industry.
“Unfortunately, the future looks bleak,” said Trey Hulsey, a co-founder of Hayakoum, a 3-year-old service that handles travel arrangements for patients from the Middle East bound for hospitals in Boston, Houston and Philadelphia. “It’s just been one blow after another.”
Yet hospitals, whose costs have mounted as the pandemic dragged on, may have little choice but to revive the sector, according to some developers, who are forging ahead despite the uncertainty.
In Miami, for instance, plans are in motion for Legacy Hotel and Residences, a mixed-use tower from the developer Royal Palm Companies that is taking the hospital-hotel concept in a different direction.
Instead of situating its 256-room hotel and 100,000-square-foot hospital side by side, as might be the case on some campuses, Legacy sandwiches the two entities into a single 680-foot high-rise the shape of a stapler.
Also included in the nearly $500 million project, which is set to break ground this fall as part of the Miami Worldcenter mega-development, are condos, a full-floor fitness center and spa, shops, bars and restaurants.
Someone who goes to the tower looking to, say, replace a damaged knee would undergo surgery in the Center for Health and Performance, a 10-level facility at the tower’s base. Then, after being wheeled down halls and into a private elevator, the patient would begin a stay of a week or so in a hotel room above.
Sixteen suites with nurse service will be available for those needing greater attention, although patients with fewer needs will stay in typical hotel rooms, said Daniel Kodsi, chief executive of Royal Palm, a co-developer of Paramount Miami Worldcenter, a condo tower down the street.
The pandemic has not halted sales of Legacy’s 274 condos, whose studios start at $300,000, but it has delayed the selection of an operator for Legacy’s $60 million hospital, which Royal Palm prefers to call a “medical center” because it will lack an emergency room and offer only outpatient procedures.
Developers say the distinction is crucial. Some hotel guests are bound to feel uneasy about sharing space with people who have spent time in a hospital — a concern amplified by the spread of the coronavirus — even if the discharged patients pose little risk of infectious disease.
“You’re in a luxury hotel,” Kodsi said. “You don’t want to be around people who are dying.”
Still, as the pandemic intensified, Legacy made changes to allay fears. A medical-grade air-filtration system, previously planned just for the hospital, will now be used for the entire tower.
Plus, robotic cleaning devices that use ultraviolet light, once envisioned solely for operating rooms, will be deployed to disinfect gathering areas in the hotel and condo sections, Royal Palm said. And doors throughout the tower are being reconfigured to allow phones or voice commands to open them remotely, so no patient or guest has to touch knobs or handles.
Because the Legacy will offer such a germ-reduced environment, as well as services like medical checkups that can be reached by an elevator ride, the multifunction tower could also be a good candidate for a quarantine destination, should a pandemic hit again, said Stephen Watson, Royal Palm’s chief strategic officer for medical development.
“We are bringing the health care to hospitality, and the hospitality to health care,” Watson said.
Not all medical tourists arrive from abroad. Deprived of specialized care by the closing of rural hospitals, they come from within the United States, too. And a Hyatt opening next month in Chicago’s hospital-packed medical district is expected to serve some of them.
Offering 210 rooms, for both short- and long-term stays, the new hotel is part of a $90 million conversion of a column-lined 1914 former hospital that is also to feature a medical museum. The project is being overseen by a team led by Murphy Development Group, which developed a similarly patient-focused property, a 276-room Holiday Inn at the Cleveland Clinic, in 2016.
The plunge in elective surgery this spring has hollowed out the Cleveland property, said John T. Murphy, the firm’s chief executive. About the only guests who have been around in recent months are visiting health care workers.
But even without long lines of plastic-surgery seekers, hotels can be vital partners for hospitals, providing extra beds during a public-health crisis, even if there was not always a need for surplus cots this time around.
“Hotels make a ton of sense from a logistical perspective,” Murphy said.
From a financial perspective, hotels have been a smart bet, as elective surgery accounts for more than one-third of all spending at some major hospitals, according to David G. Vequist IV, founder of Center for Medical Tourism Research, a group based in San Antonio that was founded in 2008.
And as hospitals experienced a drop in demand in recent years because of high deductibles and other factors, offsetting the difference with deep-pocketed medical tourists was considered a priority, Vequist said.
Institutions with global recognition have been the most likely to embrace the trend, like Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, although even Sanford USD Medical Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has seen the value in controlling the lodging experience for its patients. It has invested in an outpost of Home2Suites, a Hilton brand, across from its campus.
South America is the point of origin for many patients at Baptist Hospital of Miami, a 799-bed facility known for cancer care that last year razed a low-slung, dated hotel to make way for a Hilton Miami Dadeland, which has 186 rooms, starting at $100 a night, plus a farm-to-table restaurant. A van shuttles patients around Baptist’s 100-acre campus in the Kendall neighborhood. The hospital declined to say how much it cost to develop the hotel.
“The international piece was growing, and we were constantly arranging for area hotels and apartments,” said Ana Lopez-Blázquez, an executive vice president at Baptist Health South Florida, which owns the Miami hospital. “We want to be focused on the entire patient experience.”
Success does not entirely depend on patients. The typical ratio of medical tourists to other travelers is about 50-50 at the hotel, which has 80% occupancy, Lopez-Blázquez said. But this spring, occupancy plummeted to 30%, she added, and almost all the guests had a Baptist connection.
Still, things might have been worse. Most Miami-Dade hotels were forced to shut down this spring, but Baptist’s Hilton, considered essential, stayed open.
What also makes the hotel different, Baptist says, is that a hospital is in charge. When hotel employees were struggling to find protective gear, Baptist came up with the proper equipment. Similarly, steps taken to safeguard guests like plastic guards at the check-in desk and a reconfigured pool entrance, to ensure social distancing, are up to medical standards as well.
“I think the sensitivity is there because the owner is a health care organization,” Lopez-Blázquez said, “so there is really no debate.”

Full text: As calls to defund the police grow around the country, public officials and advocacy groups in recent weeks have proposed major cuts to the New York City Police Department, the nation's largest and most expensive force.
The various proposals call for removing millions, if not more, from the Police Department's budget starting July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year. None, however, move to completely defund the department, whose spending has steadily risen each year.
In its 2019 fiscal year, the Police Department spent nearly $ 6 billion, which amounted to about 6 percent of the city's $ 95 billion total spending.
Nearly 90 percent of the department's spending went toward paying personnel, including salaries, overtime and other benefits like shift differentials for more than 36,000 uniformed and 15,000 civilian positions. The average base pay for officers was nearly $ 69,000, but with overtime and additional pay, they could take home more than $ 90,000. For some higher ranks, total pay reached more than $ 200,000.
The rest of the spending went to other expenses like supplies and contractual services.
If a proposal is approved that cuts the department's budget substantially, then regardless of where such cuts appear, they will almost certainly require significantly reducing the number of officers and staff on payroll.
Among the proposals, a plan from the city comptroller spreads smaller cuts to the department over four years. A coalition within the City Council earlier this month proposed an unprecedented $ 1 billion cut from the budget in the 2021 fiscal year. And last week , the Communities United for Police Reform, an advocacy group, went further, calling for cuts of more than $ 1 billion. All seek to redirect funds to various community initiatives.
The deadline for the City Council to approve the city's 2021 fiscal year budget is July 1.
In the current fiscal year, the Police Department had a $ 5.6 billion budget, the same amount that the City Council earlier this year had anticipated would be set aside for 2021.
Neither the City Council nor Mayor Bill de Blasio has specified exactly which parts of the police budget might see cuts. Though the mayor has pledged to cut funding, his press secretary indicated that he rejected the City Council's proposal to slash $ 1 billion.
Doug Turetsky, the chief of staff and communications director in the city's Independent Budget Office, said it would take a lot of layoffs to reach that amount in cuts, possibly more than would be politically feasible. "To take a billion off, I mean, that's a lot. Obviously we're in a pretty unique political time right now," Mr. Turetsky said. "You really only get to that level by cutting a fair number of cops. I don't know if it's going to happen."
Nationwide calls for defunding police forces have taken on added intensity in recent weeks in the wake of white officers killing black men, including George Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta. Defunding has become a rallying cry at many of the protests over racial inequality and police brutality that have followed the killings.
Activists and reformers argue that cutting funds and staff from police departments would allow for other kinds of programs to support safety and well-being. "There's a move to not just defund and dismantle the police but to pour those resources back into communities that need more support and more opportunities," said Nancy La Vigne, an expert in criminal justice policy at the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center.
Not everyone is as optimistic. Maria Haberfeld, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who studies law enforcement, said that the current proposals for New York do not have enough expert input. In her view, fewer officers would result in slower response times to violent crime, while not addressing underlying issues. "These proposals are utopian at best, if I want to be positive about it, and if I want to be more negative, are just ridiculous," she said.
The Police Department's spending is broken into 16 program areas in the city's financial reports. In 15 out of the 16, costs related to personnel -- such as salary, overtime and benefits -- made up more than half of that area's spending in 2019.
In addition to these 16 program areas, spending reports specifically note two types of spending that are not funded by the city: $ 159 million in federal grants for security and counterterrorism, and $ 49 million for overtime for events where the officers serve as security and crowd control forces who are reimbursed by state, federal or private entities. These expenses are part of the total money that the department spent in 2019, but they are recorded separately.
Ultimately, the Police Department's operating expenses are a fraction of its total cost for the city -- something the defunding proposals also seek to limit.
According to a report from the mayor's office, the total amount the city spent on all police or police-related costs in 2018 was $ 10.6 billion. That was on top of $ 230 million in settlements the city also paid for personal injury and property damage claims against the Police Department, more than a fifth of the city's total claim payouts for that year.

New York Museum to Remove Roosevelt Statue: [National Desk]

Author: Pogrebin, Robin

Full text: The equestrian memorial to Theodore Roosevelt has long prompted objections as a symbol of colonialism and racism.
The bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt, on horseback and flanked by a Native American man and an African man, which has presided over the entrance to the American Museum of Natural History in New York since 1940, is coming down.
The decision, proposed by the museum and agreed to by New York City, which owns the building and property, came after years of objections from activists and at a time when the killing of George Floyd has initiated an urgent nationwide conversation about racism.
For many, the equestrian statue at the museum's Central Park West entrance has come to symbolize a painful legacy of colonial expansion and racial discrimination.
"Over the last few weeks, our museum community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd," the museum's president, Ellen V. Futter, said in an interview. "We have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism."
Ms. Futter made clear that the museum's decision was based on the statue itself -- namely its "hierarchical composition"--- and not on Roosevelt, whom the museum continues to honor as "a pioneering conservationist."
"Simply put," she added, "the time has come to move it."
The museum took action amid a heated national debate over the appropriateness of statues or monuments that first focused on Confederate symbols like Robert E. Lee and has now moved on to a wider arc of figures, from Christopher Columbus to Winston Churchill.
Last week alone, a crowd set fire to a statue of George Washington in Portland, Ore., before pulling it to the ground. Gunfire broke out during a protest in Albuquerque to demand the removal of a statue of Juan de Oñate, the despotic conquistador of New Mexico. And New York City Council members demanded that a statue of Thomas Jefferson be removed from City Hall.
In many of those cases, the calls for removal were made by protesters who say the images are too offensive to stand as monuments to American history. The decision about the Roosevelt statue is different, made by a museum that, like others, had previously defended -- and preserved -- such portraits as relics of their time that however objectionable, could perhaps serve to educate. It was then seconded by the city, which had the final say.
"The American Museum of Natural History has asked to remove the Theodore Roosevelt statue because it explicitly depicts Black and Indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior," Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. "The City supports the Museum's request. It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue."
When the monument will be taken down, where it will go and what, if anything, will replace it, remain undetermined, officials said.
A Roosevelt family member released a statement approving the removal.
"The world does not need statues, relics of another age, that reflect neither the values of the person they intend to honor nor the values of equality and justice," said Theodore Roosevelt IV, age 77, a great-grandson of the 26th president and a museum trustee. "The composition of the Equestrian Statue does not reflect Theodore Roosevelt's legacy. It is time to move the statue and move forward."
In a compensatory gesture, the museum is naming its Hall of Biodiversity for Roosevelt "in recognition of his conservation legacy," Ms. Futter said.
The president's father, Theodore Roosevelt Sr., was a founding member of the institution; its charter was signed in his home. Roosevelt's childhood excavations were among the museum's first artifacts. New York's state legislature in 1920 chose the museum as the site to memorialize the former president. The museum already has several spaces named after Roosevelt, including Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall, the Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda and Theodore Roosevelt Park outside. Critics, though, have pointed to President Roosevelt's opinions about racial hierarchy, his support of eugenics theories and his pivotal role in the Spanish-American War. Some see Roosevelt as an imperialist who led fighting in the Caribbean that ultimately resulted in American expansion into colonies there and in the Pacific including Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam, Cuba and the Philippines.
A nationalist, Roosevelt, in his later years became overtly racist, historians say, endorsing sterilization of the poor and the intellectually disabled.
The statue -- created by the American sculptor James Earle Fraser -- was one of four memorials in New York that a city commission reconsidered in 2017, ultimately deciding after a split decision to leave the statue in place and to add context.
The museum tried to add that context with an exhibition last year, "Addressing the Statue," which explored its design and installation, the inclusion of the figures walking beside Roosevelt and Roosevelt's racism. The museum also examined its own potential complicity, in particular its exhibitions on eugenics in the early 20th century.
"I'm glad to see it go," said Mabel O. Wilson, a Columbia University professor who served on the city commission to reconsider the statue and was consulted on the exhibition.
"The depiction of the Indigenous and the African trailing behind Roosevelt, who is strong and virile," she added, "was clearly a narrative of white racial superiority and domination."
The exhibition was partly a response to the defacing of the statue by protesters, who in 2017 splashed red liquid representing blood over the statue's base. The protesters, who identified themselves as members of the Monument Removal Brigade, later published a statement on the internet calling for its removal as an emblem of "patriarchy, white supremacy and settler-colonialism."
"Now the statue is bleeding," the statement said. "We did not make it bleed. It is bloody at its very foundation."
The group also said the museum should "rethink its cultural halls regarding the colonial mentality behind them."
At the time, the museum said complaints should be channeled through Mayor de Blasio's commission to review city monuments and that the museum was planning to update its exhibits. The institution has since undertaken a renovation of its North West Coast Hall in consultation with Native nations from the North West Coast of Canada and Alaska.
In January, the museum also moved the Northwest Coast Great Canoe from its 77th Street entrance into that hall, to better contextualize it. The museum's Old New York diorama, which includes a stereotypical depiction of Lenape leaders, now has captions explaining why the display is offensive.
Mayor de Blasio has made a point of rethinking public monuments to honor more women and people of color -- an undertaking led largely by his wife, Chirlane McCray, and the She Built NYC commission. But these efforts have also been controversial, given complaints about the transparency of the process and the public figures who have been excluded, namely Mother Cabrini, a patron saint of immigrants who had drawn the most nominations in a survey of New Yorkers.
On Friday, the Mayor announced that Ms. McCray would lead a Racial Justice and Reconciliation Commission whose brief would include reviewing the monuments in the city that were deemed racist.
Though the debates over many of these statues have been marked by rancor, the Natural History Museum seems unconflicted about removing the Roosevelt monument that has greeted its visitors for so long.
"We believe that moving the statue can be a symbol of progress in our commitment to build and sustain an inclusive and equitable society," Ms. Futter said. "Our view has been evolving. This moment crystallized our thinking and galvanized us to action."
Many say the statue of Theodore Roosevelt valorizes colonial expansion and a racist hierarchy. (A1); A police officer stood watch on Friday at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAITLIN OCHS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A19)

Why Obsessive K-Pop Fans Are Turning Toward Political Activism [With graphic(s)]

In certain corners of the internet, the organizing prowess of K-pop fans — the typically young and diverse international enthusiasts of Korean pop music who congregate daily on social media — has long been the stuff of legend: Through coordinated group action, so-called fan armies of acts like BTS and Blackpink make sure that their favorite idols are trending topics who lead the music charts and sell out stadiums from South Korea to the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles and Citi Field in New York.
Now, amid a pandemic, a forthcoming presidential election and inescapable conversations about race, this loose collective of digital warriors is trying to exert its influence in a new realm: the American political arena.
Spurred at first by the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests around the world, K-pop stans made themselves known outside of music circles this weekend, when some took credit for helping to inflate expectations for President Donald Trump’s rally in Oklahoma by reserving tickets they had no plans to use. But while the Trump campaign has denied that the pointed prank affected rally attendance, blaming protesters and the news media instead, the call to action in K-pop circles revealed a growing realization that fans’ efficient social-media tactics for fundraising or making a song go viral can also be used for political activism.
In recent weeks, K-pop devotees — who use Twitter as a home base but proliferate across TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms — have spammed a birthday card for Trump, disrupted a Dallas police app seeking intelligence on protesters and flooded would-be white supremacist hashtags, while also announcing that they had matched a $1 million donation from BTS for Black Lives Matter groups. And in keeping with the growing popularity of K-pop in the United States, many of these budding digital activists may also be U.S. citizens, according to experts.
“The English-speaking K-pop fans who are getting involved in this, who are up on these issues, these are not foreigners,” said CedarBough Saeji, an academic who studies K-pop fan culture. “These are Americans.”
“That these young, socially progressive, outward-looking people who are really adept at using these online platforms — who are stuck at home and online even more because of COVID-19 — that these people are doing political things is not surprising,” added Saeji, a visiting assistant professor of East Asian culture at Indiana University Bloomington. “These are young people who are completely willing to learn about a new culture to follow their interest in some pop-culture product. These are exactly the kind of people who are the opposite of the Trump audience that claps when he disses ‘Parasite’ and says that ‘Gone With the Wind’ is a real movie.”
In the days since Trump’s rally in Tulsa, no evidence has emerged that South Korean fans of K-pop were involved in any significant way in the “no-show” campaign. South Korean news media instead relayed American reports from Tulsa, treating the episode mainly as a gag by teenage fans of K-pop and TikTok users in the United States.
South Koreans tend to follow U.S. elections closely because they could affect alliance relations between Washington and Seoul and U.S. policy on North Korea. But they generally remain wary of taking sides in U.S. politics. Trump has been quite popular among liberal South Koreans, including young people, by raising hopes that his diplomacy with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, might produce a breakthrough in long-stalled talks on ending the North’s nuclear threat and establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.
On Monday, some South Koreans responded to the news from Tulsa by expressing concern about how Trump might react. “Why does K-pop meddle in an American political dispute,” wrote one reader of a local newspaper article about the rally.
But while K-pop culture in South Korea is a largely apolitical mainstream concern, leaving fan armies to focus on boosting album sales and propping up their idols, the community’s position as a subculture in the United States may lend itself to more radical gestures, especially at a time of increased political polarization.
“Although K-pop’s message is not necessarily political in an overt sense, they are often about empowerment and self-confidence,” said the author of the “Ask a Korean!” blog, who uses the pen name T.K. Park. “Lots of first-time K-pop fans, for example, got into BTS because the group’s message of ‘love yourself’ strongly resonated with them.” And because such content has attracted an audience made up largely of women and people of color, Park added, “this message pushes them to be more expressive with every aspect of their lives, including politics.”
They had also already honed the necessary skills. “K-pop fans learned how to organize through their fandom,” Park said. “K-pop is a digital-native music,” he added, and South Korea’s early adoption of nationwide broadband service “made Korean pop music respond to the demands of the internet, and also made K-pop’s fandom the most sophisticated actors in the digital sphere.” He pointed to the near-constant campaigns to flood radio stations with song requests or sell out concert tickets in a matter of minutes as a training ground: “All of these activities can be translated into politics very easily.”
Nicole Santero, a fan and Ph.D. student with a focus on the BTS Army who also runs the data-focused @ResearchBTS account, found that in May, there were only two days when a term related to the group was not trending worldwide on Twitter.
“Sometimes they don’t even mean to trend, but there’s so many of them that sometimes they accidentally trend random words,” she said. “They’re really, really passionate people who just fight for what they love. Those characteristics translate well when you look at social issues.”
A spokeswoman for Twitter said that K-pop was the most tweeted about music genre worldwide, with more than 6.1 billion tweets in 2019, an increase of 15% from the year before. BTS was the most tweeted about artist for the last three years, the company added. TikTok and Facebook declined to provide data.
The recent turn toward political activism in the United States also follows a concerted effort by K-pop fans in recent years to make positive change en masse, in part as a reaction to the groups’ reputations as superficial, silly and even menacing mobs. Like the most fervent fan bases of American pop stars — including Justin Bieber’s Beliebers, Beyoncé’s BeyHive or Nicki Minaj’s Barbz, known collectively as “stans” after the Eminem song about an obsessive stalker — K-pop followers have been accused of harassment for piling onto critics or rivals. In South Korea, they have also been viewed as overly fawning, and even cultlike, banding together, for instance, to buy presents like luxury watches for famous singers.
But these days, philanthropic donations to uncontroversial causes like the poor, the old or the terminally ill — often in made in the name of chosen artists — are more common. “This was a way to remake fandom in the eyes of the public,” Saeji said.
Black Lives Matter in particular may have represented an urgent cause to K-pop fans given the artists’ debt to hip-hop culture and black music, with groups like BTS having been accused in the past of cultural appropriation. “Artists, directors, writers, dancers, designers, producers, stylists in the K-pop industry are all inspired by black culture whether they acknowledge it or not,” South Korean singer and rapper CL wrote recently on Instagram.
“You have K-pop fans educating other K-pop fans about this,” Saeji said, noting the overarching enthusiasm across subjects both serious and playful. “You can go on K-pop Twitter and you will see somebody post about Black Lives Matter and then 10 minutes later post something about the cutest idol that they are totally fan-girling over. They don’t see a contradiction there.
“What’s really important about this entire thing is that young people are seeing their political power, they are flexing, and they are feeling it,” she added. “And you know what they are going to do next? They are going to vote. These K-pop fans are not feeling cynical right now. They are feeling empowered.”

Two people were shot dead and seven others injured by gunfire early Monday during a gathering in Charlotte, North Carolina, authorities said.
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said in a statement that about five other people were injured by vehicles at the scene.
Officers were responding to a call for one of those injuries when the gunfire began.
The gunfire broke out at what appeared to be a multiday block party connected to Juneteenth — the holiday, celebrated Friday, that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States.
The police department said preliminary information indicated that several people discharged dozens of shots into a crowd that was gathered in the area, a busy commercial street north of the central business district.
Videos posted online by people at the scene captured the sound of dozens of gunshots as some fled the area and others worked to help those injured.

One recent afternoon, while washing his car, Greg Reese, a white stay-at-home dad in Campton, Kentucky, peeled off the Confederate flag magnet he had placed on its trunk six years earlier. He did not put it back on.
It was a small act for which he expected no accolades. It should not have taken the police killing of George Floyd, Reese knew, to face what he had long known to be true, that the flag he had grown up thinking of as “a beautiful trophy” was “a symbol of hate, and it’s obviously wrong to glorify it.”
The sustained outcry over Floyd’s death has compelled many white Americans to acknowledge the anti-Black racism that is prevalent in the United States — and to perhaps even examine their own culpability for it. It is as if the ability of white people to collectively ignore the everyday experience of Black people has been short-circuited, at least for now.
Large numbers of white Americans have attended racial justice demonstrations, purchased books about racial inequality and registered for webinars on how to raise children who are anti-racist. Some have asked themselves pointed questions, like how much professional advantage they have garnered from being white and whether they would willingly cede it if they could. Others are going to tattoo parlors to cover up images of Confederate flags, swastikas and Ku Klux Klan symbols on their bodies.
It is hard to know how deep or wide these responses run — and whether they are the result of pressure from peers to appear tolerant or if meaningful action will follow. Anti-racism activists have specified concerns that are not about only symbols or slurs but entire systems governing how Americans live.
Some of the same communities where white liberals have been marching with Black Lives Matter signs have seen steep resistance to efforts to integrate public schools and neighborhoods. And what some consider a profound questioning of white supremacy to others can seem laughably little and unconscionably late. The most frustrating thing about this moment, said Jeremy O. Harris, a playwright and the writer of “Slave Play,” is “listening to white people say this is the first time they realize how bad it is.”
In interviews, some white Americans admitted that even the process of reflecting on racism underscored for them how little they grasp the everyday experience of being Black in America.
Research shows there is scant interpersonal contact between white and Black Americans: 1 in 5 white respondents to a poll from the Public Religion Research Institute last year said that they rarely or ever had an interaction with someone of a different race. In a 2013 study by the same group, a nonpartisan nonprofit, respondents were asked to identify the race of as many as seven people with whom they had discussed important matters in the six months before the survey. Among white respondents, 75% named only white individuals as their core friendship network.
“Many white Americans have chosen places to live, places to send their children to school, places to vacation, jobs to pursue, in ways that allow them to avoid thinking about racial inequality,” said Jennifer Chudy, a political scientist at Wellesley College. Her research suggests that only 1 in 5 white Americans consistently express high levels of sympathy about racial discrimination against Black Americans.
The combination of the coronavirus pandemic, economic collapse and a bungled emergency response by the Trump administration indirectly laid the foundation for the furor among white Americans that followed the cellphone video of Floyd’s death.
“All of that, I believe, is converging at this point to make people, white people in particular, think through America,” said Carol Anderson, author of “White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide” and a professor of African American studies at Emory University. “What kind of nation is this, that can be comfortable with a police officer kneeling on someone’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds? And when you start asking that question, then all of the kinds of narratives and shibboleths begin to quake.”
It was the words of Floyd’s daughter, Reese said, that propelled him to join activist group Southern Crossroads and create a “Rednecks for Black Lives” decal that he hopes will appeal to politically conservative friends and neighbors. The group’s leaders say that majority-white, working-class communities like Reese’s stand to benefit themselves from forming multiracial alliances.
“The one thing that flipped me and made me really want to do something was when that baby said that her daddy changed the world,” said Reese, referring to comments by Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna. “And I want to make that true. I want that baby’s words to come true.”
A shift in the priorities of white Americans regarding racial equality, race scholars said, is critical to achieving it. In the first two weeks of coast-to-coast protests, support for Black Lives Matter increased by nearly as much as it had the previous two years, according to Civiqs, an online research firm. Just over half of American voters support the movement, and in dozens of towns that held protests, the population was almost exclusively white.
“This is the first time that I think a lot of us have felt that the battle is legitimately joined,” author Ta-Nehisi Coates said on “The Ezra Klein Show’’ last week. Significant swathes of people in non-Black communities, Coates said, have come to perceive something of the deep pain and suffering experienced by Black Americans. “I think that’s different.’’
One source of angst for white Americans who say they want to dismantle racism, though, is not knowing precisely where to start. They worry about sounding racist and not sounding sufficiently anti-racist. Some have made misguided offers of cash to Black acquaintances who feel condescended to. Others have formed anti-racist study groups with other white people — but worry that those, too, are lacking.
“I’ll be thinking, ‘Constantly acknowledging racism right now, it’s so draining,’ ” said Erin Lunsford, 29, of Richmond, Virginia, who has engaged in dozens of conversations regarding defunding the police, a popular policy proposal among anti-racism activists that she initially rejected. “And then I’m like, ‘Imagine being a Black person doing that your whole life.’ ”
In the month since Floyd’s death, a museum on the courthouse square in Sumner, Mississippi, dedicated to Emmett Till, whose horrific 1955 murder helped galvanize the civil rights movement, has received 10 times the usual number of calls. Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission — which founded the museum — said the callers were white Americans wanting to contribute to preservation projects or help develop curriculum. Dozens more downloaded a smartphone app that guides users on a virtual tour of civil rights history.
Since the first week of protests, Akbar Watson, owner of a Black bookstore in Boynton Beach, Florida, has been slammed with book sales and requests from customers as far away as California and Maine. One day, he said, he sold 40 books before lunch. Another day, a woman in Ohio purchased 34 Black children’s books for her daughter’s school classroom. And for the first time in his 28 years in business, he has sold out of his titles about racial inequalities.
“These are white Americans who are calling and ordering books to try to educate themselves and to try to figure out what to do as a response to what is happening,” said Watson, 60, owner of Pyramid Books, who spent Saturday hand-delivering books in Palm Beach County.
Matt Bartley, a tattoo artist in Pikeville, Kentucky, has fielded more than 20 requests to cover up racist tattoos since he began offering the service for free after Floyd’s death. One client had the words “Mein Kampf” tattooed on him, by his father, when he was a teenager, Bartley said. Similar services are being performed by tattoo artists in Dallas; Murray, Kentucky; Charlottesville, Virginia; and Maryville and Nashville, Tennessee.
Among Bartley’s clients was Kyle Kessler, a 29-year-old who had a Confederate flag tattoo covered last week.
Kessler said he never saw the Confederate flag as a racist symbol, until recently. He got the tattoo when he was 18, in tribute to one of his favorite bands.
But in conversations with his wife and sister about Floyd’s death, he began to wonder what impact the flag has on Black Americans. He also wondered what the repercussions could be for his 3-month-old son and whether he would be setting the wrong example.
“With everything going on, he’s going to be taught that’s racist, which I now know it is,” Kessler said. “I didn’t want him thinking, ‘Daddy’s got that, and it’s racist, so it’s OK to be racist.’ ”
Kessler said Floyd’s death, and the protests that followed, have made him think differently about the Black Lives Matter movement. Now, Kessler said he appreciates that people are standing up for themselves and their right to equality. His new tattoo — the same guitar but without the Confederate banner — reflects that changing perspective.
In Somerset, a small town in southwestern Pennsylvania, Cindy Kinsella, 61, said she knows far more police officers than Black people — her brother is a state police officer in Maryland, and she knows plenty of corrections officers.
She was not sure what to make of the protests when her son told her that he was helping to plan a demonstration. She wished him luck. Then she thought a little more about it.
“I got off the phone and thought, ‘You know what? I’m going to take my grandson, who is 12, and we’re going down,’ ” she recalled. “Just because I thought we could educate ourselves a bit.”
They went to the rally and though they did not march, they watched and listened to the speakers. It was peaceful, nothing like some of the violent protests she had seen in photographs and videos.
It is unclear what he got out of it. But she said she changed her thinking on some things. For example, the phrase Black Lives Matter.
“Before,” she said, “I thought, ‘Why do we have to say Black lives matter? Because all lives matter, police lives matter, white lives matter.’ But as they explained a little bit, ‘We’re not saying all lives don’t matter. It’s that all lives can’t matter until Black lives matter.’ ”

NEW YORK — The video rolls on a sunny suburban street, and a group of Black children bike toward what looks to them like a parade — there’s a small crowd, and an American flag. Suddenly, they’re swarmed by a group of white children, who hurl racial epithets and rocks. Adults gathered nearby do nothing.
The Black children had bicycled straight into a white supremacist rally.
The scene captured in 1975 by “Bill Moyers Journal,” a PBS documentary series, has echoes of the racist clashes more than a decade earlier in places like Selma, Alabama; Birmingham, Alabama; and Little Rock, Arkansas. But it unfolded in New York City, in the bedroom community of Rosedale in Queens, nearly a dozen years after the Civil Rights Act was made law.
Forty-five years later, that virulent two-minute, 20-second snippet of the documentary, “Rosedale: The Way It Is,” resurfaced online, shared last year by a graduate student, and boomeranged across the internet. Its quietly forgotten subject, a rash of firebombings of Black families’ homes in Queens, upended for a new generation the city’s narrative as a bastion of tolerance and exposed its core falsehood: that racism is a scourge of elsewhere.
And it shocked the children even then: “I never even knew people were like that,” one of the Black girls says after the attack in 1975 as the documentarian films, her pigtailed friend looking on. “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.”
In recent weeks, the city’s storyline of a utopian melting pot has been further punctured as New York heaves with unrest over the systemic racism Black people face, and the video has again gone viral.
As it ricocheted around the internet, racking up millions of views, provoking anguished discussion about the city’s past, one line of questioning coalesced:
Who were those children? How did it shape them? Where are they now?
“I’m still here,” Samantha Brown-Carter said. She was the girl in pigtails; now she is 55 years old. She sat for an interview in the home she grew up in, a neighborhood just north of where the episode unfolded nearly half a century ago.
“Was it traumatic? Will I always remember it? Yes,” Brown-Carter said. “But I never felt an urge to leave, never for any reason at all.”
She is one of five of the about a dozen Black children in the PBS documentary that The New York Times was able to locate as part of an exhaustive, monthslong search that encompassed property records, elementary school yearbooks and local memory.
But while over 90 people linked to Rosedale were contacted, just one person identified any of the numerous unnamed white children or adults in the film — a teenager who would later become her brother-in-law, the person said, and who has since died. The person asked that her name not be published, for fear of reprisals from her community.
The Rosedale of the 1970s was a predominantly white working-class neighborhood of about 25,000, home to civil service workers, police officers and firefighters of mainly Italian, Irish and Jewish descent. But like much of New York City at that time, demographics were shifting as Black and immigrant families moved in and, in response, some white families headed out.
In 1974, Ormistan and Glenda Spencer, Trinidadian immigrants from London, moved their family into a Cape Cod house at 243-11 136th Ave. — and unwittingly into a cresting battle of real estate and race. On New Year’s Eve the next year, while the family was asleep at home, a pipe bomb was thrown through the home’s window.
“In England, you hear about this happening in the South,” Ormistan Spencer told The Times shortly after the attack. “But you just don’t think it happens in New York City.”
Then it happened again: Arsonists set fire to another Black family’s home. Then again: A Molotov cocktail was chucked through the window of a home recently purchased by a Black person. And there were still more attacks.
But the Black children on that sunny afternoon in 1975, out for what they called a “bike hike,” had only a vague understanding of the social forces fomenting in Rosedale, the neighborhood beside their own of Cambria Heights.
They did not know that it had become a launch pad of “white flight,” the phenomenon of mass migration of white people from urban areas to the suburbs as nonwhite immigrants and Black people moved in.
Or that some white residents of Rosedale instead entrenched, and used violence to do so.
The young friends had other things on their mind that day — juicy burgers. They got on their bikes and pedaled toward the McDonald’s on the other side of Rosedale. Partway there, the children spotted a crowd. Above the gathering flew an American flag.
“The last thing that I remember was someone saying, ‘Oh, a parade!’ And so we went down to go see the parade,” said Mark Blagrove, who is now 57 and works in information technology sales and consulting. “And I laugh about it until this day, because it was a parade,” he said, “to get the Black people out of Rosedale.”
At the march and rally was ROAR: Return Our American Rights, a racist neighborhood group whose mission was to prevent Black people from buying area homes. As police officers stood guard in front of the Spencers’ home, white residents massed, chanting racist epithets. (Among their complaints was that the family had been given a police guard.)
“The American flag is the image when I think about that incident,” said Renée Lipscomb-McDonald, now 58 years old and a social worker. “That’s the symbol that pulled us into that situation, because of the idea that we live in America, the American flag means good things.”
She began to cry. “They took that beautiful image and turned it into something ugly for me,” she said.
She straightened. “I want the flag back.”
Moyers, who served as press secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, said he was drawn to Rosedale as a journalist because he was interested in the societal ramifications of the Johnson administration’s efforts to put an end to segregation. Moyers and his camera crew set out to understand its effect and stumbled upon its real-world consequence on a street corner: the attack on their peers by children steeped in hate.
What he discovered in Queens, he said, was racism enmeshed with economic anxiety — a belief that the newcomers would bring waves of crime and slash property values. Plus, there was a toxic fear held by white residents of losing their dominance, he said, something he sees echoed in the politics of today.
“We are in the last battle of white supremacy at the moment, and that was incipient in what was happening in Rosedale in the early 1970s,” Moyers said. “The past is very much alive today. Rosedale is being played out in a hundred different ways.”
Today Rosedale is 80% Black and 5% white, and still a cozy commuter community of civil service workers and tidy, mowed lawns. It has seen little of the types of protests and marches that have engulfed much of the city in recent weeks, demanding the end of systemic racism and police brutality against Black people.
But as the video has plastered Brown-Carter’s Facebook feed, questions being raised across the city plague her: “What I wonder about is those white children — they grew up,” she said. “Did they become police officers? Or did their children become police officers?”
The incident still fills Lipscomb-McDonald with rage, both for the little girl she was, and in light of this era’s similar struggles, how intractable racism seems. In recent days, she said, she has marched in Black Lives Matter protests near her home in Bel Air, Maryland, with her children. “Which is beautiful,” she said, “and very sad that another generation has to take up the cause.”
But that cruel moment of rocks, bikes and brutal words has also impelled her forward, even informing her choice to become a social worker. “My role is to provide hope,” she said of her profession.
“Maybe that’s the most significant lesson I got out of that day,” Lipscomb-McDonald added. “That no little girl will ride down the block and ever believe for a second that she’s not worthy of respect.”

When Greg Glassman resigned this month as chief executive of CrossFit Inc., excoriated for comments about George Floyd’s death on Twitter and in a Zoom meeting, people who have worked there were surprised that his downfall was tied to accusations of racism.
They had assumed that the reason would be routine and rampant sexual harassment.
Interviews with eight former employees, and four CrossFit athletes with strong ties to the company, reveal a management culture rife with covert and vulgar talk about women: their bodies, how much male employees, primarily Glassman, would like to have sex with them and how lucky the women should feel to have his rabid interest.
According to the dozen interviewed, Glassman, 63, has verbally demeaned women, pulled at their clothes to try to peek at their cleavage and aimed his phone’s camera to snap photos of their breasts while they traveled with him for work (sometimes pressuring them to consider sharing hotel rooms or borrowed houses with him).
Through a company spokesman and spokeswoman, Glassman denied such conduct. The spokeswoman said Glassman has treated her only respectfully. She suggested that people speaking out against Glassman are doing so to lessen the worth of his company and then buy it from him. “There is a collective effort to devalue the company and buy it for scraps,” she said.
The former employees say reporting the harassment was not an option. Glassman is the sole owner of CrossFit Inc. Perhaps the most powerful female executive there, Kathy Glassman, the affiliate director, is Glassman’s sister, and they were reluctant to complain to her. There was no human resources manager until 2013. That manager left the company in January and has not been replaced.
A Devoted Community
Now headquartered in Scotts Valley, California, CrossFit was created in 2000. It is privately held and employs 72 people full-time, down from 137 two years ago. A shift in the company’s focus from competitive games to health initiatives, and the pandemic, have resulted in layoffs. Most departing workers receive severance only if they signed nondisclosure agreements.
Dave Castro, a longtime deputy of Glassman’s who has taken over as the company’s chief executive, declined to speak for this article.
The spokespeople noted that the CrossFit Games, a professional competition introduced by the company in 2007, rewards men and women with equal prize money and that the method encourages women to celebrate strength and fitness regardless of body type or weight.
Even those critical of CrossFit’s culture praised its rigorous exercise method, which is taught in thousands of mom-and-pop gyms around the country that have licensed the CrossFit trademark. For some of its devotees, CrossFit is a near-religion.
“There is so much positive in the CrossFit community,” said one female former employee who, like many others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity because she fears legal retribution from Glassman. “Do you want to be the person who ruins people’s hopes and dreams and even their businesses? CrossFit is not just about fitness. It becomes your friends, your family, your community. People create their entire lives around it.”
Away from the local gyms where he is venerated, though, the picture of Glassman clouds quickly. “There was a constant narrative about women,” the former corporate employee said. She described his using vulgarities frequently to refer to women, enumerating which he wanted to have sex with and which he wouldn’t. He “was always descriptive in nature about it,” she said, “bragging about sexual escapades.”
This attitude was so entwined with operations that the Wi-Fi password at a company office in San Diego used to be a sexist obscenity, according to three former employees.
Male employees would rank female professional CrossFit athletes according to how much the men wanted to have sex with them, according to an email from a current CrossFit employee to a former one that was reviewed by The New York Times. (Glassman denies this, his spokeswoman said.)
In 2012, Glassman agreed to pay a financial settlement to Julie Kelly, a former employee whose lawyers threatened to file a sexual harassment lawsuit, according to three people in the CrossFit community with direct knowledge of the situation. Among other incidents, they related, during a company get-together at a bar, Glassman stood next to Kelly and made a vulgar and obscene comment about her to another man, (Glassman denies this, the spokeswoman said, and would not comment on the settlement.)
Also that year, Glassman was being driven to the airport by Andy Stumpf, a former Navy SEAL with five Bronze Star medals and a Purple Heart who oversaw CrossFit Inc.s partnership with Reebok and also worked as Glassman’s pilot.
“We were in the car and he was chuckling,” said Stumpf, in an interview. “I asked why he was in such a good mood and he said, ‘I finally finished up with the bullshit with Julie; I had to pay that whore.’”
Kelly declined an interview request.
‘A Very Elegant Solution’
In an interview, Lauren Jenai, Glassman’s ex-wife who founded CrossFit with him, said that the employees and athletes were accurately describing the corporate atmosphere she witnessed before divorcing Glassman in 2013. She also confirmed that Glassman entered into a financial settlement with Kelly to avoid a sexual harassment lawsuit. (Jenai received $20 million from Glassman as part of their divorce settlement, in exchange for her ownership of the company.)
“He’s the father of my kids. I care about Greg and about CrossFit,” Jenai said, “but this should be addressed.”
Of the constant sexualized assessment of women, she said, “100%. That happens every day, all day.”
Jenai said the vulgar Wi-Fi password was also used in the home she shared with Glassman and was in keeping with the office patois. “They are nasty about women and they talk freely in front of them, and it does make my skin crawl,” she said, but not always. “I think it does need to be said that both Greg and I, and our friends, have raw senses of humor. There is a lot of that banter that I don’t find offensive but the difference was, I was in a position of leadership so my job didn’t depend on how I responded to those remarks.”
Jenai said people were punished for challenging the culture. “If you didn’t agree with Greg, you would be ostracized, especially if you were a female,” she said. “For me, the bigger problem than the language is the culture behind it. If you speak out, you’re out. I’ve seen it firsthand, over and over and over.”
The CrossFit spokeswoman said that Jenai was motivated to lessen the company’s value so she could buy it. The spokesman forwarded an email sent by Jenai to Matt Holdsworth, CrossFit Inc.’s chief financial officer, on June 15, less than a week after Glassman had resigned.
“My interest and intentions are solely based on wanting to help with current issues CrossFit is facing. I do not want to see the company or brand suffer,” Jenai wrote. “I’m looking at $50M as an offer — or thereabouts. Is this something CrossFit Inc would consider?”
On Saturday morning, Jenai confirmed this. “I was approached by an investment company who wants to back me in buying CrossFit,” she said. “In people’s minds, including mine, it would be a very elegant solution. I don’t want to see this thing go down the drain. I’ve talked to reporters because if I say nothing I’m complicit. If I talk to people and don’t tell the truth, I’m a liar.”
‘A Metric Ton of Inappropriate Behavior’
CrossFit’s first workouts were held in a garage in Santa Cruz, California. The county sheriff’s department was among Glassman’s earliest clients. The method has been popular among the police and the military, including those assigned to elite teams like the Green Berets and the Navy SEALS, enhancing the fitness program’s credibility.
At the beginning of 2020, there were more than 14,000 affiliate gyms, according to Justin LoFranco, founder of Morning Chalk Up, a newsletter that covers the CrossFit community. Affiliated gyms pay CrossFit Inc. an annual fee of $3,000 or less.
The company also draws revenue from CrossFit Games and sponsorships, like one from Reebok, which was valued at about $100 million over the last 10 years.
By the time the deal with Reebok was struck in 2010, CrossFit Inc. already had a reputation.
Lindsey Johnson, a CrossFit athlete hired by Reebok to train its executives, turned down an opportunity to do additional work for CrossFit Inc.
“I had heard too many stories about too many things I didn’t want to be a part of,” Johnson said, including “straight-up bullying and sexual harassment of women. We’ve heard this story before. This isn’t a brand-new situation, someone at the top with a God complex.”
After Glassman’s inflammatory tweet and comments about Floyd, Reebok announced that it would not renew the CrossFit deal. Morning Chalk Up reported that more than 1,200 affiliates had plans to dissociate themselves from the CrossFit brand. (“Greg thought Reebok was a terrible partner. He has been dying to get out of” the contract, the spokeswoman said. The spokesman added that only 450 affiliates have officially deactivated, some because of the pandemic.)
Last week, scrutiny of the company intensified after Stumpf, a speaker on leadership, devoted an entire episode of his podcast, “Cleared Hot,” to what he saw while working for CrossFit Inc. from 2010 to 2014.
“I cannot count the number of times that derogatory and specifically sexual comments were made about female staff members directly in my presence,” Stumpf said, urging Glassman and the company to release former employees from nondisclosure agreements.
The CrossFit spokeswoman said that Glassman believes that Stumpf is working with his ex-wife to try to buy the company. (“I want nothing to do with CrossFit for the rest of my life,” Stumpf said, “and no amount of money and no position offered to me would change my position.”)
The former employees interviewed by The Times said much of the mistreatment happened openly, which made them question their own reactions and wonder if they were being too sensitive. Some worried that speaking out would cost them their jobs.
“There was a metric ton of inappropriate behavior but even worse, there was a systematic problem of undermining women,” one former employee said. “The systematic way they chip away at your self-confidence, I had never experienced anything like that.”
CrossFit Inc. also sometimes flaunted a raunchy attitude toward women in its own promotion.
In a podcast interview for the CrossFit Journal conducted in January 2018, Sevan Matossian, a longtime deputy of Glassman’s, interviewed Stacie Tovar, an affiliate owner in Omaha, Nebraska, and a popular, retired professional CrossFit athlete.
Matossian asked her if she was sexually active with her husband and if she took birth control pills. He told her he preferred a bathing suit photo of her on her website to one showing her in athletic competition. “Your body is freakishly amazing,” he said. Lamenting changes brought about by the MeToo movement, he said, “You can’t even ask your significant other for” oral sex anymore.
“A fitness industry is different from an accounting firm,” the CrossFit spokeswoman said, regarding the podcast.
That summer, the company hosted a CrossFit Health Conference in Madison, Wisconsin. A blown-up poster on social media and near the entrance of the conference featured an illustration of a doctor with money coming out of his white doctor’s coat, surrounded by scantily dressed, buxom women, including one with dollar bills coming out of her short-shorts as she grasps the doctor’s crotch.
Jenai, who now runs Manifest, which provides testing kits and personal coaching to help people deal with chronic health issues, said that Glassman’s putting Castro in charge will not solve CrossFit Inc.’s problems, since Glassman retains ownership.
“He is a yes man,” she said of Castro. “I believe Dave being put in this position, there is no change. It is the status quo.”
The CrossFit spokesman said it was untrue that Glassman would still be calling the shots. “He wants to retire and home-school his kids,” he said.

TULSA, Okla. — Public health experts issued dire warnings. Local officials expressed unease. The coronavirus cases continued to climb.
And still, they came.
President Donald Trump’s most faithful supporters piled into tents or lounged in lawn chairs, some wearing masks and others dismissing the need for them, as they waited hours and, in some cases, days to join in his return to the campaign trail. By early Saturday morning, the line of voters camped out for Trump’s evening rally extended multiple blocks, with attendees eager to fill the 19,000-seat BOK Center, defying public health recommendations.
Despite the adoring fans willing to risk illness to see him in this deep red state, Trump arrives in Tulsa at a moment of political peril. His poll numbers nationally and in critical battleground states have plummeted, he faces disapproval of his stewardship of the coronavirus and outrage over his posture toward peaceful protesters of police brutality, and he has struggled to press a clear case against Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent.
The rally itself had produced a chaotic several days in Tulsa, coming on the weekend of the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. Trump’s discordant stance toward the holiday — he originally was unaware of it, then later took credit for making it “very famous” — and his divisive rhetoric about Americans protesting against racial injustice had added to the fraught nature of the weekend in a city with a painful history for black residents.
His supporters waited for the rally around 1 mile from Greenwood Avenue, which in 1921 was the site of one of America’s worst racist massacres. Black Tulsans had gathered there on Friday to commemorate Juneteenth and many had denounced police brutality. A number of Trump backers, while expressing support for peaceful protesters, also argued that if the nation countenanced demonstrators congregating in large crowds, then they should be free to participate in the president’s rally without criticism — though public health experts have said that large indoor gatherings are more dangerous than outdoor events.
“You have people who, for political reasons, will be great with a transgender rally in New York or a protest, but if you go to church or a Trump rally, well, you’ve got to be concerned about COVID,” said former Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, who planned to attend as a Trump surrogate. He called the virus “real” and urged precautions, but added, “This rally is no less risky than the protests that were taking place over the last three weeks.”
The scene here on the sidewalks near the arena offered a vivid illustration of the president’s power over the Republican base even when he is at his most vulnerable.
Trump rallygoers on Friday and early Saturday lined up wearing Trump hats and carrying flags — Trump flags, American flags, flags bearing images of Trump kissing an American flag. A “four more years” chant broke out before 7 a.m. For blocks, the scene was more reminiscent of a sports tailgate than a political rally, as music and beer flowed between supporters, some of whom had traveled hundreds of miles.
In interviews, some of them described the coronavirus crisis that has killed nearly 120,000 Americans as overblown. The death toll, they argued, was exaggerated or manipulated — a view experts say is inaccurate. For many supporters who crowded the sidewalks here, the coronavirus seemed like just one more risk to mitigate, as with anything else in life — but no reason to skip seeing the president, who carried Oklahoma by about 36 percentage points in 2016.
“This is a chance of a lifetime,” said Sue Williams, 72, of Tulsa. Williams, who was not wearing a mask, is in an age demographic that is especially vulnerable to the coronavirus crisis. But she said she had no concerns. “I’ve been praying. I’m in good health. When they have the rally, I’ll wear a mask.”
In interviews, attendees said they viewed the president as a strong leader on the economy, despite millions being out of work during the pandemic. They still appreciated his disdain for political correctness. Some saw Trump as a champion of traditional Christian values they believed were under assault, though he is not known to personally be religious.
Trump drew widespread criticism when his administration ordered aggressive police action to clear peaceful protesters in order to be photographed holding a Bible, but to some, the image appeared to break through in a positive way. “I’ve seen him on TV praying, I’ve seen him on TV with a Bible in his hand,” Williams said.
Others suggested that Washington and the news media had never given him a fair shake, nearly four years into his presidency.
“He’s done great things,” said Jill Strother, 56, from Edmond, Oklahoma, who waited for Trump with her teenage son, who brought a mask. “He just hasn’t had a chance. He’s had to spend most of his time defending himself from, I guess, fake news.”
Amid a dueling desire to reopen the economy while maintaining safety, there are sharp partisan differences over how concerned voters are about the virus spreading: 70% of Democrats said they were very concerned in a recent Fox News poll, while only 35% of Republicans said the same, though people who wear face masks were viewed favorably by 68% of Republicans and 89% of Democrats.
In an interview on Thursday, state Rep. James White, R-Texas, expressed confidence that social distancing would be achievable at the rally because, he said, any event put on by the president would certainly adhere to safety protocols issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a federal agency.
“I don’t see why the president would violate his own guidelines,” said White, a Trump surrogate who plans to attend the rally. “If I get there and people are on top of each other, that would look kind of interesting because I believe the CDC works for the president.”
Few of those lined up to see Trump seemed concerned about maintaining significant distances from one another. People crowded in close for a prayer circle Friday afternoon at the Trump encampment, where mask-wearing was light.
On Friday evening, as cigarette smoke wafted, attendees dined together — a group went to Buffalo Wild Wings, others had pizza or Whataburger as they spoke with their neighbors. At least one said he had spent the night sleeping in a lawn chair, sharing a tent with others he had met only the previous day.
“I don’t have a problem shaking hands with perfect strangers,” said that man, who would identify himself only as Jason, 48, an electrician from Seattle. He declined to give a last name, citing a fear of being doxxed. “This coronavirus is a little bit hyped up. The media hypes things.”
The coronavirus outbreak combined with a national debate over systemic racism brought two of America’s crises into focus in Oklahoma this weekend.
White, who is African American, said that on his trip he also intended to visit Greenwood Avenue.
“We support the president, my district supports the president, at least based on the last voting tally I looked at in 2016,” White said, explaining his reasons for going to Tulsa. But, he added, “This is not just going up for the president — it’s having some opportunity to visit Greenwood and reflect on that horrible massacre.”
Nevertheless, the president was hardly promoting a moment of national reflection as Juneteenth approached. On Thursday night, he tweeted two fake videos, one about a racist baby that both Twitter and Facebook removed. And on Friday, he tweeted a barely veiled threat at protesters, suggesting there would be no lenience if they caused trouble at his event.
In the Greenwood Avenue neighborhood, that message was instead taken as an unmistakable threat. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a frequent critic of the president who was the keynote speaker at Friday’s Juneteenth event, said of the tweet: “We won’t bend, we won’t bow, we won’t give up. We have fought harder battles than this.”
The contentious nature of Saturday’s rally, and the split screen of Trump’s Tulsa and the one that embraced Sharpton, stands in contrast to the spirit of racial reconciliation that Tulsa has long sought to foster. Because of the city’s history, and the approaching centennial anniversary of the 1921 race massacre, Republicans and Democrats have sought to form a shared political vocabulary, particularly when it comes to race. Sen. James Lankford, a Republican and staunch ally of Trump, attended the Juneteenth celebrations with his family.
Phil Armstrong, one of the leaders of a commission established to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the massacre, which Lankford has supported, bemoaned the effect that outsiders — including Trump’s fans from across the country — could have on Tulsa’s carefully balanced relationships, both across race and political party.
“When white mobs destroyed Greenwood, there was a mindset that people said, We’re going to rebuild and make this bigger and better,” Armstrong said. “We have that same mindset now. Trump is coming? And on Juneteenth weekend? No. We’re going to come together and we’re going to be a countermessage.”
However, he said he was still nervous as Saturday approached, saying he worried about outside groups stoking violence.
In Oklahoma, guns may be carried without a license by most state residents.
But on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, at the Trump encampment, the mood was more joyous than tense.
David Edmondson of Dallas, who said he works at the face shield company TrueHero, coaxed attendees to put on shields he was distributing, in part, by assuring them the goods were not made in China.
“I want people to take them,” said Edmondson, a Trump supporter, citing the risks of the virus. “It’s not political,” he said. “You’ve got some people thinking it’s made up.”
Edmondson did not plan to attend the rally.

Iowa was not on anyone’s bingo card of 2020 battlegrounds.
Donald Trump carried the state by nine percentage points in 2016, and a year ago prominent Democrats in the state passed up the chance to challenge Sen. Joni Ernst, a popular Republican seeking reelection.
But with the political ground shifting precariously under Trump amid multiple crises, Iowa is unexpectedly in play in the presidential and Senate races this year, moving Republicans to high alert. Democrats, who a few years ago were shrouded in despair that their party might never again appeal to white working-class voters, are energized.
A poll published by The Des Moines Register and Mediacom on Monday showed Trump with only a one-point lead in the state over former Vice President Joe Biden. The poll revealed a deep erosion of support for the president among white women without college degrees, voters who were key to his 2016 coalition across a swath of Midwestern swing states.
The same survey showed that Ernst, a rising star in her party in her first term, was narrowly trailing her little-known Democratic challenger.
Theresa Greenfield, the Democratic Senate nominee who emerged from a primary on June 2, is running primarily on a biography with parallels to the one Ernst used to introduce herself to Iowans six years ago: Both grew up on farms, and both have made promises to show Washington their scrappy values of hard work and self-reliance.
But Greenfield is turning Ernst’s celebrated anti-establishment catchphrase against her rival.
“Sen. Ernst told Iowans in 2014 she was going to be independent and different and she was going to ‘make ’em squeal,’ ” Greenfield said in an interview, echoing a television ad six years ago in which Ernst said she would take a knife to federal spending the way she castrated hogs on the farm. “The bottom line is nobody’s squealing except Iowans.”
Ernst declined an interview request. But her advisers noted that Greenfield, a businesswoman and political newcomer, was riding the crest of more than $7 million in positive TV ads by liberal outside groups.
“This is Greenfield’s high-water mark,” said David Kochel, a senior adviser to the Ernst campaign. He promised that the Democrat would soon face a barrage of negativity. “Forty percent of Iowans don’t have an opinion of Theresa Greenfield,” he said. “We’re here to help.”
In the Des Moines Register poll, Trump led Biden 44% to 43% among likely voters, the latest in a wave of national and state polls showing the president’s prospects for reelection at their most precarious all year.
Although the road to the White House in November will not hinge on Iowa, with its meager six electoral votes, the tightness of the race in the state is an ominous sign for Trump in other Midwestern battlegrounds like Ohio and Wisconsin, which also have large electorates of older and rural voters, and white voters without college degrees.
Amid a pandemic that the president seeks to minimize, and widespread anti-police protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Trump’s approval has slipped five points in Iowa since March, to 45%. Only 37% approve of the way he has handled the protests. The president retains strong support from evangelical voters and white men. But white working-class women preferred Biden over Trump in the Register poll, 53% to 35%.
The 18-point gap strikingly reversed the president’s advantage from 2016, when he carried white women without college diplomas by two points in Iowa. He won the state after it twice voted for President Barack Obama.
“Right now I’d like to kick them all out,” said Mary Figenshaw, a political independent in Jefferson, Iowa. A retired bank teller, she is “not crazy about” a second term for Ernst, she said. “I don’t think she’s done a lot. She’s standing by Mitch McConnell in all the photos. I just don’t think any of our congressmen are doing what they should be doing for the common people.”
Rob Sand, Iowa’s state auditor and one of its top elected Democrats, said that Iowans swung to Trump because he promised to stand up for people who felt marginalized in the economy and ignored by political elites. But the twin crises of the coronavirus and racial injustice have exposed the president as incapable of empathy or leadership, Sand said, adding, “He can’t handle a crisis.”
Recognizing the threat in Iowa, the president’s reelection campaign spent more than $400,000 on TV ads in the state in May and June, according to Advertising Analytics, a tracking firm.
Democrats’ top presidential super PAC, Priorities USA, rated Iowa this month as leaning toward Trump and outside the top-six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida. But that might change. “While Iowa isn’t currently in our spending plans, it’s a state we’re keeping an eye on,” said Josh Schwerin, a senior strategist for the group. “The fact that it’s in play shows that Biden is on offense and will have multiple paths to 270,” he added, referring to the electoral votes needed for victory.
It’s a different story in the Senate race. Democratic outside groups have booked $24.1 million to support Greenfield with TV ads through Election Day, and Republican groups are close behind with $22.6 million on behalf of Ernst.
Democrats hoping to control the Senate need to net four seats in November (or three if they win the White House since the vice president has a tiebreaking vote). Their top targets are Republican incumbents in Colorado, Arizona and Maine. Close behind are the incumbents in North Carolina and, increasingly, Iowa.
The Senate Majority PAC, the top outside Democratic group in Senate races, has lined up $13 million for TV ads in Iowa after Labor Day. It matches $12.5 million reserved by the leading Republican outside group, the Senate Leadership Fund.
“The idea that Iowa’s in play really shouldn’t surprise people,” said J.B. Poersch, president of the Senate Majority PAC, which is aligned with Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “It came to the table this way, since the intensity of the caucuses.”
The Iowa caucuses in February may have been a fiasco when it came to counting votes, as well as an embarrassment for Biden, who finished fourth. But a year of intense organizing by presidential hopefuls in the state brought a bounty of new Democratic voters. Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans in the state by 9,000, a reversal from the 2018 midterm elections when Republicans had a 23,000-voter advantage.
Greenfield, who until recently was president of a commercial real estate company, led Ernst by three points in the Register poll, 46% to 43%. It is the first time Ernst, a former state senator and National Guard commander in Iraq, has trailed in a general election survey by the pollster J. Ann Selzer, the most respected in Iowa, since 2014. (Greenfield’s lead, however, was within the poll’s margin of sampling error.)
Paralleling the gender gap in the presidential race, Greenfield held a 20-point lead among women. Just as Ernst, 49, told of her thrifty farm upbringing when she first ran, Greenfield, 56, describes how her parents, who ran a crop-dusting business and raised hogs just across the Minnesota border, were driven out of farming in the 1980s farm crisis.
“They never farmed again and us five kids left the rural area,” she said.
Greenfield’s first husband, a union electrician, died in a workplace accident; as a candidate she praises the Social Security survivors’ benefits that sustained her, a narrative with obvious appeal in Iowa’s blue-collar communities along the Mississippi River, the swingiest part of the state.
“It was Social Security, it was union benefits that kept me from going into poverty and gave me the opportunity to pay the rent and put milk in the fridge and go back to school and start rebuilding a path to providing for my family,” Greenfield said.
At the same time, she accused Ernst of implying she would cut Social Security “behind closed doors” — an attack that seemed to twist a comment of Ernst’s last year.
As promised, the Ernst campaign has gone on the attack since Greenfield emerged from her four-way primary. “Liberal outside groups spent $10 million to prop up Chuck Schumer’s candidate, Theresa Greenfield, in the primary,” said Brendan Conley, a spokesperson for Ernst. “But now Iowans are learning about Greenfield’s record as a failed real estate executive, like kicking out small businesses to make way for a multinational corporation.”
The reference is to a strip-mall redevelopment that Greenfield oversaw in 2015. Small retailers were displaced. Greenfield said the merchants had reached the end of their leases, and today a new shopping center on the site is home to other retailers. The “multinational corporation” was an Aldi grocery store that never moved in. “Sen. Ernst, she’s desperate,” Greenfield said.
Despite being a political novice, Greenfield has absorbed message discipline. She skirted attacking Trump in the interview. Asked if her race would be swept up in a broad referendum on the president, she replied: “Gosh, I have no idea. I’ll let Iowans decide what they think about President Trump. I’m running against Sen. Ernst and that’s what I stay focused on.”

Decenas de consejeros y aliados de la Casa Blanca que interactúan con el mandatario dijeron que su comportamiento autodestructivo daña sus perspectivas de reelegirse y que no parece muy capaz —ni dispuesto— de enmendarse.
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times.
Hace poco, en una reunión con sus principales asesores políticos, el presidente Donald Trump se impacientó cuando le advirtieron que iba camino a la derrota en noviembre si continuaba con su comportamiento incendiario en público y en Twitter.
Días antes, Trump había encendido alarmas cuando respondió a las protestas por la brutalidad policial con la amenaza de que “cuando empiezan los saqueos, empiezan los tiroteos”.
Trump reviró contra sus asesores. “Tengo que ser yo”, respondió, según tres personas familiarizadas con la reunión. Unas horas más tarde, publicó en Twitter una carta de su exabogado personal en la cual describía a algunos de los manifestantes como “terroristas”.
En esos momentos, y en varias ocasiones desde entonces, la habitual resistencia del presidente ha estado impregnada de una mayor sensación de agitación debido a que enfrenta una serie de crisis externas que no ha podido contener, o que ha exacerbado, según las personas cercanas a él. Dicen que sus repetidos actos de autosabotaje político (como la tan criticada sesión de fotos en una iglesia para la cual se retiró por la fuerza a manifestantes pacíficos o la amenaza de utilizar al ejército estadounidense para reprimir las protestas) han dañado de manera considerable sus posibilidades de reelección. A pesar de ello, el presidente estadounidense parece casi totalmente incapaz o renuente a limitarlos.
Trump no quiere que se le vea como un “perdedor” —una etiqueta que detesta—, en la campaña contra el exvicepresidente Joe Biden. Algunos asesores creen que el gusto de Trump por la pelea regresará en otoño, cuando la lucha por las elecciones generales esté más avanzada.
Pero por ahora, dijeron, el presidente actúa como si estuviera arrinconado y a la defensiva, y su comportamiento autodestructivo ha estado tan fuera de lugar para un presidente en funciones en un año electoral que muchos asesores se preguntan si de verdad le interesa mantenerse en el cargo un segundo periodo.
En lugar de centrarse en planes y objetivos para otros cuatro años de mandato, Trump se ha regodeado en la autocompasión por la cobertura noticiosa que se le ha hecho desde el comienzo de la pandemia del coronavirus, según dijeron personas que han hablado con él. Ha dicho a sus asesores que no importa lo que haga, no puede obtener “buenas” notas de la prensa, lo que con frecuencia ha sido su mayor interés. Trump se ha referido a los reporteros como “esa gente” ante sus asesores, intercalando una grosería entre las dos palabras.
El presidente se ha quejado de que nada de lo que hace les parece suficientemente bueno y le han enfurecido las críticas de que no ha manejado como se debe la muerte de George Floyd, un afroestadounidense asesinado por la policía en Mineápolis. Los comentarios que hizo sobre Floyd cuando asistió al lanzamiento del transbordador SpaceX deberían haber bastado, dijo a sus asesores.
De nueva cuenta, Trump se ha obsesionado con las filtraciones de la Casa Blanca y ha exigido que los funcionarios encuentren y enjuicien a los responsables de que se haya dado a conocer la información sobre su estancia en el búnker subterráneo de la Casa Blanca durante las protestas violentas. Y, aunque ha mostrado entusiasmo por reanudar sus ya característicos mítines, parece que la posibilidad de gobernar cuatro años más no le despierta el mismo sentir, según dijeron personas cercanas a él. Ya ha escogido los villanos a los que culpará si pierde: el mal manejo del coronavirus por parte de China, el cierre de la economía y los demócratas que, según ha dicho a sus asesores, le “robarán” la elección.
Sus asesores reconocieron que el presidente siempre ha tenido dificultades para controlar su comportamiento, que excede por mucho los límites de la conducta presidencial tradicional. Su tendencia a usar lenguaje racista, como el tuit sobre disparar a los saqueadores, es algo que desde hace mucho ha definido y debilitado su presidencia. Sin embargo, su comportamiento y sus comentarios recientes, así como su incapacidad para superarlos, sorprenden a sus asesores por la diferencia con sus anomalías habituales.
The New York Times entrevistó a más de una decena de personas que interactúan con el presidente de manera habitual, incluyendo a asesores actuales y anteriores de la Casa Blanca, asesores de campaña, amigos y asociados. La mayoría puso como condición conservar el anonimato para evitar represalias por hablar con honestidad sobre asuntos internos de la Casa Blanca. Les gustaría que ganara de nuevo, pero se dicen sorprendidos ante cómo ha cambiado su comportamiento durante esta última y terrible amenaza a su presidencia.
Peter King, representante republicano de Nueva York, dijo que los serios desafíos que enfrenta el país habían llevado a Trump a un territorio inexplorado. “Esto no es algo a lo que esté acostumbrado”, advirtió King en una entrevista.
“Hasta cierto punto, lo de Mueller fue fácil”, añadió King, al referirse al efectivo contragolpe de Trump en la investigación de Rusia llevada a cabo por el fiscal especial Robert Mueller. “Fue una variación de aquello con lo que ha tenido que lidiar durante toda su carrera. Siempre está luchando, y siempre hay al menos un 40 o 50 por ciento de personas que en un inicio están de tu lado”.
No obstante, en este momento, aseveró King, “es diferente”.
En una declaración, una vocera de la Casa Blanca, Alyssa Farah, dijo: “El presidente está totalmente comprometido con desempeñarse en el cargo un segundo mandato para ampliar los logros de su primer mandato y aportar más para el pueblo estadounidense”.
Un funcionario, que solo quiso hablar sobre los planes del gobierno, afirmó que a los miembros del personal encargados de las políticas se les pidió recién esta semana que presenten iniciativas para 2021 y los siguientes años.
Con la investigación de Rusia y el juicio político, según funcionarios de la Casa Blanca y de otros sectores, Trump estaba ansioso por luchar, y lo hizo con bastante eficacia. Ahora consideran que el comportamiento del presidente es autodestructivo y que sus arranques de ira y autoalabanza son inútiles contra un enemigo invisible como el virus y un movimiento de protesta con el que ha mostrado poca solidaridad.
“Es como un Lyndon B. Johnson moderno, al que todo le ha salido mal y ninguna de sus habilidades le sirve para superar esos tropiezos”, dijo Anthony Scaramucci, quien fungió como director de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca durante uno de los períodos más breves que se hayan registrado: 11 días. Aunque desde entonces ha denunciado públicamente al presidente, Scaramucci conoce a Trump de forma personal desde hace años y sigue siendo amigo de algunos funcionarios de la Casa Blanca.
Nada de lo que Trump ha intentado hasta ahora, dijo Scaramucci, ha cambiado el discurso sobre su presidencia ni ha despejado las preocupaciones más extensas sobre el racismo y la propagación del virus en la cobertura noticiosa.
“Por eso sé que no le gusta el trabajo”, dijo Scaramucci.
A menos de cinco meses del día de las elecciones, Trump parece, en general, incapaz de modificar su comportamiento y renuente a hacerlo, como sí lo hizo en ciertos momentos clave durante 2016: aceptó la elección de Mike Pence, un conservador recatado y religioso con el que no tenía relación previa, como su compañero de fórmula y silenció su Twitter en la víspera de las elecciones.
El fin de semana pasado, Trump por fin hizo lo que sus aliados consideraron una maniobra política sabia cuando anunció, de manera abrupta, que cambiaría la fecha de un mitin que sus asesores habían planeado en Tulsa, Oklahoma, el 19 de junio, un día festivo en el que se conmemora el fin de la esclavitud en Estados Unidos. Además, lo hizo muy a tono con su estilo, ya que Trump no informó a sus asesores sobre el cambio antes de tuitearlo.
Tom Cole, representante republicano de Oklahoma, aseveró que la campaña de Trump iba mejor que la de un presidente republicano anterior que perdió la reelección, el presidente George H.W. Bush.
“Vi mucho más letargo en la campaña de Bush de 1992 que en esta”, afirmó Cole.
Aun así, el presidente ha hecho declaraciones públicas en las que sugieren que su mente está en la vida fuera de la Casa Blanca.
En un evento reciente en el Jardín de las Rosas en el que Trump habló sobre la mejora en las contrataciones, mencionó el auge en la fabricación de vehículos recreativos, pero luego hizo una pausa antes de decir con un tono melancólico: “Puede que tenga que comprar una de esas cosas y conducir por la ciudad. Tal vez regrese a Nueva York con la primera dama en un remolque”.
Fue solo en abril que Trump realmente entendió la gravedad de las crisis gemelas —de salud y económica— causadas por el coronavirus, dijeron varios de sus asesores actuales y anteriores. Y agregaron que ya no confiaban en que él estuviera entusiasmado ante la idea de presidir la difícil tarea de sacar al país de una recesión, con pocos momentos de gloria.
Para Trump, el subidón de ganar la presidencia rara vez ha sido igualado por los deberes que conlleva el cargo, dijeron asesores actuales y anteriores.
La mayoría de los presidentes no tienen idea de cómo es el trabajo hasta que están en él. Pero para Trump, quien nunca había trabajado en el gobierno y pasó años como animador de televisión, las brechas en su conocimiento son enormes.
“En privado, Trump estaba interesado en ganar la presidencia”, dijo Sam Nunberg, quien trabajó en la campaña de Trump en 2015 y fue su asesor antes de eso. “Durante un periodo de tres años, entre 2012 y 2014, estuvo enfocado en los detalles e incluso en las minucias del proceso de las primarias y las elecciones generales. Siempre estuvo claro que Trump quería ser elegido presidente. Pero la realidad de ser presidente nunca se discutió”.
En 2016, Trump ofreció reiteradamente en sus discursos propuestas de políticas. Aún tiene que exponer lo que haría con un segundo mandato.
Al interior de la Casa Blanca, algunos miembros del personal describieron al presidente como alguien solitario, con pocas personas con las que disfruta hablar, y varios miembros del personal dijeron que el ánimo estaba en su punto más bajo desde las primeras semanas de su gobierno.
El ala oeste en la que Trump ha estado en un confinamiento virtual desde marzo carece de un sentido de urgencia o propósito, dicen visitantes recientes. Mark Meadows, el cuarto jefe de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, se ha quejado de que no tenía idea de cuán frágil y difícil era el clima hasta que llegó allí, según varias personas familiarizadas con sus conversaciones.
A Trump parece agradarle su nueva guerrera, la secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Kayleigh McEnany, pero los funcionarios dicen que ella pasa la mayor parte de su tiempo con el presidente y poco tiempo con el personal. Los días en los que ofrece sesiones informativas a los reporteros, pasa horas preparándose, lo que frustra a algunos de sus colegas. También ha sacado a varias personas de sus trabajos en el área de prensa y comunicaciones, y contrató a Chad Gilmartin, primo de su marido, para la función.
Los republicanos en Washington han concluido que Trump no puede ganar la reelección mientras siga detrás del escritorio, y esperan que reiniciar los mítines con el presidente —a partir del sábado en Tulsa— ofrecerá una distracción.
King dijo que la última vez que habló con Trump, justo antes del asesinato de Floyd, el presidente sonaba animado con sus perspectivas de reelección. “Estábamos hablando sobre algo más, y él dijo: ‘¿Qué tal va allá afuera, cómo me va?’”, recordó King. “Estaba muy optimista. El tono de su voz era el de quien esperaba que le dijera que lo estaba haciendo bien”.
Trump parece estar al tanto de que su suerte en la política ha cambiado, aunque no ha asumido su responsabilidad por el cambio. La semana pasada, en una entrevista con Fox News, para extrañeza de todos reconoció una realidad que no ha elegido ignorar.
“Si no gano, no gano. Ya sabes, me refiero a seguir adelante y hacer otras cosas”, dijo Trump.
Y añadió: “Creo que sería algo muy triste para nuestro país”.

Full text: The New York Times has fourteen photographers around the country capturing celebrations and protests today. This article will be updated throughout the day with more pictures.
Both the sun and a flag rose early Friday morning over the state capitol in Madison, Wis. One heralded a new day in 2020, the other symbolized freedom.
It is Juneteenth, the annual commemoration of the day in 1865 when a group of enslaved people in Texas received the long overdue news of their liberation, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation.
This year, the holiday -- cherished always by African-Americans -- feels bigger, more urgent as a nation gutted by a series of violent deaths of black people has given way to outsized demonstrations and protests against police brutality and the enduring clutch of racism.
Juneteenth reminds us that freedom, as a lived experience, is still not shared equally. But it is also an observance of resilience in a centuries-old journey. It is black joy and black hope and the protection of black hearts and black celebration in the very streets where demonstrators have shouted the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks.
So on Friday, the Juneteenth flag -- a star bursting forth across a rippling banner of red, white and blue -- rose with the morning light over the Wisconsin Capitol for the first time.
In Tulsa, Okla., two women stood close together on a street painted with Black Lives Matter, America's most urgent plea.
In Atlanta, thousands packed a 21-acre park, arms raised toward the morning sky, before the first steps of a justice march.
In Washington D.C., a historically black neighborhood was told it would not be forgotten, while a young girl marched in roller skates and an elder lifted up the crowds from a wood porch.
Across the country, ancestors were celebrated and black lives defended.
Thousands turned out to march for black lives in downtown Atlanta, Ga., on Juneteenth. From left, Henry Scott, Jaslyn Warren, Eric Lewis, Jr. and Valentina Mckenzie helped organize "Juneteenth- A Celebration of Freedom!," one block from the George Floyd Memorial in Minneapolis.
Tana Robbins brought her 7-yr-old twins, Clara and Bo, and 9-yr-old son Miles out to celebrate Juneteenth in Washington, D.C. Tana said she didn't know about the holiday until a week ago, but thought it was important for her children to learn about it and celebrate.
People cheered on marchers from a fire escape in Brooklyn.
Protesters marched peacefully through the streets of Brooklyn.

Kristen Carroll joined a march through Central Park to the Seneca Village site in Manhattan.
Sharon Wise rallied the crowd ahead of a peaceful march and protest to celebrate Juneteenth and call for racial equality in Ward Eight in Washington, D.C. A young girl marched in roller skates and a woman cheered on the scene from her porch in Ward Eight of Washington, D.C.
The One Race: March on Atlanta kicked off at Centennial Olympic Park at 9 a.m., with thousands of people showing up to march for Black lives and justice in America.
Demonstrators, organized by The Balance Effect Podcast in conjunction with the 100 Black Men INC, marched in solidarity to commemorate Juneteenth from Washington Square Park in Manhattan to Police Plaza. The Juneteenth flag was raised over the capitol building in Madison, Wis. for the first time, as Senator Lena Taylor of Milwaukee and the Wisconsin Legislative Black Caucus raised their fists in celebration from below.
People gathered in the early morning and set up for the "I, too, am America: Juneteenth for Justice" event on Greenwood Avenue in Tulsa where "Black Lives Matter" has been painted onto the road.

New Woe for a Jittery NYC: Illegal Fireworks Going Off All Night [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — New York, an already-jittery city transformed by the coronavirus pandemic and protests against police brutality and systemic racism, now has its own cacophonous soundtrack: illegal fireworks being set off in soaring numbers from late afternoon until the wee hours of the morning.
For some people, the fireworks serve as a release after months of boredom and seclusion in cramped apartments. For others, they are a celebration of hard-fought strides made during the demonstrations, and a show of defiance toward police.
But not everyone is enamored by the pyrotechnics. In the first half of June, 1,737 complaints about fireworks came into the city’s 311 system, 80 times as many as the 21 in the same period last year.
“These are not your normal kids playing with fireworks,” said Michael Ford, a piano teacher in Manhattan’s Inwood neighborhood. “These are real explosives, like Macy’s-style fireworks.”
Ford said that those who were firing off the explosives made it impossible for him to walk his dogs at night.
“People scream out their windows at them, but they just laugh,” he said, adding that he and his neighbors had called 911 as well as 311, but that police had not responded.
“I think it’s a lot of people who have been pent-up and need to blow off steam,” he continued. “But it’s just adding whole other layer of anxiety.”
In Brooklyn’s gentrifying Flatbush section — which has recorded hundreds of complaints, among the most of any neighborhood in the city — the daily fireworks are exposing divisions over race and class, and provoking debates about what should be reported to police.
In Harlem, the noise lasts until 1 a.m., and ranges from the pops of firecrackers to the booms of louder rockets. An officer who answered the phone at the 32nd Precinct station house Wednesday night said that police were being inundated with complaints.
“It’s as bad as anything I can remember,” said Adrian Benepe, a former city parks commissioner who lives on the Upper West Side.
“The police have had their hands full with major issues — demonstrations, looting and COVID — and they just don’t have the time to respond to quality-of-life issues like this,” Benepe said.
As of Thursday, the Police Department said it had made 26 seizures of fireworks and eight arrests and had issued 22 fireworks-related summonses so far this year. There have also been 5,947 firework-related 911 calls, compared with 1,590 for the same period in 2019.
The department would not comment on the current enforcement of fireworks laws.
While they are illegal to buy, sell or ignite in New York, fireworks are an entrenched tradition of the city’s streets, especially in working-class neighborhoods. They are generally sold from duffel bags or car trunks and set off in the days before July 4.
But this year, the unauthorized displays began at least a month earlier than usual, as other warm-weather get-togethers were halted by social-distancing rules.
And because of the virus outbreak, it remained unclear what the city’s traditional Macy’s 4th of July Firework Show would look like this year.
As measured by community board district, Flatbush and Inwood had the most 311 complaints about fireworks in the first half of June: 421 in Flatbush, up from two in the same period last year, and 250 in Inwood, up from just one.
On Monday evening in Flatbush, onlookers gathered to watch rockets that soared above rooftops and exploded in bursts of color. Ashley Rios, 27, and Kenya Smith, 26, sat on a stoop with their young daughters, who were not scared by the thunderous booms.
“They’re the ones that wanted to come out and see them,” Rios said.
But other residents said the fireworks were adding to the city’s unrest, while depriving them of sleep, upsetting pets and posing a safety issue. Messages posted on social media attested to such attitudes.
“Does Astoria sound like a war zone to anyone else?” one Queens resident tweeted recently.
This year, setting off fireworks in June has extra meaning, said a young man who was launching rockets with three friends Wednesday night in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights section.
“We’re basically celebrating the fact that we survived” the coronavirus and the quarantine, said the man, Djani, 24, who asked to be identified by only his first name because of the illicit nature of what he was doing.
“You know when you have a storm and finally the rain is letting up?” he said. “I guess it’s comparable to letting out of some aggression. People have been inside.”
He also said the fireworks were a sign of defiance toward police, “because this is illegal but we’re still doing it.”
When a young woman approached Djani and his friends, asking them to stop because the noise was disrupting her sleep and frightening her dog, they complied.
The night before, a video emerged of a fireworks display seemingly set off by firefighters in the same Brooklyn neighborhood. The Fire Department said it was investigating the matter.
The pyrotechnics have taken a physical toll, as well.
Early Wednesday in the Bronx, police officers responding to a report of gunshots instead found a teenager who had been struck in the chest while lighting off fireworks. He was hospitalized in stable condition.
In Brooklyn, a 33-year-old man was igniting fireworks inside his apartment around 5 a.m. Wednesday when a rocket backfired and struck him, police said. He was in the hospital in critical condition.
The city has a long and storied history of illicit fireworks. For decades, Inwood residents have gathered around Dyckman Street for an unsanctioned competition among neighborhood blocks that mixes rebellion with celebration.
In the 1970s and 1980s, one of the largest fireworks displays in the city could be found in Ozone Park, Queens, where it was the highlight of the lavish Fourth of July block parties funded by mob boss John J. Gotti outside his social club.
The Dyckman competitions have continued to grow over the years, said Stephen Feldheim, president of the 34th Precinct Community Council, who described them as “a cat-and-mouse game” between participants and police.
The Inwood fireworks have “increased significantly” this year, Feldheim said.
“It’s been going on for weeks, since the beginning of June,” he said, adding that police officers might be reluctant to respond to fireworks complaints now because “they’ll be targeted for police violence and not be backed by City Hall and the district attorneys for doing their job.”
“City Hall doesn’t consider fireworks real crime anymore,” Feldheim added. “So these guys can blow stuff up and get off scot-free.”
Contacted about the fireworks surge, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said that officials had “noticed an increase in incidents” and would “work with communities across the city and the NYPD to address this serious safety issue.”
In Flatbush, the fireworks have raised questions about gentrification.
When police officers showed up last weekend to crack down on the explosives in a part of the area with many Black and Hispanic residents, some people assumed it was a response to a petition created by residents of Ditmas Park, a historic district in the neighborhood, that urged the city to put a “a peaceful stop to the illegally launched fireworks that have been disrupting our sleep and our lives for weeks.”
Equality for Flatbush, which calls itself a “people of color-led, multinational grassroots organization that does anti-police repression, affordable housing and anti-gentrification/anti-displacement organizing,” lashed out at a now-deleted Facebook group, Peaceful Ditmas Park, and a law professor who helped write the petition.
Equality for Flatbush said Peaceful Ditmas Park was “a majority-white Facebook group where pro-gentrification and white supremacist sentiment is highly prevalent” and called the law professor, Irina Manta, a “Ditmas Park Karen,” using what has become shorthand for an entitled white woman.
The organization also put out a statement calling summertime fireworks “a culturally accepted norm of Brooklyn” and “an act of resistance and a show of solidarity with the global #BlackLivesMatter rebellion.”
Manta, a Hofstra University law professor, said in a brief interview that the petition had called for civilians or mediators, not the police, to bring a stop to the fireworks. She said that the petition was never submitted to city officials, and that she never contacted the police or mayor’s office.
Manta said she had received a death threat and harassing phone calls.
The fireworks are likely to continue.
In the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn on Thursday, a young man who had just set off a rocket advised onlookers to return Friday night for more.

Archivists in Washington, D.C., made a timely discovery this week: the original handwritten Union Army record of an order that brought emancipation to enslaved people in Texas at the end of the Civil War.
General Order No. 3 was read aloud by a Union officer, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, in Galveston on June 19, 1865, to inform Texans that all enslaved people in the state were free. That date, which became known as Juneteenth, has been celebrated ever since.
But the handwritten record had been buried in a leather-bound book at the National Archives in Washington, with its location largely unknown — even though, for decades, the book has been available to researchers to leaf through upon request.
The discovery was spurred by Michael Davis, a public affairs specialist for the National Archives who was writing a piece about the history of the holiday.
“In light of what has happened recently in our nation with police brutality, I wanted to make sure that we highlighted Juneteenth,” Davis said in an interview. He asked his colleagues if the archives had any documents from that day in 1865, hoping to find something but not sure that he would.
Trevor K. Plante, the director of archival operations at the National Archives building in Washington, zeroed in on the Union Army records from Texas. And Thursday, in the stacks on the 10th tier of the building’s west side, he found a leather-bound book with a June 19 entry in neat cursive.
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,” it said. “This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.”
The document, encased in its original binding, was legible and in good condition, Plante said. “It’s more powerful when you see the handwritten version of it, as opposed to the printed versions that came much later,” he added, referring to the copies of Civil War documents that were compiled by the U.S. War Department (a precursor to the Department of Defense) around the end of the 19th century.
Granger marched into Texas with about 2,000 troops in June 1865, two months after Gen. Robert E. Lee of the Confederacy surrendered to Union forces at Appomattox, Virginia, marking what some historians have called the beginning of the end of the deadliest war in American history.
The announcement would not have been a total surprise. People in Texas knew that the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed two years earlier — in fact, some slave owners had moved to Texas, the westernmost Confederate state, to escape the reach of Union enforcers.
The June 19 order did not merely call for enslaved people to be free; it also advised them to “remain at their present homes and work for wages,” and it warned that “they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”
As Davis wrote in his article Friday, “the racist language used in the last sentences foreshadowed that the fight for equal rights would continue.”
Some plantation owners in Texas resisted or delayed emancipation despite the order, and the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery across the U.S., was not ratified until December 1865. After that, Black people still faced lynchings, discriminatory laws and voter suppression, as well as white supremacist violence that continues to this day.
Still, Juneteenth became a day of celebration for generations of African American families across the U.S. who have gathered annually for parades, barbecues, music and storytelling. And this year, after weeks of nationwide protests over racism, police brutality and the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks and many others, there is a renewed interest in the history of the holiday.
Major companies like Nike, Target and Twitter have added Juneteenth as a paid holiday. And senators including John Cornyn of Texas, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Ed Markey of Massachusetts have proposed bills to make the day a federal holiday.
Davis said he was glad to see more people interested in the history and the celebration of Juneteenth. “I think it is really significant that we are able to showcase this historical document because it raises awareness about African American history,” he said.

Trump Often Asks ‘What Do You Have to Lose?’ In Tulsa, There’s Also a Waiver. [With graphic(s)]

Supporting President Donald Trump — or even taking him at his word — has always been an exercise in risk tolerance.
“What do you have to lose?” he asked Black voters in 2016, suggesting their lives were so bleak, he was worth the gamble.
“What do you have to lose?” he asked coronavirus patients this spring, suggesting their options were so few that an unproven drug, hydroxychloroquine, probably couldn’t hurt.
And now, as the nation grapples with the dual menaces of racism and a relentless virus, the once-rhetorical questions of Trump-branded risk management have given way to fine-print legal disclaimers about what might happen if people listen to him.
On Saturday, Trump is scheduled to rally at a packed indoor arena in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Many health authorities say it is a terrible idea. And what attendees have to lose, the campaign claims, is any right to hold the host responsible.
“By clicking register below,” reads a message on the Trump 2020 website, directed at those planning to be there, “you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19.”
As an encapsulation of the Trumpian worldview, some former associates say, there is perhaps no beating “guests voluntarily assume all risks.”
“You walk into his office, you’re taking a risk,” said Barbara A. Res, a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization. “Something goes wrong, you’re going to get blamed for it.”
But then, an air of danger has been embedded in Trump’s appeal from the start, the risk its own kind of reward for many in his first whirring slot machine of a presidential campaign.
What could he get away with saying before the whole enterprise went bust? Which sacred cows might fall?
What’s the worst that could happen?
“Admit It,” read a 2015 headline in The Onion, shortly after Trump became a candidate. “You People Want To See How Far This Goes, Don’t You?”
It went far. And in this moment of crisis, Trump’s instinct for dice-rolling has collided with its perils on the grandest scale.
Health officials say his impulse to play down the severity of the virus threat earlier this year informed the federal government’s haphazard response. His personal disdain for mask-wearing as a risk-mitigation measure amounts to a public safety hazard, according to medical experts, who worry about the signal it sends to his fans.
And as the pandemic cedes part of the global foreground to nationwide protests over police brutality and racial inequities, civil rights advocates say Trump’s consistent race-baiting has only exacerbated tensions in these delicate days, down to the since-abandoned decision to hold the Tulsa rally on Juneteenth.
Trump has framed the gathering as something of a defiant act regardless, swatting away any health concerns — campaign officials have said that attendees will receive masks on site but not be required to wear them — and accusing opponents of “trying to COVID Shame us on our big Rallies.”
“Won’t work!” he tweeted.
Some who know Trump believe that much of the electorate has grown tired of his fate-tempting gambits, even as they expect the 2020 race to tighten eventually against former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee who holds a solid lead in most polls.
“This was sexy and exciting in 2015, 2016,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump adviser. “But for people that have known Donald Trump for a long time like me, I was always worried that he wouldn’t wear well. And he’s at that place now, I think, where he’s not wearing well.”
Trump seems disinclined to trust anyone else’s judgment on this score, a hesitation born of experience. His life is, if nothing else, a testament to the power of salesmanship and taking chances — or at least appearing to take chances — that the risk-averse might discourage.
Throughout his business career, Trump embraced the label of risk-taker while often eliding the reality of who was assuming much of the risk, spinning failures as successes in the popular imagination.
Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, recalled the lessons the president learned from Roy Cohn, the notorious lawyer. “The school of Roy Cohn was: You can get away with almost anything,” she said, “that there is in fact not very much risk if you come into the world wealthy, insulated and have enormous political and financial clout when you’re in diapers.”
As his stature grew, Blair said, Trump aimed to “make himself big enough that he would push the risk off on everyone else, on all the lenders and banks all the way down to the lowest tradesman and subcontractor who didn’t get paid.”
For Trump, the psychological upsides were clear. “In some kind of mental jiujitsu way, he always wins,” she said. “So, personally, risk isn’t an issue.”
Politically, Trump can often appear to be operating under similar conditions. He has watched many doomsaying predictions about his behavior come and go — often, it seems, without much lasting consequence, to his mind.
Public squabbles with ostensibly sympathetic targets — mocking John McCain’s years in captivity, tussling with a Gold Star family — did not keep Trump from the White House.
Foreign policy acts criticized as reckless — swaggering tweets about North Korea; the drone attack that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian commander — have not produced a world war, even as some diplomats continue to doubt their wisdom.
This is a president who stared into an eclipse because he was curious, without scorching his eyes.
Many supporters likewise view the president as a wager validated, from voters on the Christian right who looked past his personal conduct to conservative policy minds who reasoned that he was likelier to help their cause than Hillary Clinton.
“A Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian roulette with a semi-auto,” read a widely circulated September 2016 essay in the Claremont Review of Books under the pseudonym Publius Decius Mus, urging right-leaning skeptics to come aboard. “With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.”
The author, later revealed to be Michael Anton, went on to join the Trump White House. His metaphor has persisted among those who say that any of the president’s drawbacks pale against a liberal alternative’s.
Yet rarely have the physical stakes of the Trump age been quite so literal as they will be Saturday, with a rally overriding medical warnings.
Republicans have said that the crowded protests against police violence prove that there is bipartisan agreement on the value of mass assembly even during a pandemic. Some suggested there were also cultural forces behind the outsize interest in Trump’s event, despite the health worries.
“Conservatives are more inclined to want to decide things for themselves,” said Tim Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor and Republican presidential candidate. “They may not have a lower risk tolerance, but they do have a lower tolerance for government telling them what to do.”
Of course, the leader of this government would counsel them to take the leap anyway.
In his own writings (or ghost-writings) on risk, peppered throughout his many pre-presidential how-to books, Trump has generally come down on the side of welcoming it.
Some decisions backfire, he allows. But what do you have to gain by playing it safe?
“Sometimes,” Trump advises in one tome, titled “Think Like a Champion,” “being too cautious is the greatest risk of all.”

WASHINGTON — If the Senate is to have any success at producing a bipartisan policing bill amid a nationwide outcry to address systemic racism in law enforcement, it must do something that has become exceedingly rare in the chamber: legislate.
With Democrats unwilling to accept a Republican measure that they think falls well short of the full-scale overhaul that is needed, the push to advance new controls on police will most likely require the type of free-flowing debate that has been notably absent from the Senate in recent years. Without some give on the part of both political parties, the effort is probably doomed until a reset after the November elections.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has suggested he is open to an old-style policy exchange on the floor, promising “opportunities for amendments from both sides.”
“Let me make this perfectly clear,” he said this week. “Senate Republicans are interested in making a law.”
The more frequent alternative on display in today’s U.S. Senate, of course, is making a point.
The issue will come to a head soon, when McConnell must decide how far he will go in entertaining alternatives to the Republican bill — and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader, must in turn decide whether to allow the measure to advance or block it outright.
Until Democrats know for sure what McConnell’s intent is, they do not seem eager to commit to moving forward when the Republican proposal faces its first test next week. Democrats are in no mood to accept any take-it-or-leave-it proposition from majority Republicans. McConnell has similarly declared a sweeping law enforcement overhaul drafted by House Democrats to be a nonstarter.
“Merely writing a bill, any bill, is not good enough at this moment in American history,” Schumer said Thursday. “It’s too low a bar to simply say we’ll write any old bill.”
The Senate hasn’t been very good at writing any bills at all lately, with most of the power and authorship concentrated in the leadership offices. For the most part, only must-pass spending and Pentagon measures or dire emergency response efforts like the pandemic rescue legislation even make it to the floor.
The bipartisan lands bill easily approved by the Senate this week was a rare exception and, like the others, it had tight restrictions severely limiting any attempts to change it.
McConnell, and Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader before him, both clamped down on the ability of senators to offer amendments in an effort to spare their colleagues politically tough votes and to maintain tight control of both the floor and the resulting legislation. With deep partisan divisions on virtually every issue, old-school legislating dried up, and the Senate has instead become a judicial confirmation assembly line.
As a result, many members of today’s Senate have little experience in the type of more wide-open debate that used to occur on the big issues of the day, worrying that they could be brought down by a single politically charged vote.
“These members are so risk-averse they think that every vote is the end of their career,” said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat who has been in Congress for 37 years.
As it turns out, not voting on amendments can be politically painful as well. Republicans ran against and defeated Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska in 2014 partly on a message that he was ineffective since he hadn’t even succeeded in securing a vote on one of his amendments during his six-year term. When Republicans took control of the Senate in 2015, McConnell promised to restore more no-holds-barred debates, but he steadily backslid, and full-on floor fights never materialized.
That approach will not work for the current debate on race and policing, one on which the two parties are deeply divided but also unusually motivated to get something done.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has spent the last year and a half passing Democratic legislation only to see it languish in McConnell’s Senate, said that she hoped to revive another lost congressional art for the policing bill: a bicameral negotiation in which the two chambers resolve their differences and produce a compromise.
“We would like to end up in conference, because that’s how Congress works its will,” Pelosi said Thursday. “The House acts, the Senate acts, and you go to conference and try to reconcile the legislation.”
At least, that is how it used to work. It seldom does anymore.
In the Senate, Democrats find the Republican plan, which relies on incentives to improve training and police conduct, woefully inadequate. They are pressing instead for a measure that would make it easier to prosecute and sue police officers for wrongdoing, ban brutal tactics and impose new anti-bias measures in departments across the country.
But it is not only Democrats. Rank-and-file senators in both parties have grown increasingly frustrated at being shut out of the writing of major legislation. McConnell this week faced a mini-revolt from within his own party when he used a procedural tactic called “filling the tree” to block amendments to the lands bill by fellow Republicans, some of whom took to the floor to complain about it.
Fellow Republicans say they have their own ideas about how to reshape the policing proposal from Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only African American Republican in the chamber. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., is working with Democrats on a proposal that would alter qualified immunity, which shields police officers from lawsuits, an element of the House Democrats’ bill that is likely to emerge as a central issue in the debate.
“I think it is important to trust the Senate to do the work of the Senate,” said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. “Allow the senators to be senators.”
Despite the national outcry for federal intervention in the policing crisis, both sides have strong political incentives not to act and may quickly return to their usual corners. Republicans realize they cannot go as far as Democrats would like or risk losing their crucial support on the right and at the White House. Democrats might benefit if the effort collapsed, allowing them to pound Republicans for failing to adequately respond to the crisis as they try to regain the Senate majority in the fall campaign.
But the death of George Floyd in police custody and the protests it has inspired around the country have brought about a bipartisan sense of urgency on Capitol Hill to address the issues of race and policing.
While Democrats say they think Republicans are not getting serious enough about what needs to be done, the Republican attitude has notably shifted, with leaders rushing to devise a plan to respond to the growing public clamor for change. It is a contrast to negotiations over the criminal justice overhaul in recent years, when many Republicans were worried about being portrayed as weak on law and order and refused to get behind reductions in prison sentences.
“It was like pulling teeth,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the early architects of the criminal justice legislation. “This really struck a nerve, and I think we want to try to do better.”
Senators in both parties said the legislative drive would go nowhere unless they had the chances to weigh in on possible changes. The only chance for success, they said, lies in the Senate shaking off its rust and trying to produce a genuine consensus plan.
“Let us stand up,” Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the senior member of the Senate, pleaded on the Senate floor Wednesday. “Let the U.S. Senate be the conscience of the nation again. I note that we have been in the past. Wouldn’t it be nice to be so in the present?”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump began a holiday dedicated to the end of slavery by issuing a thinly veiled threat against protesters who have been marching against systemic racism and may show up at his campaign rally Saturday evening in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bunching them together with “looters” and warning that disruptions would not be tolerated.
His tweet Friday morning, coming on the Juneteenth holiday and as many Americans grapple with the country’s racist history, was a reminder that even days of commemoration and national reflection are not free of Trump’s divisive approach to the presidency.
“Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “It will be a much different scene!”
In his tweet, Trump drew no distinction between peaceful protesters, whose right to assemble and speak out is protected by the First Amendment, and violent looters, some of whom were responsible for vandalism and fires that broke out during largely peaceful demonstrations across the country expressing outrage over the killing of George Floyd.
The Juneteenth holiday celebrates the end of slavery in the United States and has taken on added significance for many Americans this year. The White House on Friday issued a Juneteenth message that itself was discordant with Trump’s online remarks, committing to “live true to our highest ideals and to build always toward a freer, stronger country that values the dignity and boundless potential of all Americans.”
It was not clear if the president was simply using Twitter to excite his base and stir up an outcry ahead of a politically charged Saturday night or whether he planned to mobilize the National Guard or other levers of government to take to the streets of Tulsa.
Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters Friday that the president did not mean to threaten peaceful protesters. “What he was meaning are violent protesters,” McEnany said.
The Tulsa Police Department said it would not comment on the president’s tweet. “We are allowing citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights in a peaceful manner,” a spokeswoman said.
Trump’s threats, both on Twitter and off, often amount to little more than bluster. He has complained that governors and mayors have been too soft in dealing with protesters in places like New York and Seattle, but he did not follow through on a threat to send in the military if state officials did not quell the demonstrations themselves.
The rally will mark Trump’s return to the campaign trail after the coronavirus pandemic deprived him for three months of the arenas packed with die-hard fans that serve as the cornerstone of his political brand.
His return to campaign mode comes as the country grapples with its history of racial violence — a legacy that is painfully significant in Tulsa, the site of a 1921 race massacre, when up to 300 people were killed and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed in a historic black neighborhood.
In the neighborhood, known as “Black Wall Street” before the massacre, Tulsans gathered Friday to celebrate Juneteenth. The words “Black Lives Matter” had been painted across Greenwood Avenue in block letters and bright yellow paint.
Trump originally planned to hold his rally in Tulsa on Friday. But after days of criticism over the idea of holding a political rally on Juneteenth during a national uproar over racial injustice, the president agreed to postpone the event by one day. This week he tried to turn the criticism on its head, saying he was responsible for elevating the holiday’s status.
“I made Juneteenth very famous,” Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, discussing the controversy surrounding his rally. “It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.” In reality, it was his own top campaign aides who were not aware of the significance of June 19, which has been celebrated as Juneteenth by African Americans since the late 1800s.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, has tried to spin Trump’s visit to Tulsa as an opportunity to shed light on African American history. “When the Trump campaign announced the rally in Tulsa it gave the world an opportunity to learn more about and from Black Wall Street, not just the massacre but why it was so significant,” Paris Dennard, an RNC adviser for black media affairs, wrote in The Tulsa World on Thursday.
Trump is expected to land in Tulsa for his rally as coronavirus cases are rising in the city and the state overall, and as public health officials have issued warnings about the dangers of bringing together a large crowd indoors. On Wednesday, the city announced 96 new cases of the coronavirus, the largest single-day increase in Tulsa since March. Local health officials have warned that Trump’s rally has the potential to become a “super spreader” event.
Tulsa’s police chief, Wendell Franklin, said this week that his department was planning for “a mass amount of people that probably Tulsa has never seen before.”
On Thursday, Mayor G.T. Bynum signed an order imposing a three-night 10 p.m. curfew in the area around the BOK Center, where the rally is to be held, stating that the city was expecting crowds “in excess of 100,000 people in the vicinity of the rally.”
The operators of the arena, which seats 19,000, on Thursday demanded a last-minute written health and safety plan from the Trump campaign, including any plans related to social distancing. Trump and his aides have made it clear that they want to hold a packed rally with the look and feel of a pre-coronavirus event.
Bynum, a moderate Republican who is friendly with the Trump campaign, has said he is “grateful” Tulsa was chosen as the host city for Trump’s comeback rally. He said the curfew was put in place because he had received information that showed that “individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior” elsewhere were planning to travel to Tulsa “for purposes of causing unrest around the rally.”
Trump and his administration have repeatedly suggested that the sporadic violence and looting that has marred some of the protests over Floyd’s killing is an organized effort by “radical leftists,” but federal prosecutors have attributed a majority of the violent acts to individuals with no affiliation to any particular group.

In Minneapolis, Looking for Police Recruits Who Can Resist Warrior Culture [With graphic(s)]

MINNEAPOLIS — Even as the Minneapolis Police Department reels in the aftermath of its officers’ involvement in the killing of George Floyd, the department has been recruiting a new crop of trainees who will face the same challenge of every rookie: navigating the dramatic difference between what is preached at the academy and what is practiced on the street.
In the Minneapolis Police Academy, cadets are trained to be mindful of their own biases, to treat the public with respect and to use force only when necessary. But then they enter station houses and squad cars with veteran officers who may view policing differently — as an us-versus-them profession with a potential threat on every street corner.
Since Floyd’s death, the process of turning civilians into effective officers on the Minneapolis force has taken on added urgency and raised questions in the mind of one senior officer of how to tell who might be capable of abusive policing, such as pressing a knee into a suspect’s neck, as former Officer Derek Chauvin did on the evening of May 25 as three of his colleagues, two of them rookies, looked on.
“We’re just trying to hire some more right now, and I’m just sitting there — ‘How do I know which one of these guys is going to be the next Derek Chauvin?’” said Cmdr. Charles Adams, a 34-year veteran who recruits new officers and trains them on the necessity of community engagement. “How do you make that determination when their record is clean as heck? We just got to weed out the ones that don’t want to buy into the program.”
The death of Floyd has led to a national rethinking of police training. Some are urging significant reforms, while others complain that the current system is irredeemably broken, with a long history of policy changes that have failed to stop officers from resorting to violence too often, especially against black residents such as Floyd.
Floyd’s killing in police custody made clear the depth of the problem. Chauvin, who had a string of complaints against him for abusive policing, was a training officer assigned to showing new officers the ropes.
Those pushing for fundamental change in policing doubt whether enhanced training alone can overcome an entrenched culture of aggression that they feel is pervasive in the profession. They also question whether the basic requirements for getting a badge and a gun in the United States are sufficient.
It takes more than three years to become a police officer in countries like Finland and Norway, but in some U.S. states someone can complete basic training in as little as 11 weeks. Minneapolis is on the higher end of the scale, requiring more than a year of training before swearing in a new officer.
Most states require fewer minimum training hours to become licensed as a police officer than they do for barbers or cosmetologists. New York state law mandates 1,000 hours of training for massage therapists, compared with around 700 for officers. Hawaii has no minimum requirements for police officers, but manicurists must train for 300 hours.
And while many police departments require additional training, 37 states permit untrained officers to work with full authority for months before attending basic training.
“It’s insane that hairstylists need more training than cops in this country,” said Randy Shrewsberry, executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform. “We need police officers to be educated like other professionals who are given the authority of life or death or freedom. And that takes far more than increasing training by a couple of hundred hours.”
Lawmakers in Congress and state capitals have proposed measures for law enforcement training in de-escalation, use of force and dealing with mental health crises, among other situations.
In Minneapolis, Chauvin was a 19-year veteran whose job included training other officers in the field. Two of the officers he had supervised were only days into the job when they responded to a 911 call accusing Floyd of using a fake $20 bill at a corner store, a relatively minor offense.
As the two rookies and Chauvin held Floyd facedown in the street, one of the rookies suggested turning Floyd on his side, but Chauvin, the ranking officer at the scene, declined to do so, prosecutors say.
Chauvin, the two rookies and a fourth officer present were all fired and charged with crimes.
“I saw murder,” Adams said of the video of Floyd’s arrest, adding that it seemed to be a widespread sentiment within the department, even among officers who usually urge a wait-and-see approach when colleagues are accused of wrongdoing.
One frustration, Adams said, was that Chauvin’s actions erased strides he believed that the department had made to teach officers to be more accountable to communities like the predominantly black North Side, where he grew up.
Adams leads the department’s procedural justice initiatives, which include training officers on how their interactions with residents can shape public perception and affect public safety.
Implicit bias training, which the department began about eight years ago, includes discussions of the aggressive policing tactics of the 1960s that damaged public trust in law enforcement and a simulated video of an officer talking disrespectfully to a black motorist only to learn later that she was the wife of a high-ranking police officer.
But law enforcement officials and experts say de-escalation training is not enough.
“I don’t care how many new policies and laws you pass,” said Sue Rahr, a former sheriff who is executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission, which oversees training of all law enforcement officers in the state. “If we don’t address the culture, that behavior is not going to change. Period. End of story.”
Despite decades of community policing efforts, many of the nation’s police academies and 18,000 departments have long emphasized a warrior mentality, with officers trained for battle and equipped with the gear and weapons of modern warfare, she said.
The warrior culture often begins during basic training in academies modeled on military boot camp. Police academies spend around 168 hours training recruits on firearms, self-defense and use of force but only nine hours on conflict management and mediation, according to a Justice Department report.
“If you train cops like soldiers, dress them like soldiers and equip them like soldiers, you can’t be surprised that they act like soldiers, and that’s exactly what we’ve done,” said Shrewsberry, of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform. The training imbalance, he said, reinforces a “thin blue line” police culture perpetuated in many departments by higher-ups and unions. “There’s just this constant reiteration that cops are in constant danger,” he said.
Systemic reform efforts are hindered by a lack of any centralized standards for the nation’s police departments, nearly half of which employ fewer than 10 officers, according to the Justice Department. Even though many departments provide additional training, those lessons only go so far.
Washington state is widely seen as having some of the country’s highest training standards, but the police force in its largest city, Seattle, has been under federal oversight since 2012 after an investigation found that excessive force was routinely used.
“Every police agency has a mission statement, but the culture is what is accepted by leadership on a day-to-day basis,” said Sean Hendrickson, an instructor at Washington state’s police academy. “That gets backed up by other officers and is extremely deep and very difficult to change.”
Becoming a police officer in Minneapolis requires first getting a peace officer license from the state, which entails as many as 1,050 hours of training.
Once recruits obtain their licenses, they have to go through additional training run by the Minneapolis Police Department that includes 19 weeks in the academy. The department has said it does not employ warrior-style training, and the city banned such training outright last year, but the union has offered to pay for officers to receive it from outside vendors.
After completing the academy, new officers spend five months on the streets with a field training officer, who is supposed to teach recruits how to translate what they learned in the academy to real-life situations. But that is not always the case. Current and former officers pointed to one of the first things that field training officers often say to new recruits: “Forget everything you learned in the academy.”
Chief Medaria Arradondo, who has been on the Minneapolis force since 1989, said he heard it when he was coming out of the academy. That attitude is much less prevalent now, he said, but is still a concern.
“We have to lay that to rest, that old culture,” he said. “It’s about making sure that there’s ongoing training and the training in the academy just doesn’t become this subculture of a thing that you learn and you disregard.”
A former Minneapolis officer, Andrew Arashiba, said in a lawsuit against the city that during his field training in 2016 and 2017, one of his training officers told him not to activate his body camera at times when it was required unless he had notified other officers first.
The same training officer also once scolded him for not using force against a drunken older man they had encountered, according to the lawsuit. “You missed a free slap,” he recalled the training officer telling him.
“They have a culture and an unwritten practice of putting down anyone who opposes excessive use of force,” said Peter Nickitas, the lawyer for Arashiba.
Arashiba is Japanese American and is suing for racial and age discrimination after being terminated from the department in October 2017.
The emphasis on officer safety in training can make officers feel as if they will constantly be under attack in the streets, and that can be a barrier to developing meaningful relationships with the communities they serve, said Michael Friestleben, a former Minneapolis police inspector who retired three years ago.
“It was very difficult to get many of our officers to realize that the folks outside the building were not our enemies but actually our friends,” Friestleben wrote in a blunt Facebook post last month as the streets of Minneapolis erupted in protest.
When he led the 4th Precinct, on the North Side, Friestleben said he began requiring officers to attend community events. Many complained. “It’s not our job,” some said. “Everybody hates us here,” others said.
In 2015, when demonstrators set up an encampment outside of the 4th Precinct station for 18 days to protest the police killing of Jamar Clark, Friestleben spent hours each day speaking with demonstrators, he said. That elicited snarls from some of his officers.
“Who are you going to choose,” he recalled officers asking, “the police or the community?”
The department’s inability to rid the force of that attitude has brought the city to this moment of upheaval over policing and racism, Friestleben said.
“Now, today we see the results of not getting to know your community,” he wrote on Facebook, “not really serving your community, not caring about your community.”

Full text: html> FILE -- Brad Parscale, President Donald Trump's campaign manager, awaits the start of a rally in Green Bay, Wis., on April 27, 2019. Instead of offering Trump a glide path back into the campaign season, Saturday’s rally in Tulsa has become yet another flash point for a candidate who has repeatedly displayed insensitivity about race. Parscale selected the date and location of the campaign’s comeback rally. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday morning issued a thinly veiled threat to individuals who want to protest his campaign rally scheduled for Saturday evening in Tulsa, Oklahoma, adding divisive rhetoric to a Juneteenth holiday that was serving as a moment of national reflection over the country’s racist history.
“Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “It will be a much different scene!”
In his tweet, Trump drew no distinction between peaceful protesters, whose right to assemble and speak out is protected by the First Amendment, and violent looters, some of whom were responsible for vandalism and fires that broke out during largely peaceful demonstrations across the country expressing outrage over the killing of George Floyd.
Trump issued his threat on Juneteenth, a holiday that celebrates the end of slavery in the United States and that has taken on added significance for many Americans this year. The White House on Friday issued a Juneteenth message that itself was discordant with Trump’s online remarks, committing to “live true to our highest ideals and to build always toward a freer, stronger country that values the dignity and boundless potential of all Americans.”
It was not clear if the president was simply using Twitter to excite his base and stir up an outcry ahead of a politically charged Saturday night, or whether he planned to mobilize the National Guard or other levers of government to take to the streets of Tulsa. The White House, which rarely offers explanations of presidential tweets and is often taken surprise by Trump’s online declarations, did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokeswoman for the Tulsa Police Department said it would not comment on the president’s tweet. “We are allowing citizens to exercise their First Amendment rights in a peaceful manner,” she said.
Trump’s threats, both on Twitter and off, often amount to little more than bluster. He did not follow through, for an example, on a threat to send in the military if state officials did not quell protests themselves.
The rally will mark Trump’s return to the campaign trail after the coronavirus pandemic deprived him for three months of the arenas packed with die-hard fans that serve as the cornerstone of his political brand.
His return to campaign mode comes as the country grapples with its history of racial violence — a legacy that is painfully significant in Tulsa, the site of a 1921 race massacre, when up to 300 people were killed and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed in a historic black neighborhood.
Trump originally planned to hold his rally there Friday. But after days of criticism over the idea of holding a political rally on Juneteenth during a national uproar over racial injustice, the president agreed to change the date.
“I made Juneteenth very famous,” Trump said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, discussing the controversy surrounding his rally. “It’s actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.”
In reality, it was his own top campaign aides who were not aware of the significance of the date.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, has tried to spin Trump’s visit to Tulsa as an opportunity to shed light on African American history. “When the Trump campaign announced the rally in Tulsa it gave the world an opportunity to learn more about and from Black Wall Street, not just the massacre but why it was so significant,” Paris Dennard, an RNC adviser for black media affairs, wrote in The Tulsa World on Thursday, referring to the black neighborhood that was burned down in 1921 by a white mob.
The Trump rally also comes as coronavirus cases are rising in Tulsa and Oklahoma, and as public health officials have issued warnings about the dangers of bringing together a large crowd indoors.
Tulsa’s police chief, Wendell Franklin, said earlier this week that his department was planning for “a mass amount of people that probably Tulsa has never seen before.”
On Thursday, Mayor G.T. Bynum signed an order imposing a three-night 10 p.m. curfew in the area around the BOK Center, where the rally is to be held, stating that the city was expecting crowds “in excess of 100,000 people in the vicinity of the rally.”
Bynum, a moderate Republican mayor who is friendly with the Trump campaign, has said he is “grateful” Tulsa was chosen as the host city for Trump’s comeback rally. He said the order was put in place because he had received information that showed that “individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior” elsewhere were planning to travel to Tulsa “for purposes of causing unrest around the rally.”
Trump and his administration have repeatedly suggested that the sporadic violence and looting that has marred some of the protests over Floyd’s killing is an organized effort by “radical leftists,” but federal prosecutors have attributed a majority of the violent acts to individuals with no affiliation to any particular group.

Gay bars, drag shows, concerts, performances, galleries — and, of course, Pride marches. These are among the places and spaces that have long fostered camaraderie and community among LGBTQ people. Connections so often centered on in-person events, particularly in urban areas.
But this year is not like most years, not by any stretch.
In the era of the coronavirus, traveling and gathering are not options for many. But that should not hinder the spirit and mission of Pride: to remind community members and allies that they are not alone, but part of a greater push for equality, and to elevate the voices and causes central to LGBTQ people and other marginalized groups. And with the uprisings in response to the deaths of George Floyd and other black people by the police, Pride is taking on a greater significance.
“It’s more important than ever that every LGBTQ person in our community — many who are also people of color — raise their voices in protest,” Cathy Renna, the interim communications director for the National LGBTQ Task Force who is helping to organize Global Pride and NYC Pride, recently told me. The gay rights movement was sparked by an uprising, after all, one that is recognized every June. “Protest has always been a part of Pride,” she said.
And while it is disappointing not to be able to gather, as we have done for the last five decades, Renna said, the internet has been used by the community to forge connections for decades. “This is an opportunity for individuals who would never have the chance to attend a Pride march — say, in New York or Chicago or San Francisco — to be able to be part of it.
“You can be an isolated kid in the small rural town in Mississippi or you could be in Eastern Europe or you can be in a country where it’s illegal to be LGBTQ,” she said. “All you need is an internet connection.”
So charge up those computers, tablets and smartphones: This is your digital online digest for Pride month events.
(All times are Eastern, and all events are subject to change.)

New York City
June 28 at noon
For those of us in the New York area, a June without the Pride march cuts deep, especially because this year is the 50th anniversary of the first Pride march in 1970.

NYC Pride will also hold a virtual rally on June 26 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. It will be hosted by Ashlee Marie Preston, the first transgender person to openly run for state office in California, and Brian Michael Smith, a transgender actor who has starred in “Homeland,” “Queen Sugar” and “The L Word: Generation Q.” Speakers include Ceyenne Doroshow, Annie Segarra, Edafe Okporo and Leandro E. Rodriguez Ramos.
Preston will also take part in NYC Pride’s Human Rights Conference on June 25, from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Also participating are Raquel Willis, a transgender activist and writer; Jonathan Van Ness, the grooming guru from “Queer Eye” and a bestselling author; and the musical artists Shea Diamond, Cristal Ramirez and D.J.

Full text: The bill, which the mayor is likely to sign, compels the police to disclose the technology they use and data they collect.
The New York Police Department has one of the country's most sophisticated surveillance and crime-solving tool kits, with license plate readers, cellphone trackers, drones and facial-recognition software, among other technologies.
The public knows about them largely through the work of activists and civil libertarians who have fought with lawsuits and transparency requests to pry the information loose. Top police officials have traditionally resisted disclosing their methods, saying that to reveal too much would play into the hands of terrorists and criminals.
But on Thursday, the City Council passed a bill that for the first time will require the police to reveal information about their arsenal of surveillance tools, some of which may have been used in recent days at protests in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio and police officials have previously opposed the bill, but changing course this week, the mayor said he was now inclined to sign it.
The passage of the bill, known as the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology -- or POST -- Act, comes amid a flurry of efforts to overhaul the police in New York, many of them triggered by the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
Top police officials announced on Monday that they were disbanding a plainclothes unit that had been involved in numerous police shootings. Then Mayor Bill de Blasio, in an unprecedented move, said on Wednesday that he planned to put online the internal records of hundreds of officers who are facing disciplinary measures. Those actions followed others last week by state lawmakers in Albany, including a repeal of a half-century-old law that has kept police disciplinary records secret in the state.
The POST Act passed as the police department, under pressure from three straight weeks of protest, has said that it intends to move away from brute force crime-fighting strategies and rely more on intelligence gathering and technology.
The bill does not prevent the police department from employing high-tech surveillance, but it will force it to reveal what kinds of surveillance tools they use and what kinds of data it collects on New Yorkers. It was part of a package of Council-led reforms that included a ban on the police use of chokeholds and a measure requiring on-duty officers to display their badge numbers at all times.
The bill passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 44 to 6, despite the police department's continued objection.
"To be clear," a police spokeswoman wrote in a statement on Thursday, "the bill, as currently proposed, would literally require the N.Y.P.D. to advertise on its website the covert means and equipment used by undercover officers who risk their lives every day. No reasonable citizen of New York City would ever support that."
The POST Act has a troubled legislative history, having languished in committee since it was first introduced in 2017. Thirteen other cities, including San Francisco, have already adopted similar laws. And, as the country has been racked by protests stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a handful of tech firms have vowed to move away from the police surveillance business.
Last week, Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of I.B.M., sent a letter to Congress informing lawmakers that his company opposed the use of facial recognition tools, concerned they could be used for "mass surveillance" and "racial profiling." A few days later, Amazon announced that it had put in place a yearlong moratorium on selling facial recognition software to the police.
In New York City, the POST Act is supported by dozens of privacy and civil liberties groups, 70 of which sent a letter to the Council late last year denouncing the police department's acquisition of "highly-invasive technologies" like Stingray cellphone trackers and artificial intelligence programs that map out people's online social networks.
"These technologies pose a unique risk to black and brown New Yorkers who the N.Y.P.D. has subjected to dangerous, invasive policing tactics for decades," Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement praising the bill's passage. "Many of these tools have no place in the hands of law enforcement, and more action is needed to curtail N.Y.P.D. policing and surveillance abuses."
The police department has acknowledged the use of some technological methods -- though usually only under pressure from activists and civil libertarians. One of its broadest surveillance projects is the Domain Awareness System, a tool it developed with Microsoft after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 that connects the largest network of cameras, license plate readers and radiological sensors in the world.
One focal point of the department's info-tech efforts is the Real Time Crime Center, a room in Police Headquarters where a 500-square-foot video screen, connected to surveillance cameras and databases of photographs of birthmarks and scars on possible suspects, has helped investigators solve crimes for more than a decade.
Many aspects of the department's use of facial recognition have come to light only because of a lawsuit by Georgetown University Law School's Center on Privacy and Technology. The suit, which remains ongoing in Manhattan, has led to the release of a cache of internal department documents, some showing that police investigators loaded thousands of arrest photos of children and teenagers into an online database. In theory, the database could help detectives compare the faces with images from crime scenes, but evidence suggests that the technology has a higher risk of false matches in younger faces.
Other bills in the Council's package reaffirm the right of New Yorkers to record the police and require improvements in the way the department identifies problematic officers.
At a news conference in support of the POST Act on Wednesday, Albert Fox Cahn, a New York lawyer who runs the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said the law was central to curbing what he called a misuse of technology.
"This bill is going to be crucial on N.Y.P.D. surveillance," Mr. Cahn said. "This is the beginning of the end of a history of abusive policing."

NEW YORK — The New York Police Department has one of the country’s most sophisticated surveillance and crime-solving tool kits, with license plate readers, cellphone trackers, drones and facial-recognition software, among other technologies.
The public knows about them largely through the work of activists and civil libertarians who have fought with lawsuits and transparency requests to pry the information loose. Top police officials have traditionally resisted disclosing their methods, saying that to reveal too much would play into the hands of terrorists and criminals.
But on Thursday, the City Council passed a bill that for the first time will require the police to reveal information about their arsenal of surveillance tools, some of which may have been used in recent days at protests in New York. Mayor Bill de Blasio and police officials have previously opposed the bill, but changing course this week, the mayor said he was now inclined to sign it.
The passage of the bill, known as the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology — or POST — Act, comes amid a flurry of efforts to overhaul the police in New York, many of them triggered by the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.
Top police officials announced on Monday that they were disbanding a plainclothes unit that had been involved in numerous police shootings. Then de Blasio, in an unprecedented move, said Wednesday that he planned to put online the internal records of hundreds of officers who are facing disciplinary measures. Those actions followed others last week by state lawmakers in Albany, including a repeal of a half-century-old law that has kept police disciplinary records secret in the state.
The POST Act passed as the Police Department, under pressure from three straight weeks of protest, has said that it intends to move away from brute force crime-fighting strategies and rely more on intelligence gathering and technology.
The bill does not prevent the Police Department from employing high-tech surveillance, but it will force it to reveal what kinds of surveillance tools they use and what kinds of data it collects on New Yorkers. It was part of a package of council-led reforms that included a ban on the police use of chokeholds and a measure requiring on-duty officers to display their badge numbers at all times.
The bill passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 44-6, despite the Police Department’s continued objection.
“To be clear,” a police spokeswoman wrote in a statement on Thursday, “the bill, as currently proposed, would literally require the NYPD to advertise on its website the covert means and equipment used by undercover officers who risk their lives every day. No reasonable citizen of New York City would ever support that.”
The POST Act has a troubled legislative history, having languished in committee since it was first introduced in 2017. Thirteen other cities, including San Francisco, have already adopted similar laws. And, as the country has been racked by protests stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a handful of tech firms have vowed to move away from the police surveillance business.
Last week, Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, sent a letter to Congress informing lawmakers that his company opposed the use of facial recognition tools, concerned they could be used for “mass surveillance” and “racial profiling.” A few days later, Amazon announced that it had put in place a yearlong moratorium on selling facial recognition software to the police.
In New York City, the POST Act is supported by dozens of privacy and civil liberties groups, 70 of which sent a letter to the council late last year denouncing the police department’s acquisition of “highly-invasive technologies” like Stingray cellphone trackers and artificial intelligence programs that map out people’s online social networks.
“These technologies pose a unique risk to black and brown New Yorkers who the NYPD has subjected to dangerous, invasive policing tactics for decades,” Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement praising the bill’s passage. “Many of these tools have no place in the hands of law enforcement, and more action is needed to curtail NYPD policing and surveillance abuses.”
The Police Department has acknowledged the use of some technological methods — though usually only under pressure from activists and civil libertarians. One of its broadest surveillance projects is the Domain Awareness System, a tool it developed with Microsoft after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 that connects the largest network of cameras, license plate readers and radiological sensors in the world.
One focal point of the department’s info-tech efforts is the Real Time Crime Center, a room in Police Headquarters where a 500-square-foot video screen, connected to surveillance cameras and databases of photographs of birthmarks and scars on possible suspects, has helped investigators solve crimes for more than a decade.
Many aspects of the department’s use of facial recognition have come to light only because of a lawsuit by Georgetown University Law School’s Center on Privacy and Technology. The suit, which remains ongoing in Manhattan, has led to the release of a cache of internal department documents, some showing that police investigators loaded thousands of arrest photos of children and teenagers into an online database. In theory, the database could help detectives compare the faces with images from crime scenes, but evidence suggests that the technology has a higher risk of false matches in younger faces.
Other bills in the council’s package reaffirm the right of New Yorkers to record the police and require improvements in the way the department identifies problematic officers.
At a news conference in support of the POST Act on Wednesday, Albert Fox Cahn, a New York lawyer who runs the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said the law was central to curbing what he called a misuse of technology.
“This bill is going to be crucial on NYPD surveillance,” Cahn said. “This is the beginning of the end of a history of abusive policing.”

When Shaniyat Chowdhury, a Democratic candidate for Congress in New York, was asked about the most urgent concern facing his district, his options were not in short supply. He could have said housing or hunger. Health care was certainly on the table. But when prompted in a local news interview to name what he intends to do about his “single most pressing issue,” the 28-year-old democratic socialist had this answer: reparations, to address centuries of racial injustice.
Chowdhury was raised in public housing in Queens. His father waited tables and his mother cleaned hotel rooms. His parents immigrated from Bangladesh, but growing up he noticed that many neighbors who lived like him, in poverty, were black.
He remembers the fifth grade teacher who taught him about slavery, the “original sin” of the country his own family came to seeking economic opportunity. Two decades later, he is running for Congress to reckon with that history.
“It’s about more than a check,” he said in a recent interview. “It’s about improving the quality of life for black Americans. It’s about addressing the sins of this nation over 400 years.”
For some scholars who have studied reparations for decades, that’s a remarkable sentiment to hear from a congressional candidate, even one running in a deep-blue Queens district.
Rep. John Conyers, who died in 2019, was a long-serving Democrat from Michigan and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He introduced a bill on the study of reparations every year beginning in 1989 and said he would “do so until it’s passed into law.” (He did, until he resigned in 2017.) For years, the prospect of the bill becoming law seemed quite distant. Gallup polling has shown that more than two-thirds of Americans oppose reparations. President Barack Obama said in 2016 that he considered the idea impractical.
Slowly, though, the notion has gained political traction. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, reintroduced Conyers’ bill, which would establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and make recommendations for its “apology and compensation” in 2019, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., introduced companion legislation in the Senate. Last year on Juneteenth, an annual holiday commemorating the ending of slavery, a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a first-of-its-kind hearing on reparations.
“This is a nation that has gone through slavery, Reconstruction, lynching, Jim Crowism,” Jackson Lee said Thursday. “We’re in a new era. We have the hearts and minds of the American people. That’s why I think reparations will pass.”
But few political candidates have featured the issue front and center in their campaigns. “It was somewhat of a verboten topic for political figures in the past,” said William Darity, a public policy professor at Duke University and author of “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century.” “There’s been a real fear that there could be a political penalty from the white electorate from any intimation that you might seriously consider it.”
In the past year, that attitude appears to have shifted: “It’s striking to me that people campaigning to be elected officials are mentioning the word at all,” Darity said. “There seems to be a sea change.”
Candidates around the country have found the idea of reparations to be a powerful way of engaging young progressive voters. Charles Booker, the state legislator running in the Democratic primary to challenge Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, in Kentucky, mentions reparations on his campaign website, noting his own family’s history of lynching and enslavement. Jamaal Bowman, running in the Democratic primary against Rep. Eliot Engel in New York, has said that he believes in reparations, citing author Ta-Nehisi Coates’ testimony at last year’s congressional hearing.
While the political push has long come from veteran black lawmakers, white candidates are discussing the issue of reparations too. At a recent Senate primary debate between Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy, both the Massachusetts Democrats said they were open to the idea. Kennedy said in an interview that the conversation should “go beyond debate over a study” of the issue, where the legislative focus has remained for decades.
Andrew Romanoff, a Democratic candidate for Senate in Colorado, announced that he supports reparations for both Native and black Americans during a recent primary debate. Romanoff started his career working at the Southern Poverty Law Center and later led an undercover investigation on employment discrimination for a state civil rights agency. He has made racial justice a central part of his policy platform.
“Like other big ideas, reparations is one arriving more swiftly to the realm of the possible,” he said. “For a long time it was stuck in a debate over the mechanics and the money. How much would it cost? The first step is to recognize the moral obligation.”
The mechanics are no doubt fiercely debated; reparations has been used to describe a variety of proposals, although at its heart refers to financial compensation from the government to the descendants of enslaved people. Romanoff, and many others, looks to the precedent set by Germany in paying reparations to victims of the Holocaust when arguing for the plausibility of a similar effort in the United States.
Romanoff said he has heard voters describe reparations as “too extreme” or “too far left.” But he views its polling popularity as “beside the point” and said he sees his campaign as an opportunity to educate voters about the feasibility of ideas that may seem politically unpalatable.
“If you agree it’s the right thing to do, then the fact that it may not poll well isn’t a concern,” Romanoff said. “Consensus doesn’t magically materialize, it has to be forged.”
Some polls indicate that current conditions may be ripe for forging consensus on issues that long seemed beyond the sphere of political possibility. In the two weeks after the killing of George Floyd, public support for the Black Lives Matter movement increased almost as much as it had in the preceding two years. The idea of defunding or abolishing the police, which was for years relegated primarily to the realm of a hashtag, has inched closer to reality in Minneapolis, where a veto-proof majority of the City Council has pledged to disband its police department.
And the country has now seen both a public health crisis and an economic crisis that disproportionately hurt black Americans. “Whenever we have an economic shock, you see black people have a harder time recovering because of historical discrimination connected to the wealth gap,” said Andre Perry, a Brookings Institution fellow and a co-author of a recent report on reparations. “Now you see how easily we found money to give out when white people were suffering because of COVID and you scratch your head.”
Practicality is not the only impediment mentioned. A nationwide poll conducted last year found that while a majority of black Americans favor reparations, they think of the proposal as less helpful than other progressive policies such as a higher minimum wage and stronger anti-discrimination laws.
The country’s first systematic attempt to offer a form of reparations for slavery came when Union Gen. William Sherman issued an order, in 1865, promising 40 acres, and later a mule, to former slaves. The idea originated in a conversation the general and War Secretary Edwin Stanton held with 20 leaders of the black community in Savannah, Georgia. But Andrew Johnson, President Abraham Lincoln’s successor, overturned the order months later. (The name of the House reparations bill, H.R. 40, is a reference to those promised 40 acres.)
“With 40 acres and a mule, what slaves were asking for was the ability to become functioning members of society, by working,” said Royce West, a Texas state senator who is running in a Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. At a recent debate he said he leans in favor of reparations; his opponent, M.J. Hegar, did not go that far, saying she would want to study the issue further. “That particular promise was never kept by government because the politics did away with it,” he added.
More than a century and a half later, West is hopeful that the politics constraining that unfulfilled promise have changed. “Right now you have corporate America throwing money at the problem,” he said, referring to the million of dollars poured into racial justice organizations in recent weeks. “The question is how will that money be spent.”
It’s not just corporations — hundreds of thousands of Americans have taken to the streets marching for racial justice in recent weeks. Amid the unrest, some candidates have found the idea of reparations to be a powerful way of engaging young progressive voters. Darity said younger Americans also seem to view reparations more favorably than older generations; polling in 2016 showed that nearly 4 out of 5 baby boomers tend to oppose the idea, while more than half of millennials say they are either in favor or unsure.
“Young people across races are very excited about it,” said Bowman, one of the Democratic congressional candidates in New York who has made reparations part of his pitch.
“Voters have been telling me this is long past due. For a very long time we’ve talked about the study of the need for reparations, but the data is already available,” he added, citing low health, education and economic outcomes for black Americans.
And one more data point: The Black Lives Matter rallies he has attended in predominantly white neighborhoods, and with large, diverse crowds, have made him think that what once seemed to so many as a political impossibility could be closer to reality.

Pelosi Orders Removal of Four Confederate Portraits From the House [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered portraits of four speakers who served the Confederacy to be removed from the Capitol on Thursday, the latest in a wave of efforts across the country to purge public spaces of historic symbols associated with racism and oppression.
On the eve of Juneteenth, the day that honors the end of slavery in the United States, Pelosi, of California, banished the paintings from the speaker’s lobby, the grand corridor outside the House chamber where the portraits of her predecessors are displayed.
As Cheryl L. Johnson, the House clerk, and six reporters looked on, workers for the architect of the Capitol mounted ladders and carefully removed the paintings, wheeling them off and leaving empty hooks and blank patches of wall where they had hung in gilded frames.
“As I have said before, the halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to Johnson requesting the removal of the portraits. “There is no room in the hallowed halls of Congress or in any place of honor for memorializing men who embody the violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy.”
The portraits are of Robert M.T. Hunter of Virginia, Howell Cobb of Georgia, James L. Orr of South Carolina and Charles F. Crisp of Georgia. Crisp served in the Confederate army as a young man and entered politics in the 1870s; the others were in Congress before the Civil War, and then held high civilian office in the Confederacy.
The paintings were loaded onto two dollies Thursday afternoon, each placed between pieces of foam board, and transported to the House collection storage.
The removal of the portraits was part of a broader rethinking by lawmakers about how American history is depicted and remembered inside the walls of the Capitol, which was built by slaves. The discussion comes as the nation grapples with a wide-ranging conversation about racism and justice after the death of George Floyd in police custody.
As speaker, Pelosi has unilateral power over portraits in the House, but her efforts to remove statues of 11 Confederate officials and soldiers — including Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, the president and vice president of the Confederate States of America — from the Capitol have been met with resistance. Current federal law gives states the power to remove a statue, as they are selected and donated by states for display in the Capitol, and top Republicans have indicated they believe states should maintain that responsibility.
“Individuals who committed treason against the United States of America and led our nation into its most painful and bloody war to preserve the institution of slavery are not patriots and should not be afforded such a rare honor in this sacred space,” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor. “The continued presence of these statues in the halls of Congress is an affront not just to black Americans, but to the very ideals we as a nation proclaim, that we are a place of liberty and justice for all.”
But when Booker tried to win unanimous approval of a bill to remove statues of Confederate officials from Capitol Hill, the move was blocked by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who leads the bipartisan committee that oversees such requests.
“It would have the effect of abandoning agreements that we have entered into with the states and the states have entered with us,” Blunt said of the proposal, noting that some states had already moved to replace their statues, four of which Pelosi had singled out. “This is a more complicated arrangement than the activity on the floor today would suggest.”
Blunt, however, said he planned to further examine the legislation. He is also one of several Republicans who signaled support for a provision in a must-pass military policy bill that would require the Pentagon to strip bases and equipment of Confederate names, monuments or symbols in three years.
President Donald Trump has condemned the provision and said he would not even consider such changes, leaving open the possibility of an election-year clash between him and Congress over whether to honor Confederate figures.

‘Dear White Women’: The Public Classroom of Rachel Cargle [With graphic(s)]

Today’s lesson in the virtual classroom of Rachel Elizabeth Cargle, a public academic, writer and lecturer, is “to give a more critical lens” for people “to view how they exist in the world.”
For the mostly white “classroom” that is her Instagram account — “white women make up about 75% of my follower count,” according to Cargle — it means coming to terms with the structural implications of their power and privilege and reconsidering how they show up in the world. For black followers, it is affirmation that daily racist treatment is not a figment of their imagination.
In just the last month, Cargle’s Instagram account has grown in followers from 355,000 to 1.7 million, as many in the country are grieving and grappling with the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks and George Floyd.
“It’s been really heavy for me to have so many followers come to me under the weight of more police brutality, more black people dying,” she said.
The number of race-related titles, including “White Fragility” and “How to Be Anti-Racist,” currently on The New York Times bestseller lists is telling. There is an educational scramble happening.
She uses her Instagram as a tool to influence but her work is also as a consultant who gets asked by corporations and groups to share her knowledge.
Cargle assumes that if you have shown up to her class, you are ready to do the hard and gritty work of learning and unlearning — described as “curiosity for what is possible in the world,” as she puts it.
Her expectation is that creating lessons and content “that speaks to the white community will affect the way white people show up in the world and the way they interact with the black people they exist with.” Her lecturing and professional speaking work follows this route, as well, often addressing itself directly to white people.
Example-based learning is a go-to in Cargle’s lesson plans. She often uses it to help her students develop new skills, like understanding the difference between intention and impact. Her “Saturday School Lesson” is a recurring digital series in which she dissects recent comments and direct messages she has received, with annotations to illuminate their fallacies.
Recently, Cargle explained why good intentions do not negate a harmful impact. Instead she said, “you apologize, acknowledge the pain you caused and exist more carefully and intentionally.”
“I value the millions of people coming to hear my voice, I just hope that people recognize that I and other anti-racism activists whose numbers are also continuing to grow are not performing,” she said.
“I’m deeply invested in the ability to be my dynamic self and not just one who’s surviving white supremacy,” Cargle said, and she does so by sharing, albeit cautiously, relatable snippets of her personal life — her dog Ivy, charcuterie boards, books. She also makes a conscious effort to remind her followers, “you’re actually my readers and you’re actually my students and you’re actually a part of a conversation and this is a space where we’re learning.”
A path to the free classroom
When asked how she makes sense of her unconventional career path, teaching and lecturing outside the academy and via social media, Cargle said, “the two greatest gifts that my mother ever gave me was curiosity and my love of reading.” In between soccer practice and Girl Scout meetings in Green, Ohio, in a childhood she described as “very good and pretty lovely,” it’s fairly easy to connect the dots to her current race-related work. She spent hours poring through encyclopedias and reading whatever her mother had lying around the house, like Maya Angelou and Sister Souljah. “I always considered being either a teacher or a lawyer,” she said.
“We lived in Section 8 housing inside of a very rich suburb,” she said, which made her hyper-aware of the social and economic differences between her white classmates and herself. Despite getting the same grades and participating in the same after-school activities it became clear, she said, that “there’s something about us that’s different but there’s nothing about me that makes me less worthy.”
This chasm only became more stark in middle school.
One of Cargle’s earliest memories of race was in the sixth grade. She was told by her crush, who was white, that they would never be a couple because she was black. Though she laughs now about the innocence of a first crush, the sting still lingers.
Left to fester, this treatment crystallizes into shame and a sense of inferiority, but for Cargle that was not the case. “My mom taught me that I deserved to be heard and treated fairly and not to back down from people who were in power,” she said. She was encouraged to use her voice to fight for justice, no matter the power dynamics at play, and to work to be a part of conversations.
After high school, Cargle spent two years at the University of Toledo. She recalled being blown away in her first anthropology and sociology classes on campus.
“There were all these aspects of society I hadn’t considered and I was given a critical lens to start to consider how I exist in the world, how I relate to others,” she said.
She briefly attended Columbia University in 2018.
“It gave me a dynamic classroom experience and I did learn a lot from my time there,” she said.
She left the university following a racist incident that took place on campus in 2019. While she does not credit her formal education to how she teaches, “the Columbia classroom gave me tools on how to best facilitate meaningful conversation.”
“I recognized there was no way I would be able to move through the world without social justice being a part of my work because it was a part of who I am existing in a black body, a female body,” Cargle said.
‘Rest is a part of the revolution’
While she is unwaveringly committed to fighting for justice, fighting does get exhausting. In an effort to skirt the often dire physical and emotional implications that social justice work can have — like in the case of activist Erica Garner, daughter of Eric Garner, who died at just 27 — she holds steadfast to the mantra that rest is a part of the revolution.
“In a world that’s constantly putting black people in a space of exhaustion, lack, labor, both physical and emotional, so I’m really leaning into the reality that me resting my black body, my black heart, my black mind is just as a part of the revolution as any other part of my work,” she said.
She’s also leaning into joy.
That means: Laughing often, calling friends, going through pictures, reminiscing about funny stories with the black people in her community. Her foundation, the Loveland Foundation, is work that is also for her another source of joy.
“Black women are the bedrock of so many aspects of our community, our homes, our churches, our neighborhoods,” Cargle said, “and so I have the gratefulness that the foundation is giving women healing which will undoubtedly give healing to every other aspect of the black community.”

A top federal law enforcement official involved in the decision this month to forcibly clear hundreds of peaceful protesters near the White House was accused as a U.S. Park Police patrol officer nearly two decades ago of conducting unlawful body cavity searches and providing unreliable testimony, according to interviews and court records.
The official, Gregory Monahan, now the acting chief of the Park Police, was repeatedly cleared of wrongdoing. He now leads the force that gave the order to use pepper balls and other irritants to carry out a directive to clear Lafayette Square before President Donald Trump’s widely criticized visit to a nearby church June 1, and he is a key decision-maker in the federal government’s response to the continuing protests against police violence.
The episode at Lafayette Square is the latest controversy for the Park Police, which prosecutors and defense lawyers say has a reputation for fostering a “cowboy” culture where rules are not of paramount importance. The Park Police, a force of about 600 officers that is part of the National Park Service inside the Interior Department, has jurisdiction over the nation’s federal parks, including the many that dot Washington as well as some highways surrounding the capital.
If demonstrators continue to gather in the parks around the White House and Washington’s monuments, the Park Police will be the primary force that polices their actions.
In a statement in response to questions about Monahan, Alexandra Picavet, a National Park Service spokeswoman, said all “the referenced cases were investigated, and the allegations were determined to be unfounded.” She added that all of Monahan’s actions and testimony were appropriate and that the chief, “throughout his decades of public service as a law enforcement officer, has served with distinction, putting his life on the line to protect citizens in upholding the law.”
Monahan, 48, joined the Park Police in 1997. He was investigated at least four times from 1999 to 2004 on accusations of conducting unlawful body cavity searches, according to a 2004 letter written by Kenneth Wainstein, then the U.S. attorney in Washington, to a defense lawyer in a separate case involving Monahan. In one of the four cases, federal prosecutors declined to prosecute him; the Park Police cleared him in two others, and another investigation was pending at the time.
In a fifth case, a federal judge in northern Virginia suppressed evidence from the stop of a black motorist whom Monahan pulled over for a cracked windshield in 2002 on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a highway near Washington that the Park Police have jurisdiction over. He searched the man, Arrion Ford, for drugs by putting his gloved hand in the man’s buttocks on the side of the busy road, according to court documents.
Monahan had testified that he did nothing wrong. He said he searched Ford because he saw him “clinching his buttocks,” suspected he was carrying drugs, patted him down and found a package of crack cocaine. The officer said that during his first six years on the force he had made 500 drug arrests and estimated that in 20% of those cases, suspects had hidden drugs in their buttocks.
Ford gave a different account. He testified that after pulling down his shorts and underwear, Monahan, with the help of two other officers, “spread my butt cheek, and then he went, excuse me, went to my rectum and retrieved the item, the contraband that he said I had,” according to a court transcript of the suppression hearing.
Judge Gerald Lee, in a scathing decision, said he simply did not believe Monahan’s testimony. Lee said that the search was unconstitutional and emphasized that it took place in broad daylight. The case was ultimately dismissed.
Picavet said that the Park Police asked federal prosecutors at the time to seek a “reconsideration” of Lee’s decision but that the request was denied. She said that Monahan later testified in numerous other cases and that “his testimony and actions were found to be credible.”
But on another occasion, Lee, who at the time was sitting in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, dismissed another drug case involving a motorist that Monahan had stopped on suspicion of failing to wear a seat belt. The judge said he did not find Monahan’s account of the 2002 episode — which resulted in the arrest of the man, Rasheed McDaniel — to be credible, in part because of Monahan’s testimony in another case.
“Analyzing Officer Monahan’s demeanor on the witness stand, his testimony about his observations, and considering his previous questionable veracity before this court in another traffic stop on the Parkway, the court finds improbable that Officer Monahan observed a passenger not wearing his seat belt as the vehicle was traveling past him for a fleeting second at 1 o’clock in the morning,” Lee wrote in a January 2003 decision.
Lee, who is now retired, declined to comment further on the case but said that he stood by the statements he made in court that he found Monahan to be untruthful.
In all, federal judges suppressed evidence in at least a half-dozen criminal cases during the years that Monahan patrolled either national parks in Washington or highways under Park Police jurisdiction in northern Virginia, according to defense lawyers and a review of court filings.
“Monahan had, by far, more cases, thrown out because of police misconduct than any other officer I’ve ever dealt with,” said Geremy Kamens, who heads the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Eastern District of Virginia and represented Ford in the 2002 case.
Those allegations were not an obstacle to Monahan’s ascent. He was promoted to detective sergeant by 2007, captain in 2012, major in 2015 and assistant chief of police in July 2019. He was named acting chief in September 2019 after the previous head of the force, Robert MacLean, was promoted.
Monahan joined the Park Police after getting a bachelor’s degree in business administration from St. Bonaventure University in New York, according to his LinkedIn profile. In 2015, his profile said, he earned an advanced degree in public administration from the University of Nebraska-Omaha. The son of a former New York City police officer, he and his family have been active in raising money for a charitable group that supports families of deceased police officers.
Just before he was named acting chief, Monahan served as the supervisor of the patrol officers at the Presidio, a national park in San Francisco — while largely working from offices in Washington, according to a union complaint against him.
While he was in that post, the union that represents the Park Police accused Monahan of asking federal prosecutors to dismiss misdemeanor charges against several people accused of assaulting officers in the Presidio. The union filed a complaint with the federal prosecutor’s office in San Francisco about Monahan, saying he wanted the charges dismissed to curry favor with Interior Department officials.
Charges against the suspects were eventually dismissed. The union’s complaint is pending before the Interior Department’s independent inspector general.
Monahan has more recently faced criticism for a statement he issued after the havoc this month in Lafayette Square in which he said no tear gas was used on protesters. The U.S. Secret Service, which worked with the Park Police in securing the area, had at first also denied the use of tear gas. But later, the Park Police acknowledged that officers had fired pepper balls on the crowd.
Two Park Police officers were put on administrative duty pending an investigation into allegations they assaulted an Australian TV crew filming the protests in Lafayette Square.
The encounter came three years after a minor traffic accident in 2017 when Park Police officers fired nine shots at close range into the car of a 25-year-old Virginia man, Bijan Ghaisar, hitting him in the head four times. He died 10 days later. The officers claimed that Ghaisar failed to stop his vehicle.
The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington investigated but determined it had insufficient evidence to charge the officers. A local prosecutor in Virginia has vowed to investigate the shooting but accused the FBI this spring of withholding hundreds of related documents.

The broken bones, separated shoulders and concussions are the cost of doing business for a jockey. They climb atop 1,100-pound horses, after all, push them to speeds of 35 mph, and maneuver them inches apart in a crowded field of as many as 13 other colleagues atop their own hurtling thoroughbreds. Javier Castellano has experienced the toll of those injuries and is prepared for those risks.
What the Hall of Fame rider Castellano was not ready for was a call from the health department in Broward County, Florida, in late March, telling him that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. He had just run 3 miles in the sweltering South Florida heat, getting ready for a weekend of lucrative stake races.
“Do you have the right Castellano?” he asked the voice on the other end of the phone. He had just returned from New York, he explained, where he had sheltered in his Long Island home with his family, not even going to the grocery store.
They did.
“What do I do?” he asked.
He was told to stay home for 14 days, but that presented another dilemma. When Castellano, 42, rides the winter meet in South Florida at Gulfstream Park, he stays with his 64-year-old mother, Neila Castellano. When he told her that he was checking into a hotel, she was having none of it.
“You don’t go anywhere. I’ll take care of you,” she said. “God will take care of us. We will take care of each other.”
On Saturday, Javier Castellano will ride Farmington Road in the 152nd running of the Belmont Stakes. Do not mistake that for a return to normal for Castellano or for thoroughbred racing.
Over the past three months, Castellano, has twice quarantined away from his wife and three children, sitting idly while missing scant opportunities to ride. Jockeys are the ultimate gig workers of the athletic world. They are self-employed and must finish first, second or third in a race to collect a meaningful paycheck. Until this month, horse racing was largely shut down across much of the United States.
This week, the Belmont Stakes will hardly be the “Test of the Champion” that horse racing aficionados have come to know and love.
Instead of being the final leg of the Triple Crown, it will kick off the series for the first time because of the postponements of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes to the fall. Instead of 150,000 people filling the grandstands on Long Island, there will be no spectators and only a bare-bones staff of grooms, trainers and assistant starters who will wear masks and practice social distancing. Instead of its grueling, mile-and-half distance, the race has been shortened to a mile and an eighth.
Still, Castellano’s convalescence could have been worse. He had a sore throat and mild headache along with more than a few panic attacks. He got them early in the public health crisis, when accurate information was low and anxiety was higher.
“No one really could tell me what to expect. It was mentally hard,” Castellano said. “You wonder if you are going to wake up tomorrow unable to breathe, or if you are going to see your kids again.”
One morning, his mother woke up with a cough and a headache.
“I was scared — what did I do to my mother?” he said. Fortunately, it was a false alarm and Neila recovered quickly.
Two weeks later, after testing negative for the virus, Castellano returned to New York, where the racetracks had already been shut down. He spent 10 days at home helping his wife, Abby, with the distance learning of his daughters Kayla, 14, and Sienna, 11, and to keep his 7-year-old son, Brady, calm.
In the meantime, Castellano’s agent, Jon Panagot, scrambled to find his rider some work. About the only place running where they had clients was Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. But, because New York was in its most deadly days of the pandemic, the track required riders from the state to quarantine for two weeks somewhere else before being allowed to ride. So Castellano returned to Florida and went to his mother’s house.
“He was isolated from his family and, like a lot of people, needed to work,” Panagot said. “He can’t work from home.”
Not only does Castellano need a horse to ride, he must win to collect 10% of the first-place check; or finish second or third to collect 5% of those purses. There is no collective bargaining agreement. There are no guaranteed salaries — exorbitant or otherwise.
If Castellano finishes fourth or worse during races at Belmont, he picks up a $125 mount fee. Panagot gets 25% of that and Castellano’s valet, who takes care of his equipment, gets 5%. By the time Castellano pays them and various other fees, half of his mount fee is gone.
“If I finish fourth by a hair, I’ve risked my life for $60,” Castellano said.
Still, Castellano knows how fortunate he is to be back at work during the pandemic. For 23 years now, he has been diligent enough in the early mornings at the racetrack working out horses that he wants to ride in the afternoon. He twice won the Preakness Stakes and is a member of the horse racing Hall of Fame.
Castellano is talented enough that of the nearly 29,000 mounts he has had 5,259 of them have ended up in the winner’s circle. Altogether, the horses that Castellano has ridden have won more than $345 million in purses. When Belmont Park opened last month for training, Castellano grasped for what he felt was normalcy — even if it came with face masks and gloves.
“When you touch the ground at the track, you forget about everything,” he said. “It’s so competitive and you are doing something you love.”
Then, George Floyd was killed in police custody in Minneapolis, touching off weeks of protests in a country already reeling from the pandemic and rocketing joblessness. The world outside the racetrack became even more complicated.
The jockeys’ room in New York, like the city itself, is a melting pot. Castellano is Venezuelan, Jose and Irad Ortiz are from Puerto Rico, Luis Saez is from Panama and Kendrick Carmouche is African American.
On the opening day of Belmont’s meet, every rider in the colony came to the paddock before the first race and stood for a moment of silence to honor those who died of COVID-19, and as a nod to medical professionals. Then, Castellano and his colleagues took a knee in solidarity with protesters calling for changes to policing.
What had he learned from a harrowing three months?
“We got to pray for each other,” Castellano said. “We got to love each other more.”

New York City Will Enter Next Phase of Reopening Monday, Mayor Says [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — New York City, once the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, will enter its next phase of reopening on Monday, with as many as 300,000 employees expected to return to their jobs as outdoor dining, in-store shopping and office work resumes, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday.
The move will put the city one step further on its path to economic recovery from a devastating virus that killed more than 21,000 residents and triggered one of the strictest shutdowns in the United States.
“I’m very comfortable now saying that we will start Phase 2 on Monday,” de Blasio told reporters at his daily briefing.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said later on Thursday that the state would not make its final decision on easing more restrictions until Friday, but was still advising businesses to prepare for it, given recent testing and hospital data.
“My advice to New York City businesses: Plan to reopen Monday in Phase 2,” the governor said.
De Blasio’s announcement comes as other states that moved more swiftly to reopen have seen spikes in new infections. Arizona, Florida, Nevada, Oregon and Texas all reported their largest one-day increases in new cases this week.
Yet New York has shown a steep decline in new cases since the virus peaked in April, when there were more than 10,000 new cases reported on several days. On Thursday, the state reported another 618 cases, or about 0.90% of all tests processed the day before — the lowest rate since the beginning of the outbreak, according to the governor.
Under the state’s reopening plan, outdoor dining, some in-store shopping, hair salons, barbershops, real estate firms and offices in the city would be allowed to open up in the second phase, with social distancing and restrictions on capacity. Playgrounds will also reopen during Phase 2, de Blasio said.
The newly reopened businesses will likely offer a jolt of energy to New York City’s streets, which had been eerily quiet as the state’s lockdown orders shuttered businesses and kept residents at home.
Restaurant owners, who have seen business plummet during the pandemic, have been particularly worried that even as the city reopened, regulations requiring them to limit capacity and put distance between their tables would make it hard for them to make ends meet.
Many restaurants and bars in New York City, especially in Manhattan, do not have available outdoor space, and owners have for weeks pressed lawmakers to expand their ability to serve customers outdoors as the city reopened.
As the city first began easing restrictions earlier this month, a kind of informal outdoor dining emerged, with large groups eating and drinking on streets outside businesses that were open for takeout.
On Thursday, de Blasio said that restaurants in the city would be able to place seating in curbside parking areas and on sidewalks adjacent to their restaurants, even if those establishments had never provided outdoor seating before.
He also announced that beginning in July, the city would allow restaurant seating on the 43 miles of streets that it had closed as part of its Open Streets program. Under the program, roads were closed to vehicle traffic in an effort to provide more outdoor space to residents and prevent crowding at city parks.
“Outdoor dining is the way forward,” de Blasio said.
The mayor predicted that the expansion of outdoor dining could prevent 5,000 of the city’s restaurants from closing and avoid the loss of 45,000 jobs. For restaurants that do not already have outdoor seating permits, an expedited application process will begin on Friday, officials said.
Ted Pavlakos, a manager at Hudson Clearwater in the West Village, which has a popular patio as well as sidewalk seating, said the restaurant was “absolutely ready to open on Monday for outdoor seating.”
In recent days, he said, customers have been stopping by the restaurant in-person and calling to see when the patio would reopen. Many, he added, seem to be “itching to come back.”
“We can’t wait to have people back in,” Pavlakos said. “I’m really curious to see the general vibe will be.”
Still, not all New York business owners were excited by the prospect of entering Phase 2.
Lexi Beach, the owner of Astoria Bookshop, an independent bookstore that has been offering curbside pickup, said she was concerned the city was “moving too quickly” and that she doubted that she would allow customers into her store on Monday.
“It’s not that we want to be operating slowly and with a bottleneck of pickups by appointment,” she said. “It’s that this is the way that we can do it to minimize risk. I don’t even want to say it’s the ‘safe’ way to do it.”
Beach also expressed deep frustration about what she said was poor communication by the city and state about what the phases actually entail.
She noted that customers have been showing up at her store during Phase 1, under the false impression that they can come inside and browse. And as a business owner, she said she has not received any guidance on how to ensure she maintains a steady supply of disinfectants and other cleaning materials required to keep customers and employees safe.
“It’s very complicated,” she said, “and I am not happy that we are moving into Phase 2 so quickly.”
De Blasio and Cuomo have also repeatedly emphasized the need for caution as the city prepared for Phase 2, with both suggesting they could still delay reopening if the test results over the weekend showed a spike in new cases.
Cuomo, pointing to issues in other states, urged New Yorkers to continue social distancing and wearing masks in order to prevent a second wave of infections.
Earlier this week, the governor threatened to reinstate closures in the city after a number of photos and videos spread online of people flouting social-distancing rules and congregating outside Manhattan bars.
On Thursday, as the city prepared to expand outdoor dining, Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing the state to immediately suspend the liquor license of a business or shut it down if it was not complying with reopening guidelines. He also said he would sign another order that gave bars the responsibility to limit the number of people gathered outside their establishments.
New York City was the last region of the state to begin the reopening process, on June 8. Its suburbs entered Phase 2 this week, and the rest of the state has already moved on to Phase 3, which allows indoor dining at restaurants and personal-care services.
The very factors that made the city an epicenter of the pandemic — its density, tourism and dependence on mass transit — complicated efforts to return to a state of normalcy.
Among major concerns was the city’s public transportation system, which relies on heavily packed, enclosed spaces to ferry millions of people across New York. The next phase of the reopening was expected to send more riders back onto public transit, especially the subway, where ridership plunged by more than 90% as the pandemic hit.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway, buses and two commuter rails, said this month that it expects just over 2 million daily riders will use public transportation in Phase 2.
In anticipation, transit officials are urging riders returning to the system to wear face masks, use hand sanitizer, avoid rush hour and seek out less crowded train cars where possible. Subway workers have been cleaning the system nightly and have taken steps to encourage social distancing in stations and on trains.

NEW YORK — Three sisters from three different boroughs shared the same bench on the Coney Island boardwalk and toasted with cups of beer — together again at last. Teenagers with baseball gloves and a bat sneaked through a hole in a fence at a closed-off diamond. A manager at a Brooklyn clothing store insisted to a reporter that no, they’re not open, since that’s not allowed, even as customers browsed inside.
Officially, New York City is still in Phase 1 of the long reopening process, a land of curbside pickups and closed playgrounds and takeout cocktails that aren’t supposed to be consumed in public. On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would enter the second phase next Monday.
But anyone stepping outside or taking a glance at social media has noticed a population already so far along on the journey to normalcy that they could be living in a different place.
New Yorkers who once ducked for cover at the sound of a cough a block away are stretching both their comfort levels and the rules, venturing out to lay claim to the parts of their lives they haven’t known since March. And they are met by bars and businesses starved for income and doing their own feats of stretching — of their necks, as they look the other way as customers gather at uncomfortably close quarters.
New York, the early epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States, is being observed as a barometer of recovery around the country, its slow-and-steady approach helping bring the number of daily deaths to just 19 on Tuesday from a high of 799 on April 8. But new surges of the virus in states like Florida, Arizona and Texas that reopened more quickly suggest the perils of letting down the collective guard.
In that way, too, New York City has become a barometer, of a nation of pent-up souls eager for a change no matter what their governors or mayors think.
It is as if the city is rebuilding itself, not with scaffolding and steel, but with cheeseburgers eaten at outside tables and fathers hoisting toddlers over the locked gates of closed playgrounds. It is a city built on festive, furtive and sometimes troubling pushing of boundaries. A lot more social, a lot less distancing.
“We made it! That’s what I say,” said Alba Cuba, 66, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, mask on hand but not on her face, at Coney Island last Friday with two of her sisters, Magnolia Garcia, 74, and Maria Velez, 86. They live spread out in Staten Island, Queens and Brooklyn, and so had followed the guidelines and quarantined separately in their own homes, until recently.
Down the beach from the sisters, a Parks Department officer with a bullhorn on his truck ordered swimmers out of the water. Elsewhere, friends gathered at what has become the new watering hole, the sidewalks and streets outside bar takeout windows, and sometimes at outdoor tables that are supposed to be off-limits to dining until Phase 2.
At the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, tables and chairs have been placed outside on the sidewalk, for the patrons to have a place to sit while they wait for their takeout orders. The fact that many of them eat their meals at those tables is not the tavern’s responsibility, said its owner, Eytan Sugarman, 46.
“I’m not a bouncer, I’m not a police officer, I don’t have the right to tell them what to do when they take their stuff and go,” he said. (Perhaps customers are making assumptions based on the bar’s Instagram post: “Our Patio is ... OPEN!!!!!!!”)
Sugarman said he had bigger worries: “Survival,” he said. “I think the industry is facing destruction.” His is among the oldest bars in the city, “and it could close,” he said.
A clothing store simply marked 1/2 Price Outlet displayed racks of apparel on the sidewalk out front — but also within the shop itself, its doors open as if beyond Phase 1. As customers went in and out, a manager insisted to a reporter it wasn’t what it seemed — “Not open, just cleaning” — and shooed away two women looking at shirts.
Since the start of the lockdowns in March, the city has handed out 11,000 warnings and close to 2,000 summonses, according to Joseph Fucito, the New York City sheriff, who helps oversee enforcement. Even so, the rule-bending and breaking have become a brazenly open secret.
At playgrounds, children are playing on swings behind locked gates as their parents look on. One playground in Williamsburg was unlocked with a bolt cutter, and as of Thursday, the gate remained wide open. Baseball players sneaking through a hole in the fence at another park in Brooklyn did so a block away from a precinct station house.
“There’s been a lot going on the last few weeks and we’ve had to put resources into a lot more things,” the mayor said Wednesday, alluding to the protests, still ongoing, that have followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He said that the city did not relish issuing fines to small businesses, “especially after everything they’ve been through, but if we have to, we will.”
He also said he understood why people were setting caution aside. “It’s been so long, they’ve been through so much,” de Blasio said. “But there’s a reason we’ve structured the rules, there a reason the state has structured the rules the way we have, and that’s to fight back the disease and keep it out of our lives.”
Among those gathering with others, there is a new logic at play, one that suggests that friends and family from different households who have been following the rules are no longer off limits. This leap of faith is the passport to places like Williamsburg, where unmasked friends have gathered under the sun at Domino and McCarren Parks and outside the bars on Berry Street, which has been closed to car traffic.
“They’re people we know,” explained Chris Burnett, 35, as he and his friends sipped beer and tequila on Berry Street on a recent afternoon. “I believe that my friends wouldn’t show up sick.”
His partner, Heather Sumner, 32, repeated a phrase commonly heard these days, the password for entry to these speakeasies in plain sight:
“We can’t stay inside forever.”
It’s a phrase that Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, hears often from friends who ask if it’s safe to meet up outside, or to invite others for a meal.
“A lot of this is about trying to manage risks that we can’t really quantify,” she said. “The odds of you being exposed to someone with coronavirus has certainly gone down in New York. At the same time, coronavirus has not been eradicated from New York. There still is community transmission occurring.”
That uncertainty weighs heavily on some. Sally Sargood, 48, who was sitting on the grass in Manhattan’s Bryant Park last weekend, explained the boundaries of her own comfort zone. “I have my bubble of five friends that I see,” she said, while sitting with one. “And anything outside of that bubble, I don’t feel comfortable.”
A new part of daily life has played into the decisions of many: the citywide protests over racism and police brutality, which continue to draw crowds from the hundreds to the thousands. From within, many participants have said they were pleasantly surprised by the efforts at social distancing and mask wearing that they saw.
Alejandra Pedraca, a 29-year-old living in Crown Heights, marched with the Brooklyn Liberation protest past Fort Greene Park on Sunday, where, she said, the end justified the risk.
“If it’s what the protests are about — police violence and people dying — then of course it’s worth it,” she said. “There’s no comparison between probably getting COVID and keeping systematic racism.”
Others, viewing the protests from the outside, saw in them a sort of hall pass for going out, with a large number of people — and police officers, many refusing to wear masks — behaving as if the coronavirus has moved on.
“It’s a double standard,” said Sasha Rosado, 40, a pediatric therapist in Greenpoint enjoying calamari outside with friends. “We’ve been told to social distance and stay home and, wow, I see these people gathering. It was confusing and irritating.”
Rasmussen, the virologist at Columbia, who has quarantined in Seattle since March, has heard all the arguments, all the rationalizing from her friends. She said she is not convinced, not yet.
“I’m still not really getting together with people,” she said Tuesday. “Just staying with my family.”

Here Are the Differences Between the Senate and House Police Reform Bills [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — Facing a groundswell of public support for addressing systemic racism and excessive use of force in law enforcement, Democrats and Republicans have unveiled competing proposals to tackle the issues.
The two bills, one crafted by Senate Republicans and the other by Democrats, differ in ways large and small. Both chambers plan to consider their respective legislation next week, but to reach a bipartisan agreement, they will ultimately have to reconcile two vastly different proposals.
Here are some of the main points of contrast that are likely to emerge as sticking points.
______
Democrats want to do away with chokeholds and similar maneuvers, while Republicans are encouraging narrower restrictions.
THE HOUSE BILL
TITLE 3, Sec. 363, p. 67: (2) CHOKEHOLDS AS CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS . Section 242 of Title 18, United States Code, as amended by Section 101, is amended by adding at the end the following: “For the purposes of this section, the application of any pressure to the throat or windpipe, use of maneuvers that restrict blood or oxygen flow to the brain, or carotid artery restraints which prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air is a punishment, pain or penalty.”
THE SENATE BILL
TITLE 1, Sec. 105, p. 24: (1) DEFINITION. — The term “chokehold” means a physical maneuver that restricts an individual’s ability to breathe for the purposes of incapacitation . (2) FEDERAL POLICY. — The attorney general shall develop a policy for federal law enforcement agencies that bans the use of chokeholds except when deadly force is authorized.
The House bill would ban chokeholds and any neck-pressure maneuver that results in restricting an airway, classifying them as civil rights violations. It would also pressure state and local police departments to impose their own bans on such tactics, withholding critical federal grant money if they do not do so. The Senate measure also conditions federal grants on banning chokeholds, but defines the practice much more narrowly, applying it only to something done with the goal of incapacitating someone. It calls on the attorney general to develop new restrictions on chokeholds.
—
Democrats would alter qualified immunity to allow victims of police brutality to seek damages; Republicans would not.
THE HOUSE BILL
Title 1, Sec. 102, p. 6. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY REFORM. Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United 16 States (42 U.S.C. 1983) is amended by adding at the end the following: “ It shall not be a defense or immunity to any action brought under this section against a local law enforcement officer (as defined in Section 2 of the Justice 20 in Policing Act of 2020) or a state correctional officer (as defined in Section 1121(b) of Title 18, United States 22 Code) that — ‘(1) the defendant was acting in good faith, or that the defendant believed, reasonably or otherwise, that his or her conduct was lawful at the time when the conduct was committed; or ‘(2) the rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws were not clearly established at the time of their deprivation by the defendant, or that at this time, the state of the law was otherwise such that the defendant could not reasonably have been expected to know whether his or her conduct was lawful.’”
FROM SEN. TIM SCOTT, R-S.C., SPONSOR OF THE SENATE BILL
My position has been that when the Democrats start talking about qualified immunity and the ability to aggressively pursue the officers at a higher threshold, that is a poison pill from my perspective. Is there a conversation that could be had around something different? Perhaps.
The House bill would fundamentally alter the doctrine of qualified immunity, which offers legal protections to police officers for their actions in situations where citizens are seeking damages for violations of their constitutional rights.
The Senate legislation in its current form does not address the practice, though some Republicans indicated that they may be open to discussions around the issue. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters on Tuesday that he would be introducing separate legislation that would change how qualified immunity was applied.
______
Democrats would make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct. Republicans would call for de-escalation training for officers.
THE HOUSE BILL
TITLE 1, SEC. 101, p. 6: Section 242 of Title 18, United States Code, is amended — (1) by striking “willfully” and inserting “knowingly or with reckless disregard” ; and (2) by adding at the end the following: “For purposes of this section, an act shall be considered to be death resulting if the act was a substantial factor contributing to the death of the person.”
THE SENATE BILL
TITLE 6, Sec. 601, p. 58: The attorney general, in consultation with relevant law enforcement agencies of states and units of local government, labor organizations, professional law enforcement organizations and mental health organizations, shall develop training curricula in — (A) alternatives to use of force and de-escalation tactics; and (B) safely responding to a person experiencing a behavioral health crisis, including techniques and strategies that are designed to protect the safety of the person experiencing the behavioral health crisis, law enforcement officers and the public.
The Democratic bill would lower the bar for the prosecution of police officers for misconduct. While prosecutors currently need to prove that an officer “willfully” violated an individual’s constitutional rights, the Democratic legislation would lower that standard to actions taken “knowingly or with reckless disregard” for a person’s rights.
The bill unveiled by Senate Republicans would leave the prosecutorial standard intact. Instead, it seeks to address excessive use of force by requiring local law enforcement agencies to report the use of practices like no-knock warrants and incentivize them to provide their officers with de-escalation and bystander training.

Senate GOP Unveils Narrow Policing Bill, Setting Up Clash With Democrats [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress moved forward Wednesday with vastly different proposals for addressing systemic racism in law enforcement, setting up an election-year clash amid growing public support for changing policing in the United States.
Senate Republicans unveiled a narrow set of changes that would encourage state and local police departments to carry out reforms, including by restricting the use of chokeholds and penalizing departments that do not require the use of body cameras. Republicans also proposed creating new de-escalation training for officers and better systems for tracking misconduct.
Introduced by Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sole black Republican in the chamber, their bill would not mandate any anti-bias measures, instead proposing the creation of a museum curriculum to educate law enforcement personnel about the history of racism and improving race relations between the police and the communities they serve.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, announced the Senate would take up the bill, called the Justice Act, next week. It was a swift timeline that reflected a sense of urgency to act.
“The witnessing of the murder of George Floyd, and the experience in my hometown of Breonna Taylor, certainly brings to the forefront this issue for all Americans, including Senate Republicans,” McConnell said. “I want you to know that we’re serious about making a law here.”
But Democrats dismissed the measure as meaningless. Across the Capitol in the House, they were pressing forward with a more far-reaching overhaul that would revamp how police officers operate and make it easier to hold them legally accountable for misconduct, putting in place new anti-discrimination measures and strict limits on the excessive use of force, which Republicans have already rejected.
The full House is set to vote next week on its measure, which the Judiciary Committee approved on Wednesday in a 24-14 vote along party lines. The actions on both sides of Capitol Hill demonstrated the wide gulf that lawmakers would have to bridge to reach an agreement just months before Election Day on what both sides agree is an exceedingly complicated and sensitive set of issues.
Emphasizing the stakes and the fraught nature of the topic, Republicans and Democrats sparred openly Wednesday even before either measure had reached the floor.
Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, who is white, implored his colleagues not to waste “this singular opportunity” with “a token, halfhearted approach.” Scott, who vented his anger last week at being called a “token” in his party on issues of race, took to the floor angrily to respond.
His voice quavering, he noted that Durbin’s comment came on the fifth anniversary of the massacre by a white supremacist of nine black parishioners praying at Mother Emanuel AME in his hometown, Charleston. Dubin’s remark “hurts the soul,” Scott said.
Scott warned that if the two sides resorted to political point-scoring, nothing would get done. “More people in communities of color will have less confidence in the institutions of power and authority in this nation because we missed the moment,” he said.
Emily Hampsten, a spokeswoman for Durbin, said the senator had immediately offered a private apology to Scott after the Republican’s floor speech. The comment had been aimed at McConnell, who Durbin feared would squelch real debate on the measure and deprive Democrats of the chance to make changes, Hampsten said.
Not long after, a tense argument broke out in the House Judiciary Committee as Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., who is black, told Republicans on the panel, all of whom are white, that they were “making a mockery of the pain that exists in my community” by trying to add measures unrelated to racism in policing to the bill.
That prompted an irate retort from Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who demanded whether Richmond was assuming that none of the Republicans on the panel had nonwhite children.
Gaetz later said in an interview that he had raised a nonwhite child as his own for the last six years.
Vitriol aside, lawmakers in both parties were facing difficult choices about how to move forward.
Democratic senators must decide whether to allow the Republican bill to advance and risk giving Republicans political cover on an issue that has placed them on the defensive. Or Democrats can reject the measure and hold out for more robust reforms, opening themselves to criticism for blocking action.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said he had not decided how to proceed. But he said Scott’s bill would “not stop us from living this nightmarish cycle,” urging Republicans to take more assertive steps. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, indicated that Democrats would try to negotiate for more in the Senate but did not rule out using Senate rules to block Republicans’ plan.
McConnell dared Democrats to allow a debate.
“If they want to make a law and not just try to make a point,” he said, “hopefully they’ll join us in getting on the bill and trying to move forward.”
But his comments also underscored the dilemma facing Republicans. While they have tried to show a willingness to meet a moment of national reflection on race — rushing to put together a bill to change policing for the first time in years and speaking in unusually candid terms about racism in the country — they are opposed to the federal mandates and legal changes that civil rights activists say are necessary to confront systemic bias in policing. They are also staring down a grim political terrain five months before an election, with Democrats feeling more confident of their chances and positioned to use the issue to score political points.
Scott’s legislation was ultimately the product of negotiations between Republicans in the Senate, the House, the Justice Department and the White House. House Republicans, who were initially drafting their own proposal, now plan to introduce only Scott’s bill as their own counterpoint. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters Wednesday that the legislation had the administration's full support.
Across the Capitol in the House Judiciary Committee, the discussion was a mirror image during an hourslong debate over the Democrats’ bill, which would ban the use of chokeholds and other neck-pressure tactics, incentivize new officer anti-bias training and require that lethal force be used only as a last resort. It would also eliminate the qualified immunity doctrine, which shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights are found to have been violated.
The outcome was not in doubt: Democrats have the votes to put the panel’s stamp of approval on the package and plan to pass it through the House as early as next week. But the panel’s debate foreshadowed what was to come as the two parties tried to reconcile their proposals.
Republicans, for instance, showed deep unease around qualified immunity, proposing alternative means to narrow protections for officers in certain cases but not eliminate it altogether. They said the change was necessary to protect small departments from expensive, frivolous lawsuits.
Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., said the legislation included “provisions that will have a net negative impact on communities that are most affected by crime and on the safety of officers who put their lives on the line to serve them.”
But Republicans also sought to deflect from the proposal at hand, accusing Democrats of backing efforts to defund police departments, which their bill does not do, and proposing new requirements that the FBI record all interviews, such as the ones they conducted while investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. Republicans also proposed a federal study of whether to declare Antifa a domestic terrorism organization, which prompted Richmond’s outburst.
Scott has made clear that he believes eliminating qualified immunity, a proposal rejected by the White House, would amount to a “poison pill,” although a small group of Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, is working with Democrats to introduce a measure in the coming days that would do just that.
Scott’s bill instead incentivizes local police departments through grant programs to carry out de-escalation and bystander training for their officers. It does not place an outright ban on chokeholds, but like the Democrats’ bill, it would condition state and local police departments’ access to federal funds on restricting that practice. But the Republican plan contains a much narrower definition, which applies only to an action meant to incapacitate a person. Democrats would ban any maneuver by the police that hindered breathing or blocked an airway.
Scott acknowledged his bill’s limitations but argued that it amounted to a significant step forward, referencing conversations he has had in recent days with the families of black Americans who were recently killed by the police. Both bills would also designate lynching a federal hate crime for the first time.
“Does it take it to the level that every family member wants it to? I think the answer is probably not,” Scott said. “Does it get us much closer? According to the words I heard from family members in both meetings, the answer is yes.”

NEW YORK — One protester said a police officer used a baton to pin him by his neck against a squad car. Another said she was tackled by an officer who then drove his knee into her back so hard she could not breathe.
A third — a registered nurse — was tending to a young man with a head wound but claimed police would not allow an ambulance to drive through a crowd to fetch him. A fourth described rushing through a line of police with batons to help a sobbing teenage girl, then escaping with her just before an officer tried to grab them.
“It felt,” she said, “like warfare.”
These and other troubling accounts emerged Wednesday at the first public hearing held by state officials investigating the New York Police Department’s handling of protests stemming from the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis last month.
The inquiry is being led by the state attorney general, Letitia James, and comes as city officials and some district attorneys in New York are also examining how police have dealt with what is now more than three straight weeks of demonstrations.
At the beginning of the hearing, James said that she and her investigators had already received hundreds of tips about possible police misconduct at the protests and had lined up so many witnesses that testimony would last all day Wednesday and would continue Thursday morning.
For several hours, she questioned more than a dozen witnesses with her two partners in the probe: Loretta Lynch, a former U.S. attorney general, and Barry Friedman, a law professor and expert on policing at New York University.
Much of the testimony — streamed on the internet because of the coronavirus crisis — echoed news reports and videos that have come out in recent weeks detailing incidents in which police shoved seemingly peaceful protesters to the ground or used pepper spray and batons on them. Witnesses also described police encircling them before charging in with batons, a controversial maneuver known as kettling.
The hearing marked the first time that individual demonstrators told their stories to the public, and some became emotional, erupting into tears or fits of rage.
Police officials have promised to hold accountable any officers who have violated the law, and so far one officer — Vincent D’Andraia — is facing criminal charges in Brooklyn. At least two others have been suspended, and dozens are under investigation over attacks on protesters.
During the first few days of the protests, before a curfew was imposed June 1 because of looting, violence was also directed at officers. At least 300 officers were injured as demonstrators pelted them with rocks, water bottles and on occasion Molotov cocktails, police said. One officer was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. Dozens of police vehicles were damaged and at least 13 were burned.
Earlier this month, the police commissioner, Dermot Shea, apologized for instances of misconduct but said the majority of officers had shown restraint and acted appropriately. He also appealed to demonstrators to stop insulting and attacking his officers, warning that anti-police rhetoric could lead to further violence.
“For there to be calm, there must also be contrition,” he said. “So I am sorry.” He then paused and asked, “Are you?”
Alan Williams, one of the first witnesses to testify, said that he was at the Barclays Center on May 29, when, for no reason he could discern, officers began shooting pepper spray at the crowd in “a panoramic fashion,” stinging his eyes. After falling to his knees and flushing his eyes with milk, Williams said he got to his feet as officers swinging batons converged on the crowd.
Williams, who was arrested that night, was released in time to ride his bicycle to another protest two days later that ended near Bryant Park in Manhattan. As evening fell, he said, police ordered the crowd to disperse, but officers advanced before anyone was able to move away.
In the ensuing melee, Williams said he fell to the ground atop his bicycle and was arrested a second time. One officer, he said, threw his bike and damaged it. “The cops those first few nights were pretty aggressive,” he said.
Kali Gerber, the nurse, took part in a protest march in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, that same week, winding up outside the 88th Precinct station house in Clinton Hill. There, she said, she and about 200 other demonstrators faced off with a line of officers in riot gear.
Gerber said that after some teenagers jumped on a police van, police told the crowd to leave. Before anyone could do so, however, police mounted a charge with shields, batons, pepper spray and flash-bang explosives, she said.
One officer shoved Gerber with his shield, she said, and she lost one of her shoes and cut her leg on the chain of her bicycle. A man was thrown into an iron fence, she said, and a woman near her was slammed into the door of a police car. Hours later, federal authorities arrested two people and charged them with damaging a police vehicle at the station house with a Molotov cocktail.
Gerber found herself caring for a “traumatized” young man who had a head injury. But police, she said, would not permit an ambulance to pass through the crowd to pick him up. The ambulance, she said, had to take another route, and it finally reached the man 20 minutes later.
On June 4, Ryan Fiedler attended a protest that began in McCarren Park in Brooklyn and ended on a side street in Williamsburg, he testified. There, without warning, Fiedler said, police charged his group as the curfew neared and began to make arrests while people fled.
Fiedler said that as he ran, he saw four or five officers beating a bicyclist. When called out to stop them, one of the officers charged him with a baton. The officer, he claimed, pushed him back against a squad car and held him in place with the baton choking his neck.
“It was humbling to realize that this was the response to protests about the police use of force and the whole world was watching,” Fiedler said.
Dounya Zayer, 20, described how D’Andraia, who now faces charges of assault, shoved her so violently at a protest near the Barclays Center on May 29 that she fell back against the pavement, cracking her head and suffering a seizure. What shocked her even more, Zayer said, was that dozens of officers walked by and failed to help her, a scene captured by a reporter’s video.
James said that such behavior did not reflect the “vast majority” of New York City officers, but Zayer, growing angry, disagreed.
“I understand there are good cops, but where was the good cop to help me?” she asked. “Where were the good cops to help George Floyd? Where are the good cops I keep hearing of?”

Trump and de Blasio: ‘Together, at the Wrong Time in History’ [With graphic(s)]

During the social unrest and racial awakening of the 1960s and ’70s, the mayor of New York, John Lindsay, coined a memorable phrase about his chosen occupation: “the second toughest job in America.” This wasn’t self-indulgence on Lindsay’s part; the complexities of leading New York have sometimes rivaled the challenges of the presidency.
It would follow, then, that during this moment when New York is so central to the crises afflicting the country — as the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and convulsing with protests related to its long, troubled history of racism in policing — that the president, a New Yorker himself, and the mayor would rise as their predecessors did to lead the country in times of shared despair.
Instead, President Donald Trump and Mayor Bill de Blasio are both diminished as leaders, polarizing and lacking the trust of the people they serve. Far from alleviating tensions, they have each sparked an outpouring of anger from demonstrators in the streets. Rather than using the crisis as an opportunity to speak to people outside their base of political support, they have alienated even their own supporters.
And as leaders at the state and local level all across the country have tried to meet the demands of the moment with bold policy proposals and inspiring messages, observers who have closely followed the careers of both Trump and de Blasio said the men seemed like bystanders to the historic events unfolding around them.
“Both of them together, at the wrong time in history, have provided very little leadership,” said George Arzt, a longtime Democratic consultant and former City Hall aide under Mayor Edward Koch.
On a national level, that leadership vacuum has been filled by governors — most prominently by a third New Yorker, Gov. Andrew Cuomo — and a few standout mayors. Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, for instance, has won praise for speaking movingly about her anxieties over law enforcement as a black mother. And Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., who has challenged Trump for using the military to quell demonstrations in the capital, had a major thoroughfare near the White House repainted with the slogan “Black Lives Matter” — a show of defiance that de Blasio said he would copy.
“I can’t remember,” Arzt added, “when the leading mayor in the country was not from New York City.”
Although the mayor and the president are politically polar opposites — Trump a latecomer to the arch-conservatism his administration has pursued and de Blasio a longtime progressive advocate — they have similar flaws and challenges as leaders.
Neither man has been particularly willing or eager to reflect on their downplaying of the coronavirus early on. Trump has said he wouldn’t change anything about his administration’s response. De Blasio has defended actions that critics said made him look indifferent and self-involved, like when he traveled with his security detail from Gracie Mansion in Manhattan to his gym in Brooklyn for one last workout a few hours before businesses across the city would shutter for months because his own administration had determined it was no longer safe for them to operate.
Kevin Sheekey, a senior aide to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the lack of leadership from Washington was putting an even greater burden on local governments and their leaders. “We have these back-to-back crises,” he said, “and they require national responses. But we don’t have an individual in D.C. who can make the best of what he has been given and bring people together, and that’s an enormous problem for us.”
Regarding the national platform Cuomo has attained with daily briefings, Sheekey said, “Normally that kind of role is not filled by Albany.”
Both Trump and de Blasio have suffered from failing to reach beyond their narrow bases of support, analysts said. Had they broadened their appeal, voters might have more trust in them, said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic consultant and longtime observer of New York politics.
“The irony is that de Blasio, who considered himself the leading progressive, and Trump, who considered himself Mr. Conservative, the leader of a movement, are mirror images of each other,” Gyory said. “And by never trying to expand their base, they have belittled themselves in the wake of this crisis.”
But now even parts of their bases are unhappy. Trump has been losing support among white evangelicals, the foundation of his political coalition.
And in an affront to de Blasio, some African Americans have literally turned their backs on him. At a recent demonstration in Brooklyn honoring George Floyd, the black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked nationwide protests, the mayor was heckled and jeered as some in the crowd turned away from him. It was a display of disgust that has been directed at him before — but from police officers who complained that the mayor did not respect them, not progressive New Yorkers who helped put him in office.
In other times of national crisis, the president and the mayor of New York have worked in tandem to create a sense that the fate of the nation and its largest city were closely intertwined. Before the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a New Yorker, put Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in charge of the national Office of Civilian Defense, which helped state and local governments prepare for looming conflict.
The Sept. 11 attacks made Rudy Giuliani “America’s Mayor” — for a time, at least — after his steady and stoic response, first glimpsed by the nation when he emerged from an emergency command center two blocks from the World Trade Center and urged the city to remain calm, his clothes dusted in ash from the fallen south tower.
Giuliani and President George W. Bush displayed a unified front and became the faces of the recovery, working together to triage the country’s frayed nerves.
The country saw them together when Bush appeared at ground zero Sept. 14, Giuliani at his side, and shouted into a bullhorn to the emergency responders digging through the rubble. “I can hear you! I can hear you!” Bush said. “And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.” Bush’s leadership immediately after the attacks pushed his approval ratings to 90%. They remained above 70% for another 10 months.
Whatever you thought of their politics as Republicans, historians said, there was a general sense that Bush and Giuliani were leading with confidence and steadiness.
“Bush — whether you liked or didn’t like what he did — didn’t lose interest as our current president seems to have done with COVID,” said John Murphy, a scholar of the U.S. presidency at the University of Illinois.
And with Giuliani, he added, the country saw someone who “bluntly faced the crisis by telling the truth: ‘This is going to be hard; it’s going to take a long time to get out of this, but we’re going to keep working at it.’ ” By contrast, Murphy said, “Mayor de Blasio has been absent to us in the rest of the country.”
Bush and Trump both had to confront the major crises of their administrations with similarly shaky political standings. But Bush, who also lost the popular vote in his first election, intentionally sought a unifying approach as he led the country in the weeks after the attacks.
Peter Wehner, a speechwriter for Bush, recalled how the president understood that he could be more effective if Americans believed their political leadership wasn’t divided.
“After 9/11 this was true across the board. It wasn’t just Giuliani and Bush being in sync. It was Bush and Democrats being in sync that was important,” Wehner said. And as White House aides debated where Bush should give his speech Sept. 20, the president ultimately settled on delivering it before the bipartisan audience of a joint session of Congress.
“It was essential that the country see Democrats and Republicans and the national political leadership come together,” Wehner said.
Trump’s public utterances and appearances have been light on appeals to unity and healing. He has yet to visit New York City — where he was born and lived nearly all of his life before switching his residency to Florida last year — since the pandemic hit, claiming the lives of more than 30,000 people so far, the highest by far of anywhere in the country. He blamed the Secret Service for not allowing him to go. He has not held anything like a memorial service to honor the more than 116,000 people in the United States who have died from the virus.
Trump hasn’t revealed himself to be any different from the person he was when he first campaigned for president four years ago: impulsive, go-it-alone and lacking any capacity for self-doubt and self-reflection. De Blasio, however, has revealed himself to be something quite different from the transformational progressive who campaigned promising to address income inequality and racial disparities in policing.
His leadership has been criticized as passive, reactive and inconsistent. He resisted pressure to shut down public gathering places as the number of infections in the city rose in March. Then, one day after encouraging New Yorkers to grab a bite and a drink at the establishments they loved, he ordered them all closed. He wrongly claimed in April that scientists had just learned that asymptomatic carriers could spread the virus, when in fact it had been known for weeks. Despite feeling sick this week and participating in demonstrations over the weekend that exposed him to thousands of people, the mayor’s office said he would not be tested for the coronavirus, going against the city’s own guidelines.
When the city erupted after Floyd’s death, looters and vandals broke into stores, set fires and damaged property for two nights before the mayor declared a citywide curfew, prompting a dressing down from Cuomo, who said de Blasio and the New York Police Department “did not do their job.” But then de Blasio found himself undercut again. Police so aggressively enforced the curfew on peaceful protesters that the mayor was accused of enabling the very kind of police behavior he once promised to stop.
“It’s a very, very tough job,” Arzt said of being mayor. “But the guy who is out there fighting for leftist causes has disappeared.”

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings Gives $120 Million to Historically Black Colleges [With graphic(s)]

Reed Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix, and his wife, Patty Quillin, donated $120 million to the United Negro College Fund, Spelman College and Morehouse College, the largest-ever individual gift to support scholarships at historically black colleges and universities.
The record donation comes amid protests following the police killing of George Floyd and the national conversation about how to end systemic racism. That conversation has included discussions about how to provide more education and job opportunities for African Americans.
Unlike the Ivy League universities that have endowments in the tens of billions of dollars — Harvard University’s endowment tops $40 billion — the top historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, have endowments that are hundreds of millions of dollars. Spelman’s, for example, is around $390 million.
Hastings said he and Quillin wanted to help change that.
They have made education a primary focus of their philanthropy and have given smaller amounts in the past several years to the same institutions. “I think white people in our nation need to accept that it’s a collective responsibility,” Hastings said. Floyd’s killing and the emotional outpouring that followed were “the straw that broke the camel’s back, I think, for the size of the donation,” he added.
Hastings said he hoped that the donation would lead other wealthy individuals to give to HBCUs. “Generally, white capital flows to predominantly white institutions, perpetuating capital isolation,” he and Quillin said in a statement announcing the donation Wednesday. Hastings is worth $5.3 billion, according to Bloomberg.
Indeed, many of the largest donations in education have been made by alumni to their alma maters. Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, gave $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University in 2018; his collective gifts to that school top $3 billion.
Last year, billionaire financier Robert F. Smith donated $34 million to pay off the debts of Morehouse’s graduating class, one of the biggest individual HBCU donations at the time.
David A. Thomas, president of Morehouse, said that raising money at the scale usually given to the top, historically white schools had been near impossible. “The reality is that our alumni have done quite well. But I don’t think we have any billionaires,” he said.
Before he arrived at Morehouse, Thomas taught at Harvard Business School and was the dean at Georgetown University’s business school. “There you had much more wealth within the alumni base, so you don’t have to go out as much,” he said. “And it’s easy to raise money from people who aren’t in the alumni base because your alumni can take you to them. Here, it’s really about developing and cultivating relationships, oftentimes with people who don’t know what an HBCU — what that even means.”
The need for funds is particularly acute given the economic challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic is creating both for students and schools, said Michael L. Lomax, chief executive of the United Negro College Fund, who introduced Hastings and Quillin to Spelman and Morehouse. He is hoping to raise $1 billion to address the effects.
“That’s the scale of the need,” Lomax said. “So we’re at about $60 million today. Forty million of that is from Patti and Reed. We need not 10 times that amount. We need almost 20 times that amount.”
Hastings and Quillin have been active in education philanthropy and reform for many years. Hastings has promoted charter schools and briefly sat on the board of education in California. He is on the board of Pahara Institute, a nonprofit that helps train teachers and supports the education reform movement. Recode reported Tuesday that Hastings is building a retreat in Colorado for teacher training. He and Quillin have signed the Giving Pledge, promising to give away the majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes.
Hastings has also sought to diversify Netflix’s workforce. Netflix reported that 7% of its employees in the United States are African American, as are 8% of its company leaders, which is among the highest in the technology industry (but still only about half the share of African Americans in the overall population). Netflix was an early supporter of high-profile black directors like Ava DuVernay. Yet the company has also been accused of promoting content by race, which it disputes as impossible because, it says, it doesn’t collect information about the ethnicity of its customers.
The large donation to the HBCUs, which will receive $40 million each, came as a surprise to their leaders.
“When they first talked to us, they said to us they were making a $20 million gift, and we thought that was unbelievable,” said Mary Schmidt Campbell, Spelman’s president. “I mean, truly I was speechless. I actually cried.”
The next day, she received an email from Quillin: “They were upping it to $40 million.”

The Boy Scouts of America said this week that the organization would create a “diversity and inclusion” merit badge and make earning it a requirement of becoming an Eagle Scout, the highest scouting rank. The nonprofit also joined a growing number of organizations announcing public support for racial equality and the Black Lives Matter movement.
The Texas-based organization, which was formed in 1910 and reports more than 2.2 million youth members, has frequently been criticized for a lack of inclusivity.
For decades, openly gay people were not allowed to be members or adult leaders, a stance that began to change only in 2013. Almost three-quarters of its youth membership is white, with black members making up less than 7%, according to a tally from the end of 2018.
In a statement Monday from the executive committee, the Boy Scouts said the group would do more to make sure “every person feels that they belong, are respected, and are valued in Scouting.”
The organization said that it would make diversity and inclusion training mandatory for its staff, starting July 1, and that it would work with local councils to ensure that property names, events and other insignia do not bear “symbols of oppression.” The Boy Scouts said the review would “build on” an existing 30-year ban on displays of the Confederate flag.
Effie Delimarkos, a spokeswoman for the Boy Scouts, said the organization was still working on the details of how a scout would earn the diversity and inclusion merit badge. The development of a new badge typically takes years, but she said the timeline would be expedited in this case.
The organization said in the statement that it would incorporate elements from existing badges that “require scouts to learn about and engage with other groups and cultures to increase understanding and spur positive action.”
“We believe that Black Lives Matter,” the organization’s statement declared, saying the group stood with black families and individuals. “This is not a political issue; it is a human rights issue and one we all have a duty to address.”
The Boy Scouts had initially put out a much broader statement June 3, with no mention of race, and focusing instead on teaching scouts “to become the best versions of themselves.”
“I was shocked and deeply disappointed that their original statement made no reference to the experiences of black people, the pain that the black community was feeling,” said Dwayne Fontenette Jr., 29, an Eagle Scout who also has volunteered as a scout leader.
Fontenette then helped write a letter last week, signed by more than 500 scouts, calling for the Boy Scouts to take a stronger stance against “anti-black racism.” He said in an interview that he was “moved” by the organization’s statement this week.
“It represented for me the first time in my scouting history where I feel like the organization saw me and valued me completely,” he said.
Fontenette, who is black, said the Boy Scouts still had an “extraordinary amount of work to do to create an environment in which black people have equal access and equal outcomes in scouting, and an experience in which we are made to feel as we belong.”
Since the death of George Floyd during an arrest by the Minneapolis Police prompted protests nationwide over racial equality, many organizations and businesses have been eager to publicly embrace the cause. Apple pledged $100 million toward a racial justice initiative. Sephora said it would devote at least 15% of its shelf space to products made by black-owned firms, and companies like Nike, Twitter and Citigroup have all aligned themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement.
The Boy Scouts’ statement came as membership in the organization has dwindled in recent years. While more than 130 million Americans have participated in the Boy Scouts since its inception, shifting American attitudes have pulled families away from the God-and-country oaths and outdoorsy survival skills associated with the Scouts.
The organization has made a number of progressive changes in recent years.
In 2013, the group ended its ban on openly gay youths participating in its activities. Two years later, the Boy Scouts ended a ban on openly gay adult leaders. In January 2017, it said it would begin accepting members based on the gender listed on their applications, paving the way for transgender youth to join the organization.
And while girls had been allowed in some programs, like Sea Scouts, since the early 1970s, the Boy Scouts said in 2017 that the organization would begin allowing girls in its other core programs.
Last year, Scouting Magazine reported that more than 61,000 people became Eagle Scouts.
But the organization has also been embroiled in scandal. In February, the organization filed for bankruptcy after thousands of people came forward with allegations that they were sexually abused by scout leaders, with many filing lawsuits against the Scouts.
Benjamin Jordan, a professor at Christian Brothers University who has researched the history of scouting, said this week’s statement contrasted with the more exclusive reputation the Scouts had developed in recent decades. But he pointed out that the Boy Scouts had, even in the 1920s, sought to encourage the creation of black troops in the Southeast through a program called the “interracial service,” despite conservative pushback.
“This move,” he said, “is more a return to their past rather than a new departure.”

Virginia Sheriff Apologizes for Arrest of Black Pastor Who Called 911 [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
A Virginia sheriff has apologized to a black pastor who was arrested earlier this month after he called 911 to report that a group of white people were trespassing on his property and taunting him with racial slurs.
The pastor, Leon K. McCray, 61, called the authorities during the confrontation, which began when he saw two people hauling a refrigerator to the dumpsters at the apartment building he owns in Edinburg, Virginia, on June 1.
McCray, who declined to comment when reached by phone, told WUSA-TV that the two people became angry when he asked them to leave the property. They quickly returned, he said, with three friends, who were also white. McCray said that the five people surrounded him and began using racial slurs, and that one head-butted him while another shoved him from behind.
In a sermon on June 7, a video recording of which he posted to YouTube, McCray told his congregation at the Lighthouse Church and Marketplace Ministries in Woodstock, Virginia, that one of the people “ran to me full speed snatching his shirt off, jumping in my face, and then he circled around behind me.”
“These same individuals were threatening my life telling me that my black life and the Black Lives Matter stuff, they don’t give a darn about that in this county and they could care less and ‘we will kill you,’” McCray said.
Fearing for his life, McCray told WUSA-TV that he pulled out his gun and “pointed it down to the ground in hopes that they would back off.”
Then he called 911. Deputies from the Shenandoah County Sheriff’s Office arrived and arrested McCray, who was charged with brandishing a firearm, a misdemeanor.
According to Virginia law, it is legal for a person to brandish a weapon in “justifiable self-defense.” McCray later told his congregation that he had a license to carry a concealed weapon.
The Shenandoah County sheriff, Timothy C. Carter, issued a statement late last week in which he said he had spoken with McCray on June 3, two days after the incident, and apologized. He said the five people who confronted McCray had been taken into custody on various charges, including hate crimes.
Carter also said that he had placed two supervisors in his department on administrative leave, and that he had asked the Shenandoah County Attorney’s Office to drop the brandishing charge against McCray.
“After talking with him about the incident, it was apparent to me that the charge of brandishing was certainly not appropriate,” Carter wrote. “Actually, as I told Mr. McCray, if I were faced with similar circumstances, I would have probably done the same thing.”
In an interview on Wednesday, Carter said he had ordered an internal review into the incident. More broadly, he said his department was taking a look at its own conduct and policies in light of the national unrest over police brutality that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
“We’re learning a lot from our involvement in this incident, and we’re trying to learn and be better as we move through this,” he said.
Court documents show that McCray still faces the brandishing charge. On Tuesday, the Shenandoah County Commonwealth attorney, Amanda McDonald Wiseley, filed what is known as a nolle prosequi motion to dismiss the charge. If a judge approves the motion, prosecutors will still have the authority to charge McCray.
McCray’s lawyer, Chris Kowalczuk, said in an interview that he would prefer for the charge to be dismissed “with prejudice,” meaning prosecutors will not have the power to refile it.
“There’s a big difference in discontinuing a prosecution that can be brought back and a dismissal,” Kowalczuk said.
The Shenandoah County Commonwealth Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In his June 7 sermon, McCray reflected on how Floyd’s death in police custody in Minneapolis had “changed something” in the fight against police brutality in the United States and around the world.
“It shifted something in myself and probably many people alike,” he said. “This tragedy of unbelievable death has catapulted this country and the world with a clarion call for change that will not be denied.”

Under Pressure on Policing, New York Mayor Toughens Discipline [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Under immense pressure to overhaul Police Department tactics and curb the department’s authority, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday announced a series of significant changes in the way the nation’s largest police force will discipline its officers.
The changes include the creation of a database next month that will track the roughly 1,100 pending cases involving allegations of police abuse and will include the officers’ names and the charges. The city will also publish all internal trial decisions and eventually make all disciplinary records, past and present, accessible online.
The mayor’s announcement follows weeks of mass demonstrations in New York City, during which the Police Department’s sometimes violent crowd-control tactics have sparked outrage and led critics to question de Blasio’s dedication to overhauling the police. His rhetoric on the issue helped propel him to office in 2013.
In the past two weeks, the mayor has signaled his intention to rethink the Police Department’s budget and role in the city. Earlier this month, de Blasio pledged to cut police funding, although he has balked at the City Council’s proposal to slash $1 billion.
He also is now embracing a City Council bill that would ban law enforcement’s use of chokeholds, after years of resisting the proposal. The bill has enough council support to override a mayoral veto.
“I’m listening. I’m acting,” de Blasio said Wednesday. “I feel what people are saying. Things have to change, they are changing, and they will change more.”
The situation is so fluid that the mayor appeared to modify a new policy that he had just announced the day before. On Tuesday, de Blasio said that he would require police to release all body camera footage and audio within 30 days in cases in which an officer caused death or substantial bodily harm or fired a weapon that could have done so.
Originally he said the policy would not apply retroactively. On Wednesday, he said it would.
He also said Wednesday that the Police Department will speed up disciplinary procedure in cases in which officers cause “substantial injury to a civilian.” The new guidelines require the police commissioner to decide whether to strip the officer of badge and gun or suspend the officer within two days.
Internal investigations in those cases must generally be concluded within two weeks, de Blasio said.
In the past, internal inquiries could take months or years, as occurred in the case of Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Eric Garner into a chokehold.
The mayor’s actions come after the state Legislature’s repeal of the law known as 50-a, which his administration interpreted to shield records of police misconduct.
The mayor made the announcements without the presence of his police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, who will be charged with implementing the new policies. Nevertheless, de Blasio insisted that he and Shea are on the same page.
Police reformers were dubious in their initial response to de Blasio’s announcements, given his history of obstructing change in the department.
In the case of the chokehold bill, senior officials from the mayor’s office had requested that it contain a clause excluding “incidental contact that results in compression of the diaphragm.” Rory I. Lancman, a councilman from Queens and the primary sponsor of the legislation, said the clause would have neutered his bill. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman from the mayor’s office said the mayor embraced Lancman’s bill as is.
On Wednesday, Communities United for Police Reform, an advocacy group, accused the mayor on Twitter of making “empty statements without detail.”
The group has demanded de Blasio defund the police, as has Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, who plays a central role in the city’s budget negotiations. The city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, who, like Johnson, is running for mayor, has also called for some level of defunding.
In a statement, Stringer described de Blasio’s announcement as “unclear” and said the council should pass legislation that requires the Police Department to report disciplinary records in a public online database.
“There is no substitute for codifying this important reform with the force of law,” Stringer said.

Top Democrats Are Trying to Stop This Man From Becoming the Next Ocasio-Cortez [With graphic(s)]

Two years ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, then a young, untested democratic socialist, pulled off a shocking upset by defeating the No. 4 House Democrat, Rep. Joseph Crowley. The primary result was a visceral warning to Democratic leadership that it had better quickly reckon with the push for progressive change, and not underestimate the candidates behind it.
The Democratic establishment has apparently heeded that lesson.
As the June 23 primary nears in New York, another long-tenured Democrat, Eliot L. Engel, is being threatened by a young progressive challenger, Jamaal Bowman. The race has become a focal point for the party’s directional battle, with money and marquee endorsements flying around in recent days.
The latest big-name endorsements came in a span of 16 hours: On Monday afternoon, Hillary Clinton, making her first endorsement of any Democratic incumbent facing a primary in 2020, backed Engel; the following morning, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts endorsed Bowman.
Engel, 73, seems to be the party’s most vulnerable incumbent in the nation at the moment, a potential victim of its emboldened left wing, which has grown impatient with the establishment politics that Engel seems to represent.
Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is a Democratic stalwart, a faithful practitioner of old-school Washington politics, rising in committee ranks and bringing home perks for his diverse and overwhelmingly Democratic district at New York City’s northern border.
Mustachioed and bespectacled, Engel’s most famous trait may be his punctuality: He prides himself on arriving early to each and every State of the Union, to secure a seat to shake the president’s hand — a tradition that he has halted in opposition to President Donald Trump. But in a political landscape upended by the coronavirus and the national reckoning on race and policing, Engel’s press-the-flesh approach is at risk of seeming like an anachronism.
Bowman, 44, has the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ocasio-Cortez, the generational tent poles of progressive Democrats, as well as liberal groups like the Working Families Party and political action committees like the Justice Democrats, which jointly pledged to spend more than $500,000 to oust Engel.
Warren, the former presidential candidate and possible vice-presidential contender, said on Tuesday that Bowman was “exactly the kind of person we need in Congress fighting for big, structural change.”
Engel has widespread support from senior House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi; James E. Clyburn, the House majority whip; and Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic Caucus chairman. On Wednesday, he was endorsed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York.
But Engel has not exactly helped his cause. In early June, at a news conference in the Bronx devoted to Black Lives Matter, he was caught on microphone suggesting that he was only there because of his contested race. “If I didn’t have a primary,” he said, “I wouldn’t care.”
Even party veterans cringed. “This is like hanging a sign from your neck saying, ‘I’ve been in office too long,’ ” tweeted David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist.
Asked about the comment, Engel did not address it directly but said that he had “wanted people to know how I feel because I feel so strongly about what happened” in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis.
“In looking back, I see now that two weeks later that my words have detracted from the protests because they’ve been taken out of context,” he said. “And I want to use my voice to refocus on the fact black lives matter. And they do.”
Both Engel and Bowman have embraced many of the positions championed by Ocasio-Cortez, who represents a neighboring district in the Bronx and Queens, including the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.
Engel’s campaign website also cites support for increased funding of public education, $100 billion in new housing, and comprehensive immigration reform. But his opponents have zeroed in on several hawkish positions he took, including rejecting the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 and supporting the invasion of Iraq more than a decade before.
“You know, I’m pretty progressive myself,” Engel said in an interview last week from his home in the Bronx. “I have a progressive record down the line for many years in Congress and I’m proud of my record.”
Despite the recent successes of some progressive insurgents, it is still extraordinarily difficult to unseat a congressional incumbent in a primary; this year, only two have fallen, each under unusual circumstances.
In Illinois, Rep. Dan Lipinski, a conservative Democrat who had broken with his party on abortion rights and health care, lost to Marie Newman in a rematch in March; in Iowa, Rep. Steve King, a Republican with a history of racist remarks, lost to Randy Feenstra, a state senator.
Bowman is hoping that a different sort of circumstances may catapult him to victory.
The coronavirus outbreak and civil unrest after Floyd’s killing complicated the campaign for both candidates, forcing the cancellation of in-person events and fundraisers. But they also gave Bowman, who is African-American, a conducive environment to stress the need for change in arenas like criminal justice and health care.
Bowman was recruited by Justice Democrats after education activists in New York suggested he could be a potent candidate with a compelling life story: a childhood in public housing in New York City, followed by years as an educator, culminating with the founding of a middle school in the Bronx, the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action, where he was the founding principal.
Bowman began this campaign last June, with several other challengers, including a lawyer, Chris Fink; Sammy Ravelo, a retired police lieutenant; and Andom Ghebreghiorgis, who dropped out earlier this month and endorsed Bowman, solidifying his support among progressives.
“We’ve anchored our race in fighting for racial and economic justice from the very beginning,” Bowman said in an interview. “And what COVID and now these protests are revealing is, to the rest of the country, is how broken our system is.”
The dueling crises also provided Bowman with a powerful talking point accusing Engel of not spending enough time in the district, which includes the northern Bronx and portions of southern Westchester County, a mix of well-to-do neighborhoods like Riverdale and poorer areas.
Bowman has repeatedly attacked Engel’s staying at a home he owns in Maryland during long stretches of the coronavirus virus outbreak, as well as for much of his time in Washington.
“He doesn’t live in our community,” Bowman said in one online testimonial. “I live in our struggles.”
This argument seems to befuddle Engel, who said he bought the Maryland home after he was first elected in 1988 and had two small children at the time.
“I work in Washington and he’s going to deny me a place to sleep?” Engel said, adding, “You can’t stay on the, sleep on the, streets.”
As the race has intensified, Engel has also fought back, pointing out that election records show that Bowman did not vote in 2012, even as Barack Obama — still the lodestar of many Democratic voters — sought a second term. Bowman insists that he remembers voting in Manhattan that year, saying “there must be a problem with the records.”
“Do you think I wouldn’t vote for the first black president?” he said.
Engel also highlighted how Bowman only registered as a Democrat in 2018; he was previously registered in the Independence Party. “So he’s not really a Democrat,” Engel said.
Voters in the district have been inundated with mailers and phone calls on behalf of both candidates, who have already spent a combined $2 million on the race, and will likely spend more in the closing days. As of June 3, Engel still had more than $800,000 in hand, compared with Bowman’s $345,000.
In Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester, Jim Cullen, 57, a self-described moderate Democrat, said he would vote for the incumbent, though he knew his wife and son would vote for Bowman, saying it was good to “preserve the institutional integrity of the Democratic Party at a time when it’s under tremendous pressure.”
But Olivia Lovejoy, 40, said she was ready to embrace Bowman’s message.
“I’m thinking we need change,” said Lovejoy, a customer service representative, adding that Bowman’s candidacy gave her cause for optimism. “I feel hopeful.”
For his part, Engel seemed well aware of the tentative nature of his political perch.
“I never forget for even one moment that this is the people’s seat,” he said. “And not my seat.”

NEW YORK — Edwin Raymond, a black lieutenant in the Police Department, heard racial insults — “Sellout!” and “Uncle Tom!” — rising above protesters’ chants as he helped to control the crowds at recent demonstrations in Brooklyn against police brutality and racism.
He said he understood the words were aimed at black officers like him. He tried not to take them personally, but the shouts were particularly painful, he said, because he has long been an outspoken critic of what he sees as racial discrimination within the department.
“I’m not blind to the issues, but I’m torn,” Raymond said. “As I’m standing there with my riot helmet and being called a ‘coon,’ people have no idea that I identify with them. I understand them. I’m here for them. I’ve been trying to be here as a change agent.”
Raymond, 34, is one of hundreds of black and Hispanic officers in New York City who have found themselves caught between competing loyalties. Many said they sympathized with protesters across the city and the country who have turned out en masse to demonstrate against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of a white officer in Minneapolis.
The officers said they had experienced racism and share the protesters’ mission to combat it. Still, the unrest offers painful reminders that many black and Hispanic New Yorkers see them as enemies in uniform, worsening the internal tug-of-war between their identity and their badges.
Since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014, the Police Department has become “majority-minority”: White officers now make up less than half of the 36,000 uniformed members of the force. The number of Hispanic officers has grown to make up 29% of the force, while the percentage of Asian officers in the force doubled to 9%, according to the department’s data. (In the 2010 census, about 29% of city residents were Hispanic and 14% Asian.)
But the department has struggled to boost the ranks of black officers. Black people make up about 24% of the city but only 15% of the force, a number that has remained flat since 2014. And even though more black and Hispanic chiefs have been elevated to leadership roles under de Blasio, two-thirds of the officers in the department’s top ranks, from lieutenant to chief, are still white, the data show.
In the wake of Floyd’s death on May 25, some black officers felt a duty to speak out. Two days later, Dmaine Freeland, a black detective in Brooklyn, put on his uniform, sat at his kitchen table, clasped his hands and recorded a video on his cellphone.
The detective denounced the officer who had knelt on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while three other officers watched. He called him an “enemy” and asked “every good cop to speak up.” Then he posted the two-minute video on Facebook.
“I just spiritually felt the need to speak for good cops out there,” Freeland, 44, said in an interview, so “that we don’t get bunched in with the actions of one or four bad cops.”
Sgt. Khadijah Faison, a black officer in Jamaica, Queens, took a public step of another kind: She knelt with protesters in a gesture of solidarity.
Faison had been working at a midday protest on May 31 near the 103rd Precinct station, where she is part of the community affairs unit. The demonstrators formed a circle and beckoned her and other officers to join them for prayer. She said she felt moved to do so.
“If you are asking to pray, you kneel. So I kneeled too,” she said. “I think we were all looking for a sign.”
Two other officers also decided to kneel next to her, including her commanding officer, who is white.
The department frowns on officers’ making political statements in uniform, but the Floyd protests have created a different dynamic, as top police officials and union leaders have condemned the officers in Minneapolis.
The police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, shared a NY1 News reporter’s photos of the moment Faison knelt, writing: “We need more of this, to see and hear each other, to work together, to recognize that our differences are our strength.”
The next day, Chief Terence A. Monahan, the department’s highest-ranking uniformed officer, also knelt with protesters in Manhattan, and other officers have followed suit.
Black and Hispanic officers said the show of support from white officers and commanders like Monahan was one of the ways the current protests have been different from past demonstrations over police killings.
Several of the officers said they were disappointed by the looting and violence that has occurred during and after some protest marches, including instances of unnecessary force used by the police against demonstrators.
The violence has made it difficult to have reasonable exchanges with protesters, these officers said. The police have being videotaped shoving, beating and pepper-spraying demonstrators. One officer has been arrested, at least two others have been suspended, and dozens are under investigation over attacks on protesters.
At the same time, the black and Hispanic officers say they feel unnerved by violence aimed at the police. Protesters have hit officers with rocks and bricks and have surrounded occupied police cars, throwing heavy objects at them. Some have even hurled Molotov cocktails.
“You’ve got to worry that someone’s going to hurt you,” Officer Pedro Serrano, who works in the South Bronx, said. “But on the other hand, you understand the fight. You’ve seen the racism.”
But they have also been heartened that the crowds marching after Floyd’s death are bigger and more racially diverse than those that turned out after the death of Eric Garner, a Staten Island father who died after he was put in an illegal chokehold by a New York police officer in 2014.
“You’d think that would be the big one,” Serrano said, referring to the Garner case. “But police departments across the world are showing time and time again that people of color, they don’t matter. So I’m glad to see that more and more people are speaking up and seeing what’s really happening.”
Raymond said the protesters were calling attention to some of the same policing practices that he and 11 other New York officers were seeking to change when they sued the city and the department in 2015 over racial discrimination in enforcement and in promotions. Serrano is also one of the plaintiffs.
The officers said in their lawsuit that the Police Department uses a racist and illegal quota system to target black and Hispanic people for arrests and summonses. Their careers were stalled, the officers claimed, because they objected to the quotas as unfair.
Raymond said the emphasis on numerical targets has led to the overly aggressive policing of black and Hispanic neighborhoods, which in turn has led to more fatal encounters between residents of those areas and the police. “It just becomes an oppressive organization,” he said.
The Police Department has denied the existence of quotas and disputes the accusation that its strategies are racist. The city is fighting the lawsuit.
But similar charges of racism in police departments across the country lie at the heart of the protesters’ complaints.
Serrano said recent measures passed by the state Legislature aimed at addressing some problems raised by Floyd’s death — a statewide ban on police chokeholds and the repeal of a statute that kept officer misconduct secret — were small improvements.
But he said they fail to address the main issue, which, in his view, is the racial biases of the Police Department’s leaders. “If you have a racist leadership who is never held responsible, nothing’s going to happen,” he said. “You’re putting Band-Aids instead of fixing what the problem is.”
Shea has defended his department’s record on race and diversity. He has pointed out that the department in the last six years has moved away from flawed strategies like “stop and frisk,” which a judge found disproportionately affected black and Hispanic residents and ruled unconstitutional. They have also steadily reduced arrests and summonses.
Detective Yuseff Hamm, the former president of the NYPD Guardians Association, a group of about 1,000 black police officers, said the killing of Floyd had eroded the progress that black leaders in the department, like Chief Jeffrey Maddrey in Brooklyn, have made in creating a positive image of policing in black and brown neighborhoods.
“We have to make up ground that we previously had and lost, to get people interested again in becoming police officers,” he said.
Detective Felicia Richards, the current president of the NYPD Guardians, said the visibility of black officers had been important in keeping the peace at the protests. “Kids who look like me need to know they are secured,” she said. “This protest is as much about us as it is about them.”
But sometimes visibility makes officers targets for abuse. During a protest earlier this month outside Trump International Hotel in Columbus Circle, a young black woman saw a black police commander wearing a white shirt and raised her voice to get his attention.
“Hey, you, Uncle Tom! When are you leaving your master’s house!” she shouted over and over again, using an epithet for black people accused of appeasing whites.
The police official glared at the heckler before shifting his gaze, his face a rigid mask showing no emotion.
Protesters have seemed to ignore the possibility black officers might by sympathetic to their cause. On another night, two black officers tried to get protesters to move from the street onto the sidewalk in front of the Barclays Center. A white woman gave one of them a hard time, but he remained polite.
Then a white man walked up behind him and yelled, “He wants to stomp on your neck and kill you!” The officer flashed a look of exasperation before turning around and asking the woman, again, to move toward the sidewalk.
Other protesters have tried to make black officers feel guilty, suggesting they are insufficiently upset about Floyd. “They’ll say, ‘How do you feel if it was your child? If that was your husband or that was your father?’” Faison, in Queens, said. “It’s not about a side. I experience the same pain that you experience.”
Officer Oriade Harbor, 38, a transgender black man assigned to Police Headquarters, said that even though he often speaks out against what he sees as social injustice, when he does police work he is still seen as “part of a system that is oppressive to black people.”
“People treat me different in uniform, because they only see the uniform,” he said. He added, “At the end of the day I am a black person who dons a blue uniform. I am a trans male. I walk in all of these worlds.”

El acrónimo, que en inglés se refiere a personas negras, indígenas y de color, de pronto está en todas partes. ¿Logra el fin con el que fue ideado?
Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times.
Los estadounidenses negros han sido llamados por muchos nombres en Estados Unidos. Afroamericanos, negros, de color y el insulto impronunciable que, en inglés, rima con bigger . En las últimas semanas, a medida que las protestas contra la brutalidad policial y el racismo han inundado las calles y las redes sociales, otro término más incluyente se ha atribuido a la población: BIPOC.
En inglés, el acrónimo significa “negro, indígena y persona de color” ( black , indigenous y people of color ). Aunque ahora es omnipresente en algunos rincones de Twitter e Instagram, la referencia más temprana que The New York Times pudo encontrar en las redes sociales fue un tuit de 2013.
Como frase, “personas de color” se remonta varios siglos —se citó por primera vez en el Oxford English Dictionary en 1796 , con la grafía británica “colour”— y a menudo se abrevia como POC. Las otras dos letras, para negro e indígena, fueron incluidas en el acrónimo para dar cuenta de la supresión de las personas negras con piel más oscura y de las personas nativas americanas, según Cynthia Frisby, profesora de comunicación estratégica en la Escuela de Periodismo de Missouri.
“El negro y el indígena se agregaron para asegurarse de que fuera incluyente”, dijo Frisby. “Creo que el propósito principal de aquello era incluir voces que originalmente no se habían escuchado y que querían incluir en la narrativa, piel oscura, negros y grupos indígenas, para que pudieran asegurarse que todos los tonos de piel estuvieran representados”.
Charmaine Nelson, profesora de historia del arte en la Universidad McGill, dijo que la historia de los pueblos negros e indígenas en Canadá exige la distinción entre ellos y otras personas de color. En algunas partes de Canadá, principalmente al este de Ontario, los pueblos indígenas fueron colonizados pero no esclavizados, dijo, a diferencia de los africanos que fueron sometidos a la esclavitud en todas partes.
“Entendemos que bajo el colonialismo los pueblos africanos e indígenas tuvieron experiencias muy diferentes”, dijo Nelson. “Combinar todo en uno es borrar, que es la naturaleza misma de la práctica genocida”.
Si la intención era ayudar a explicarlo, algunos no están recibiendo el mensaje. En las redes sociales, muchos asumieron que el término significaba “personas de color bisexuales”. Otros lo leen como “biopic”, la abreviatura de película biográfica. El término ha causado confusión, y no hay un acuerdo universal sobre lo que significa o a quién incluye, pero para la mayoría, ‘personas de color’ incluye a latinos y asiáticos.
El tuit anterior dice, en español: [@SamSanders “Ayer me di cuenta que ‘BIPOC’ de hecho NO significa ‘persona bisexual de color] y el posterior dice: [@JeffIhaza “cada vez que leo bipoc leo biopic”].
Frisby dijo que la parte más significativa del acrónimo era incluir a los pueblos indígenas —que también están pidiendo que la policía cambie— en discusiones donde se menciona la raza.
“Lo que sabemos es que, en la mayoría de los casos, han sido prácticamente inexistentes en cualquier discusión sobre raza o cualquier discusión de cualquier tipo de cosas”, dijo. “No vemos ninguna narrativa que los incluya. Lo que vemos cuando se incluye a los pueblos indígenas son los deportes. Tenemos controversias por imágenes y mascotas, y luego tenemos los productos que se respaldan en los pueblos indígenas, como la mantequilla y la margarina de Land O’Lakes”.
Muchas personas negras están abiertas a dar espacio a la situación difícil de los nativos americanos, pero existe una frustración cuando se trata del término BIPOC.
“Es indolente meternos en el mismo saco como si todos enfrentásemos los mismos problemas”, dijo Sylvia Obell, anfitriona del pódcast de Netflix Okay, Now Listen . “Cuando los mezclas a todos de esta manera, es un borrado. Permite que la gente se las arregle para no conocer a las personas de color y el conjunto de problemas que enfrentamos por separado. Permite que las personas jueguen a lo seguro y no dejen a nadie afuera, y también te permite no tener que hacer el trabajo”.
En un momento en que los negros estadounidenses piden que se diga en voz alta los nombres de quienes fueron asesinados a manos de la policía, y cuando los negros están pidiendo un trato igualitario a escala mundial, tratar de encajar a todas las personas de color y pueblos nativos americanos en un solo término puede parecer insensible.
“El punto es que queremos ocupar espacio”, dijo Obell. “Tómate el tiempo para decir negro, latinx y asiático. Di nuestros nombres. Tómate el tiempo para aprender. Muéstrame que sabes la diferencia”.
Intentar representar tantas identidades diferentes en un solo término es un producto del colonialismo, según Chelsey Luger, entrenadora de bienestar en el Native Wellness Institute, e integrante de Turtle Mountain Band de Chippewa, una nación tribal en Dakota del Norte.
“Es un término redundante en todo caso”, dijo Luger. “Todas las personas de color son indígenas. Muchas personas de color no son reconocidas como tales y no tienen una conexión con esa idea porque su identidad indígena ha sido borrada a través de técnicas de asimilación o simplemente la conexión con nuestras historias y nuestra historia nos ha sido violentamente arrebatada”.
Según Luger, la comunidad indígena critica las designaciones “nativos americanos” y “primeras naciones”, como se llama a los indígenas en Canadá, porque su diversidad no se ve reflejada en dichos términos.
“El hecho de que las personas piensen que somos un grupo homogéneo y que no reconozcan nuestra diversidad contribuye a nuestra deshumanización”, dijo Luger. “Es de conocimiento general que los europeos y los estadounidenses blancos provienen de entornos multinacionales complejos con historias muy diversas. Es peligroso cuando perpetuas la noción de que los negros y los pueblos indígenas de color son homogéneos”.
Algunos se sienten cómodos diciendo BIPOC.
“Fue como: ‘¿Debería llamarlos negros o afroamericanos?’, pero BIPOC salió recientemente”, dijo Gabby Beckford, creadora de contenido sobre viajes. En un video publicado en su canal de YouTube, explica la diferencia entre los términos.
“No creo que se suponga que sea divisorio”, dijo Beckford en una entrevista. “Si estás hablando sobre personas negras, no digas BIPOC. Si estás hablando sobre la vigilancia policial en Estados Unidos, puedes decir personas negras. Puede parecer perezoso, pero si estás hablando de personas de color en general, en comparación con la experiencia blanca, creo que deberías decir BIPOC”.
Otros solo quieren que los incluyan en el proceso de proponer los términos formulados para representarlos.
“Es como cuando pedimos que arrestaran a los policías que mataron a Breonna Taylor y ellos dicen: ‘¿Y si aprobamos una ley?’”, dijo Obell. “Estamos pidiendo muchas cosas, y ser llamados BIPOC no es una de ellas”.
“Dejen de tomar decisiones por nosotros sin nosotros”.

Choreographer Martha Graham “had been in a valley of despair.”
It was 1937 when Graham, worried about the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism in Europe, confessed her state of mind in a letter to composer Henry Cowell. “Whether the desperation lies in Spain,” she wrote, “or in a memory in our own hearts, it is the same.”
The result was her solo “Immediate Tragedy,” a companion piece to another dance inspired by the war, “Deep Song.” Both featured music by Cowell; both were explorations of harrowing events. In “Immediate Tragedy,” Graham told him, “I was dedicating myself anew to space, that in spite of violation I was upright and that I was going to stay upright at all costs.”
“Immediate Tragedy” is a lost work, yet its of-the-moment title, along with Graham’s determination to remain upright no matter what, feels right for the current moment. Now the solo is coming back — reimagined for the digital world and for multiple dancers.
Before the coronavirus struck, the Martha Graham Dance Company had worked on creating a new version of the solo for the stage using archival materials as a guide: among them letters; a lively description of Graham performing the work by choreographer José Limón; and 35 photographs, by Robert Fraser, Barbara Morgan and George Platt Lynes. Composer and conductor Christopher Rountree, who leads Los Angeles ensemble Wild Up, was working on a new score. (The Cowell music was lost, too.)
But with the dancers in quarantine, Janet Eilber, the company’s artistic director, had an idea to keep them working while sheltering at home. “Why don’t we use all the ephemera that we collected for ‘Immediate Tragedy’ for a completely different project?” she said. “Let’s see what we can build out of it for the digital world referencing today’s immediate tragedy.”
On Friday, the Graham company, in collaboration with Wild Up and the Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for the Performing Arts in Los Angeles, will present the premiere of the new “Immediate Tragedy.” (The video will be available starting at 7 p.m. Eastern on the Facebook pages of the Soraya and the Graham company; the Graham company’s YouTube channel will feature it on its Saturday Martha Matinee presentation. “Immediate Tragedy” will remain up indefinitely on Graham’s YouTube site.)
“We started out liking the idea of space as an underlying theme because in Martha’s quote, she says she’s dedicating herself ‘anew to space,’ ” Eilber said. “Because all of our space was so limited, we were considering space in a completely different way.”
But after the protests ignited by the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, the theme — or the feeling of the dance — expanded. “The great thing about Martha’s abstraction is it can contain so many different issues and tragedies,” Eilber said. “Her best works absorb the context of just about any era.”
For dancer Leslie Andrea Williams, the events of the last few weeks changed the tone of her performance. At first, she said, she was full of angst brought on by feeling isolated and “wanting to escape this reality.”
But when she reshot her section — she had to fix the lighting — she felt “acute grief,” she said. “It’s that idea of blood memory: You feel this weight, and you also feel confused.”
The dancers were tasked with creating phrases of choreography; each was given four photographs from which to draw inspiration. “One of the directions the dancers got was to try to get inside Martha’s head, and part of their direction was really to stay in the Graham world,” Eilber said. “They could be creative about it, but to stay in Martha’s brain. Graham is in their bodies.”
And their archival resources, many discovered by Neil Baldwin, author of the forthcoming “Martha Graham: When Dance Became Modern,” were extensive. Of the photographs, most valuable were those by Fraser, who had great access to the company at the time: He was dating Graham dancer Nelle Fisher. His pictures ended up with the Graham organization a few years ago after Fraser’s son discovered them.
Those images, captured at a 1937 concert — “Robert was in the front row, snapping away,” Eilber said — were part of the reason she thought the solo could be reimagined: His contact sheets show the order of Graham’s poses.
Judging by photographs, which feature Graham in a torso-hugging white top and a long black skirt — “I wore my hair in a new way, like a bull-fighter’s cue [queue], tied with a narrow red ribbon,” she wrote to Cowell — the dance was passionate, daring and full of power. Limón wrote of Graham’s “consummately sinuous torso, the supple, beautiful arms, the hands flashing like rays of lightning,” and her head “thrust forward in defiance, or flung back, far back, as in a despairing cry.”
In the photos, Graham’s positions show her holding her arms high overhead. There is a punch with an arabesque and poses on the knee, which resonate today.
Eilber also provided dancers with photographs from the Spanish Civil War; several feature a fist salute with the thumb not in front, but to the side of closed fingers. “It’s the fist that Martha’s using in the punch arabesque, and it’s the fist that protesters are using right now,” Eilber said.
As the videos dance along the screen there are at times multiple dancers and in other moments only a soloist; it’s hypnotic, as is the score. Rountree said he was inspired by Graham’s oath to remain upright and created space for contemplation as well as action. “In terms of the melodic content, I really wanted something to feel like this thing kept trying to get energy, and the energy keeps getting sucked out of it,” he said. “And then there’s this other music, which is kind of spacious and just chords.”
Along with the music and dance, there is a third creative element at play: the choreography of the film itself. For that, Eilber worked closely with Ricki Quinn of the Soraya who is in charge of digital design and editing the videos, which were shot indoors. “This dance is about space and the restraint is something you can use,” Eilber said. “Part of this exercise is that we are restrained: That works for COVID, and now it works for the racial injustice theme as well.”
And the experiment also showed Eilber something about her dancers, like who has an affinity for choreography. Williams, for one.
“I got to mix my movement style with Martha,” Williams said. “I had to picture if I was Martha, what would I do? Which was pretty insane. But instead of trying to create Graham shapes, I tried to think of it in a very broad sense. The way she choreographed was pretty crazy. She would make sounds and she would sort of swing herself through the air.”
It helped guide her as she came up with movement. “It’s a feeling that causes me to move as opposed to creating shapes,” Williams said. “I started doing the move from the picture, and then I just kept going with it and saw where it took me. Sometimes I would get disoriented. I definitely flung myself through space. It was a lot of going wherever my body took me.”

In the weeks following the killing of George Floyd, tens of millions of dollars have flowed into small nonprofit organizations in Minnesota. Now many donors would like to know how those funds will be distributed.
The Minnesota Freedom Fund, a bail fund that earlier this month only had one full-time employee, has raised more than $30 million alone since Floyd’s death on May 25. Its name became ubiquitous on social media as activists and celebrities posted screenshots of their donations to the fund and implored their followers to match them. (Bail funds raise money to release those who have been jailed, so that they can await trial freely.)
On Monday, the fund announced that it had contributed “well over” $200,000 to bail payments in the weeks since the protests began. That revelation followed an open letter addressed to two other organizations that had seen a surge in donations, Black Visions Collective and Reclaim the Block, asking that the nonprofits be more transparent about fundraising and the allocation of funds.
After the Minnesota Freedom Fund shared the $200,000 figure, several commenters on Twitter expressed disappointment that such a small portion of the donations had been distributed. Some also noted that the fund’s board, as it had been depicted on its website, appeared to be composed entirely of white people. (The web page that lists the organization’s staff has been removed at least twice this month as the board’s membership has shifted.)
Any organization as small as the Minnesota Freedom Fund — which is run by fewer than 10 people, including its board — might have struggled under the weight of such a sudden influx of funding. “Not sure how any small organization would spend $35 million in a matter of 2 weeks when they’ve never dealt with such a large amount of money in their lives,” tweeted Noname, a rapper who helped signal-boost the fund in late May.
But the organization was in a particularly difficult position when it found itself in the spotlight. It had already been grappling with questions about the leadership of its only full-time employee, Tonja Honsey.
Who’s in Charge?
In April, a page called “Tonja Honsey - Native Rachel Dolezal” appeared on Facebook. Its administrators alleged that Honsey, the fund’s executive director, was lying about her identity as an indigenous woman, comparing her to Dolezal, the former Spokane, Washington, NAACP president who posed as a black woman for years.
The page’s administrators called for Honsey to step down from all her organizing roles. The administrators said they would not identify themselves to The New York Times because of concerns about their own safety, but said they were two native women local to Minneapolis.
Honsey said in an email that she was “not able to talk to media at this point,” but that the Facebook page was “untrue.” She pointed to posts on the page made by her mother, who wrote that her daughter was indigenous “on her grandfather’s side.”
The Facebook page also carried a message that Honsey had been ousted from the organization for issues related to those raised by the page.
Honsey said she could neither confirm nor deny whether she was still involved with the fund.
“Because we are in active arbitration, I am unable to comment about that,” said the Minnesota Freedom Fund’s current board president, Octavia Smith.
Smith and her predecessor, Greg Lewin, who was the board’s president until early June, said that turmoil within the organization had detracted from its overall mission.
“Our capacity is taxed for sure,” Smith said. ”Our capacity is definitely taxed.” She added that before the nationwide protests, “our staff was only a staff of one.”
Lewin said that the internal issues — which he said he was unable to comment on in detail — did not inhibit the organization’s ability to get people out of jail, but that it did “hamper our ability to move and collaborate in the community.”
Lewin said that the organization typically identifies those in need of bail money with the help of local public defenders, and that its process depended on lawyers’ involvement. That prevented the disruption related to Honsey from directly affecting the organization’s work, he said, but it also made for a more limited process than many online might have expected.
“Being at the reins of an organization getting this level of attention and resources is a different ballgame,” he said. “That includes public scrutiny. People should be mad, stay mad, stay impatient for change. I’m not sure we’re the perfect vehicle for that impatience but we get it.”
Lewin added that the criticism could be frustrating. “The left is exceedingly good at eating its own,” he said.
“People think because we got money we are now part of the system,” he continued. “It’s like, ‘No.’”
About the Board
The Minnesota Freedom Fund was founded in 2016 by Simon Cecil, then a master’s student at the University of Minnesota. Smith, a friend of Cecil’s, was the fund’s first employee, and became its board president in 2018. In 2019, Smith stepped away from her regular work with the fund but remained listed on its website as “emeritus board president.”
On May 31, though, she briefly cut ties with the organization altogether.
“I had some disagreements around leadership,” she said. “That is probably all I’m able to say.”
Smith, who is black, was asked to come back to the board “in order to steward a just transition of resources and power,” she said. On June 11, she was reinstated as the board’s president.
“Our board has historically been predominantly white, and we recognize that that’s a problem,” she said.
The fund said on Twitter that it had paid “all protest-related bail that has come our way.” Lewin said that it had bailed out 40 people in June. Smith said that most other people who were detained in Minnesota had been cited and released, and were not eligible for bail.
“We would love to use that $30 million and get people out tomorrow,” she said. “But the reality is that the systems that are put in place to prevent that, to prevent black and brown people from having freedom, to prevent people who are poor from having freedom, still exist. So we’re still navigating a toxic system. While also trying to abolish it.”
Smith said she understood why people were upset.
“We’re scaling up to meet the needs of the community while also trying to scale our resources to meet the needs of those who are directly impacted by the harms of mass incarceration,” she said. “That requires deep care and intention. We’re moving. That is all I can say, that we’re moving.”
For the time being, the fund is encouraging donations to other organizations.

Amid all the marches and protests for social justice that took place over the weekend, as they have every day since George Floyd was killed while in police custody on May 25, two stood out: the thousands dressed in white who thronged Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn on Sunday in support of black trans lives; and, farther south, the thousands gathered in Columbia, South Carolina, “fully adorned in their Sunday best,” according to one of the organizers of that city’s Million Man March for racial justice.
They wore suits in bright red, shell pink, dove gray and burgundy; jewel-toned ties and plaid bow ties; striped button-up shirts and crisp white ones. Sundresses and tulle dresses and sleeveless silk tops. And they were gussied up on purpose.
From its inception, the march organizers had specified: “Come in dress attire please.” The point being, said Leo Jones, who came up with the idea for Columbia’s Million Man March, to “reframe the narrative and build a sense of joy in our community to see us looking so well, and marching with such pride.”
Almost every protest movement has its visual signifiers: images etched in the collective memory that crystallize the causes for which they were fought. The white dresses of the suffragists and the women’s rights movements. The neat black suits and white button-up shirts of the original civil rights protests. The Black Panthers in leathers and turtlenecks. The followers of Mahatma Gandhi in Gandhi caps and khadi shirts. The sans-culottes of the French Revolution and the yellow vests of the French revolt centuries later.
But the current moment, in part because of its extraordinary reach and multiracial, multinational dimensions, as well as the fact it has been organized largely over social media without a strategic centralized body, has been notably diffuse. As Robin Givhan wrote in The Washington Post, “There’s no cohesion in the look of the marching multitudes.”
They have been resplendent in the uniform of no uniform.
Richard Ford, a professor at Stanford Law School focused on civil rights and the author of the upcoming “Dress Codes: Crimes of Fashion and Laws of Attire,” noted that “there’s a tension in this moment reflected in questions around dress code, and to what extent do we want to tear down the system or to what extent do we want to reform it.”
Yet, said Eddie M. Eades Jr., another organizer of the South Carolina event, “iconography matters.”
And what both the march in Brooklyn and the march in South Carolina suggest is that the iconography of the current upheaval is beginning to evolve and coalesce.
The Fashion Messages That Failed
To be fair, against the backdrop of everything-goes-activism, attempts to pantomime a message through clothes can seem risible. This was never more true than when members of the House of Representatives took a knee amid the marble walls of Emancipation Hall to introduce the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 wearing matching kente cloth stoles provided by the Congressional Black Caucus.
The impulse was clearly genuine, and with precedent in the halls of government. Caucus members wore a similar accessory at the State of the Union in 2018 in silent visual protest against President Donald Trump’s offensive statements about African countries, and the white suits now regularly worn by congresswomen to send a message are another example of unity through clothing that has been notably effective.
But this time it fell flat. In the end it connected not to the heritage of the civil rights movement but rather to a different political tradition: the lawmaker in cultural costume.
And like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s heavily embroidered gold sherwani worn on a state trip to India, which elicited comparisons to a bad Bollywood star, or the class photos taken during the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum featuring world leaders in local dress that came to be known as “silly shirts,” the gesture was widely mocked.
If you are going to use clothing to underscore a message, you’d better understand exactly what message you are sending.
As the social justice movement enters its second phase, however, segueing from an eruption of sheer anguish and frustration to more specific demands and policy changes, the look is beginning to change, too. The organizers of the South Carolina march specifically used fashion to communicate a set of values and implicit references.
Their aim was to connect to the civil rights leaders of the past and pay them homage; to repudiate old racial stereotypes and attempts by some media outlets and the far right to paint them as antifa (a movement that has its own all-black dress code); to offer a silent riposte to the only other uniform otherwise on view: that of the National Guard and the police.
Indeed, the militaristic look of law enforcement style has been a potent theme in the last few weeks, functioning as a perhaps unintended symbol of much of what the protests are about, including aggression against civilians and the use of unnecessary force.
In their camouflage or riot gear, with hard black plastic armor reminiscent of storm troopers, their faces obscured by masks and sunglasses, the police force has often resembled nothing so much as the representatives of a dictatorship.
“I suspect it has inspired some of the outpouring of support in other countries that may not have our racial problems, but have their own history of authoritarianism,” Ford said. “They recognize that image and what it represents.”
Dressing for History
The Columbia march was not the first gathering to adopt more formal dress. On June 4, a demonstration in remembrance of George Floyd in Harlem was characterized by sharply tailored suits and ties in bright colors and ankara prints, worn both as a mark of respect for the life of the man they were honoring and to shape public understanding.
But the South Carolina event took the idea a step further, using clothing not just to influence perception but also to reflect what the organizers see as a more specific agenda, which includes voter registration, census taking and singleness of principle.
Columbia, which is about 40% African-American, experienced its own shooting on April 8 when police killed a 17-year-old, Joshua Dariandre Ruffin, a case currently being reviewed by local prosecutors.
“For us this was a passing-of-the-baton moment and a time to stand together in a nonmilitaristic way,” Eades said.
The idea began, said Jones, 27, the founder of a media agency, when he saw how a protest in Columbia on May 30 was covered by the media, with heavy emphasis on the riots at the end, conflating the abuses of a few with the actions and pain of the many.
He connected with other organizers, who include Tyrieck Davis Newton, 22, a photographer and videographer; Sterling Jackson, 27, who runs his own entertainment public relations agency; Aisa Blue Davis, 21, a college student; and Eades, 29, a program coordinator at the South Carolina Department of Social Services. They decided to draw a direct line between their plans and the Million Man March of 1995, organized by Louis Farrakhan on the National Mall.
They posted on Facebook and Instagram, reached out to the Nation of Islam for permission to make references to the march, and coordinated with the mayor’s office and the local police force. Local restaurants volunteered to donate water and fruit; businesses gave face masks.
Eades said he understood that wearing suits could be seen as attempting to fit into the very system the protests would like to not just reform but also, in some cases, tear down. But, he added: “As a young African-American man, it was powerful to me to see a well-adorned person who had my skin color. To see how he carried himself, and how he moved. It’s our way of wanting to step forward.”
There is a long tradition of Sunday best in the African-American community dating back decades before the civil rights movement, Ford said. In that sense, he said, the organizers of the march were not playing respectability politics as much as declaring ownership over their own history.
It was, he said, “a repudiation of stereotype and white supremacy. It’s not copying white power structures. It’s a powerful statement on its own.”
Perhaps this is why the idea of adopting a dressed-up march dress code is spreading, even as summer and higher temperatures loom. Jackson said he and his fellow organizers have had inquiries about creating similar marches from Charlotte, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and Charleston, South Carolina.
“I hope it does catch on,” said Mayor Stephen K. Benjamin of Columbia, who spoke on Sunday. “I think optics like this will help move the ball down the field.”
To a point, Eades said, that it is “in the history books one day, and a young person may see it, as I once saw images from the civil rights movement, and say: ‘This is who we are, and who we were.’”

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans signaled on Tuesday that they were coalescing around a narrow set of law enforcement reforms as President Donald Trump signed an executive order to encourage — but not mandate — that police departments alter their behavior, setting up an election-year clash with Democrats who are pushing for sweeping changes to address systemic racism in policing.
On Capitol Hill and at the White House, the moves by Republicans suggested that despite nationwide protests against police brutality and growing public sentiment for overhauling law enforcement, they were unwilling to accept the far-reaching federal measures that Democrats had proposed to make it easier to track and prosecute police misconduct, change standards for using force and institute anti-bias requirements across the country.
“The House version is going nowhere in the Senate,” said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader. “It’s basically typical Democratic overreach to try to control everything in Washington.”
Instead, Republicans said they could vote as early as next week on their own legislation, which is set to be unveiled Wednesday, as they struggle to reach consensus about how to respond to the outpouring of public sentiment in favor of change. But McConnell was noncommittal about whether the Senate would take up the bill, which is being spearheaded by Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., before lawmakers leave for the July 4 recess.
A draft of the Republican measure, obtained by The New York Times, would impose additional penalties on police officers who falsify their reports and offer new funding for local law enforcement units that enforce “duty to intervene” and de-escalation training. And it would incentivize states to close a loophole to explicitly define sexual contact between detainees and police officers as nonconsensual.
The measure will come on the heels of Trump’s executive order, which encouraged overhauling policing, like new restrictions on chokeholds and adherence to high training standards for officers. But the measure does not mandate those initiatives and omits any mention of race or discrimination, the central issues that have animated the current calls for revamping law enforcement after the killings of black Americans by the police.
Speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House and flanked by several uniformed police officials, Trump depicted police misconduct as rare and officers as embattled heroes who must be defended. Through his order, Trump said he was “encouraging” police departments across the nation “to adopt the highest professional standards to serve their communities.”
Activists and Democrats were quick to criticize the action as a mostly symbolic measure that did little to address what they called structural problems plaguing police forces that have led to brutality and death for black Americans.
“The executive order lacks meaningful, mandatory accountability measures to end misconduct,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who urged the administration and Republicans to instead consider Democrats’ legislative proposal. “During this moment of national anguish, we must insist on bold change, not meekly surrender to the bare minimum.”
Later, at a Senate hearing, Republicans and Democrats grappled with the scope of the changes.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, pressed witnesses on their assertions about systemic racism in policing, asking at one point, “Do you believe that basically all Americans are racist?”
Vanita Gupta, the president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, responded, “I think we all have implicit bias and racial bias, yes I do,” eliciting a “wow” from Cornyn.
“I think that we are an amazing country that strives to be better every single day,” Gupta added. “It’s why I went into government, to make a more perfect union.”
Cornyn replied, “You lost me when you want to take the acts of a few misguided, perhaps malicious, individuals and ascribe that to all Americans.”
In other moments, Republicans appeared to be weighing how far to go with their proposal.
S. Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man from Georgia who was killed while jogging after being chased by armed white residents, explained the challenges faced by the families he represents because of qualified immunity, which shields police officers from lawsuits.
The bill proposed by Democrats would change the doctrine, but Scott has ruled out doing so. After Merritt’s testimony, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., urged Republicans to consider modifications to guarantee consequences for misconduct.
“I wrote it down,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Trump’s order does not include any such modifications.
The order instructs the Justice Department to provide federal grant money only to state and local law enforcement agencies that have been, or are seeking to be, credentialed by independent bodies certified by the attorney general. The criteria include “de-escalation techniques” to help prevent routine arrests from suddenly turning violent and early-warning systems to identify problematic officers.
It also requires that law enforcement agencies seeking grants prohibit the use of chokeholds, “except in those situations where the use of deadly force is allowed by law.” That is a potentially major exception: Activists say police officers abuse legal loopholes allowing them to use deadly force when they are threatened. Trump added that his administration was studying new nonlethal weapons that might be distributed to police departments.
The order also directs the attorney general to create a database to track complaints filed against police officers, who sometimes move from department to department without such records accompanying them, in effect granting them a clean slate. It also instructs the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services to study and make recommendations about ways to support police officers responding to calls involving mental health, homelessness and addiction with trained social workers.
Trump said that he had met privately just before the event with the families of nine black men and women who were killed by the police, and vowed to “fight for justice for all of our people,” adding, “your loved ones will not have died in vain.”
In addition to the family of Arbery, Trump said he had met with survivors of Botham Jean, Antwon Rose, Jemel Roberson, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Darius Tarver, Cameron Lamb and Everett Palmer.
“There were a lot of tears, there was a lot of emotion,” the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, told reporters later in the day. “The president was devastated.”
Ja’Ron Smith, a White House domestic policy adviser, said the administration had “quietly worked with these families” to draft the executive order. He called their absence from the Rose Garden event “a mutual decision, because it really wasn’t about doing a photo opportunity” and said that “some civil rights groups have even attacked them for coming.”
It was unclear precisely what groups he was referring to. But Merritt defended their meeting with Trump. The families, he later said during the Senate hearing, were all promised federal investigations into their loved ones.
In his remarks, the president said nothing about racism and derided calls for more sweeping change as a threat to law and order.
“I strongly oppose the radical and dangerous efforts to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police departments,” Trump said. “Law and order must be further restored nationwide,” he added, citing instances of looting and arson on the margins of the national protests against racial injustice. “Americans want law and order, they demand law and order.”
Trump was joined in the Rose Garden by McConnell and Scott, along with other Republicans, and encouraged both chambers to “come up with a solution that goes even beyond what we’re signing today.”
While Scott and other lawmakers were still drafting the legislation, some Republicans voiced concern about it. Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana told reporters that he planned to introduced his own bill to address qualified immunity.
But at his weekly news conference, McConnell signaled that he intended to push ahead with Scott’s legislation and all but dared Democrats to block it on the Senate floor. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, declined to comment on the proposal until it was unveiled Wednesday.
“It will really be up to them to decide how they want to handle this,” McConnell said. “They can either shoot it down as insufficient or be willing to take the risk to go to the bill and see what changes, if any, we can all agree to.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Tony Auliano and his wife, Melinda Lantz, stood, drinks in hand, outside the Factory 380, an Andy Warhol-themed bar on Third Avenue in Manhattan, on a recent Friday night. Auliano, 63, would have rather have been inside the bar, which, like many in New York City these days, is selling drinks to go. But he was happy for any social interaction he could get.
“This is a good thing,” he said, “an opportunity to communicate, come out, have a drink.”
Lantz, a psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Hospital who has worked nonstop since COVID-19 took hold of the city, agreed — so much that she recently invited her co-workers to join her. “I actually hosted an informal and unapproved happy hour on the sidewalk two weeks ago,” said Lantz, 59. “I had all my staff come and anyone who wanted to drink. They felt great. It was like a turning point for my department.”
Of all the New York City businesses impatiently awaiting for official permission to reopen, bars arguably face the biggest challenges. Every aspect of their appeal — large crowds in small spaces, close contact with strangers, mouths constantly open to drink or talk — runs contrary to the watchful guidelines that frame conduct during the pandemic.
That concern has been borne out in recent weeks as patrons have moved outdoors, congregating in large numbers in neighborhoods, like Hell’s Kitchen, with a high concentration of bars. Over the weekend, a video on social media of tightly packed throngs of young drinkers on an East Village street drew a Twitter message from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, threatening to intervene: “Don’t make me come down there,” he warned.
In some neighborhoods, residents have complained to the police about the hazards, noise and even the public urination that outdoor crowds can bring. Fines have been issued.
But in other parts of the city, the groups have been smaller, and bar owners are trying to strike a balance between their business interests and public safety.
In March, the state threw bars a lifeline by allowing them to sell to-go drinks; owners grabbed onto it, first haltingly, then with gusto. Today, there is a barely a block, it seems, without a bar handing cocktails, wine and beer through its front door or window.
The general rule for such service is “take out, don’t hang out.” But patrons, thirsty not only for an adult beverage but also for the social experience they associate with it, aren’t always heeding that. From Murray Hill to Cobble Hill, the city’s bar scene has turned inside out: Outdoor drinking has replaced indoor drinking, with groups of friends socializing on the sidewalk in front of their chosen watering hole, perching on fire hydrants, stoops or chairs provided by the bars.
At some bars, business has been slow to return. When the 166-year-old McSorley’s Old Ale House, in the East Village, started selling its famous dark and light ales to go, in mid-March, it attracted little business and shut down after a few days. “Nobody was coming,” said Gregory de la Haba, who operates the bar. “It seemed too high a risk and not worth the headache.”
Once the weather warmed and more people hit the streets, the bar gave it another shot. The customers showed, and stayed. “I knew every single person that came,” de la Haba said. “What was beautiful was to see all my neighbors, who came over to say, ‘It’s so great to see you open.’”
Kevin Bradford, an owner of Harlem Hops, a beer bar on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, said he understood why his customers might want to linger a bit. “These people have been cooped up so long,” he said. By early June, “the regular people who used to get deliveries opted to walk to the place.”
When citywide protests over the killing of George Floyd began, and Mayor Bill de Blasio imposed an 8 p.m. curfew, the bar crowds dwindled, and some bars closed altogether for a time. But in the days since the curfew was lifted on June 7, they have returned in full force.
Bars have become creative in trying to keep their impromptu street trade safe. Signs requiring or at least imploring patrons to wear masks are posted everywhere, and sidewalks are marked with chalk or tape to show how people in line should space themselves.
But as the crowds grow, proper social distancing is not always possible. Ernesto’s Café, on the Lower East Side, encourages customers to use the park across the street. Patrons of Grand Army, in Brooklyn, have been using closed-off State Street as a patio. And the Factory 380 will send customers on an around-the-block “walktail” stroll. By the time they make the circuit, they’re ready for another round.
Observing safety guidelines while not alienating customers can be tricky. “You ask them to move, they’ll move,” said John Hayes, the owner of Doc Watson’s, on the Upper East Side. “But they’re not going to disappear. You don’t want the last thing they remember is you chased them away.”
For bars, whose business models have turned upside-down since the shutdown began, adjust and adapt is the name of the game. Basquiat’s Bottle, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was an art- and nightlife-oriented place before COVID-19, going into the wee hours. It’s now open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and has had increased food sales.
Before the shutdown, Harlem Hops sold two to three crowlers a week (a crowler is like a growler, but in jumbo-can format). Now it sells 30 to 35 a day.
Just as bar owners are figuring out the new landscape as they go, the people they serve have discovered new advantages to the arrangement.
“During this time of year, sometimes I prefer an outside bar or rooftop, or a place by the water,” said Robert Cabo, 29, an architect and a regular at the Factory 380. “Now, because this is happening, I have no reason not to come here.”
Amid the uncertainty fostered by the pandemic, every week seems like a new world for bars. While a bill before the Legislature could extend the life of the new policy allowing to-go service, the large street gatherings, or a rise in COVID cases, could prompt an edict to halt takeout.
But just as New York residents and bars have quickly become used to the freedom of drinks to go, they may not want to let go of citywide alfresco drinking, even when it’s no longer necessary as an economic alternative for bars.
“For the record,” said David Kuhl, 35, standing with a group of friends outside the Factory 380 one balmy evening, “we prefer this.”

She Spent 16 Years as Morgan Stanley’s Diversity Chief. Now She’s Suing. [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
During Marilyn Booker’s 26-year career at Morgan Stanley, including 16 years as the bank’s global head of diversity, she often felt that too few of its employees were black. She was still trying to rectify the situation, right up until the morning in December when she was fired.
Booker, who is black, is now suing Morgan Stanley and her former boss, Barry Krouk, chief administrative officer for the wealth management division, for racial discrimination and retaliation. She believes she was fired because she pushed too hard to get senior executives in that division to embrace her plan to restructure a program for training black financial advisers. She thought the restructuring would help more recruits succeed.
Racial discrimination suits against Wall Street banks are not new. Within the last 15 years, nearly every major bank has settled a class action for tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. But Booker is one of the highest-profile black employees to pursue legal action against a bank in recent years.
Booker joined Morgan Stanley in 1994 to become the bank’s first global head of diversity, a high-ranking job within the human resources department. She was the public face of the bank’s efforts to diversify, representing it at a hearing in Congress on diversity at big banks and making TV appearances. In 2011, she moved to the firm’s wealth management arm, where she started a group, Urban Markets, which sought to win more black money management clients and help black communities build wealth — a role she held until she was fired.
At first, Booker tried to handle her separation from the firm quietly. She continued to offer help and advice to black employees who reached out to her. But this month, as she watched the nationwide protests over police brutality and the widespread inequality that black Americans endure, she decided it was time to speak up. Her lawyers filed suit Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.
“My story is the same story as those of many black people on Wall Street,” she said in an interview. “Our fate has been tied to the goodness of whatever white person is in charge. That is no way to have a career.”
Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said the bank strongly rejected the allegations and would defend itself “in the appropriate forum.”
“We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the diversity of our employees and have made steady progress — while recognizing that we have further progress to make,” Delaney said. “We will continue to advance our high-priority efforts to achieve a more diverse and inclusive firm.”
Booker said she also wanted to underscore the relatively small amount of money that the bank had earmarked for diversity programs. Last week its chief executive, James P. Gorman, said Morgan Stanley would dedicate $25 million to a new initiative inside the bank and would donate $5 million to the NAACP.
“Morgan Stanley made $41 billion last year — that’s a drop in the bucket; it’s not even a rounding error,” Booker said of Gorman’s $25 million pledge. “People have to put these things in context. If there’s a real business initiative that they’re focused on, he’d put more than six basis points into it.”
Other black employees have sued Morgan Stanley in the past, saying they were marginalized and isolated while trying to do their jobs, then pushed out after they spoke up. In 2007, the bank settled a class-action suit for almost $24 million over middle managers’ treatment of black employees and agreed to spend $7.5 million of that on a wide-ranging overhaul of its hiring and management practices, including new recruiting and mentoring programs.
But current and former employees say not much has changed. The bank has been sued by at least eight former employees in the past four years (not counting Booker), most of whom worked as financial advisers and did not hold managerial positions. In court filings, they described being kept off teams formed by their white colleagues, deprived of business leads those colleagues routinely shared among themselves and left out of meetings with potential new clients.
Booker also experienced incidents of racism, according to her lawsuit. In 2013, when she proposed creating a mutual fund with a minimum buy-in of $5,000 that could be marketed in black communities with the help of black TV host Steve Harvey, the bank’s chief marketing officer told her that Harvey was not “consistent with our brand or our audience.”
(The fund was eventually created — without Booker’s involvement — but it was described as a way to attract millennials.)
Still, Booker thought she could make a difference, especially where Morgan Stanley’s financial advisers were concerned. Their job is to attract new clients — wealthy individuals or well-endowed institutions — and manage their investments for them. They would eventually earn all of their money from commissions on these investments and trades. The black advisers needed extra support, Booker argued, because the isolation they routinely suffered as new recruits, often fresh from college, was making it nearly impossible for them to survive the bank’s three-year training program.
She called her plan Project Genesis. Krouk, she said, initially seemed enthusiastic, assigning two analysts to work on Booker’s team. She soon had them combing through black wealth management trainees’ records and identifying areas in which they could use more support, as well as determining how much it would cost the bank to provide that support. Krouk insisted that the wealth management division’s chief operating officer and its head of diversity be involved as well.
But Booker was thwarted in her attempts to present the idea and her findings to executives other than Krouk, according to her lawsuit. The chief operating officer and the diversity head started canceling meetings with her. She found it harder and harder to speak to Krouk. And whenever she brought it up, she was told that Krouk would have to hear her presentation first and approve it.
On Dec. 9, a Monday, she made her way to Krouk’s office for what she thought was a meeting to finally discuss her ideas for the project. Instead, he steered her into a conference room down the hall, where a human resources representative was waiting.
“This can’t be good,” Booker said.
“I’m so sorry,” the representative said, before informing Booker that her position had been eliminated and that there would be no opportunity for her to find another job inside the bank. Then she offered to send out a note saying Booker had “decided to leave the firm and pursue other opportunities.”
“I was thinking, ‘First of all, I didn’t decide to leave the firm; you guys fired me,’ ” Booker said.
She declined the offer. “I would never have participated in anything like that,” she said, “because that was not the truth.”

Two weeks ago, Abe Conlon and Adrienne Lo decided to declare their solidarity with the fight for racial justice. They did so with two posts on the Instagram account of Fat Rice, their award-winning restaurant in Chicago: one a plain black square, the other a photo of the words “Stand for change” spray-painted inside a heart.
The posts did not have their intended effect. They were immediately condemned on social media as shallow acts of self-aggrandizement, particularly by former Fat Rice employees, who took to the internet with a barrage of complaints about a culture of verbal abuse, rage and racial insensitivity they said had flourished at the restaurant.
Nearly all of the 20 former Fat Rice employees who spoke to The New York Times in recent days described Conlon, 39, as an extreme example of a restaurant-business archetype: a tantrum-prone chef who rules by fear and bullying. He ended one staff meeting, they said, by dumping a can of garbage onto the floor, and flew into fits of anger so severe onlookers feared they would lead to violence.
“Working there was pretty much a nightmare when Abe was around,” said Molly Pachay, 27, a former Fat Rice bar manager.
At a moment when restaurants across the country have made efforts to align themselves with protests over the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis, the furor surrounding Fat Rice shows there are dangers for businesses that try to turn their names into symbols of virtue. Last week, the owners of Mission Chinese Food in New York and of California restaurant chain Boba Guys issued apologies for the racist behavior of staff members — accounts that had emerged earlier but resurfaced after the restaurants declared public support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
The misbehavior that the former Fat Rice employees have described does not include allegations of sexual harassment, which many chefs and restaurateurs have faced in the #MeToo era. But the uproar reveals a growing intolerance for a type of verbal mistreatment that has long been accepted as routine in the industry — one in which blacks and other minorities do much of the hardest work.
Conlon posted an apology to Instagram on June 6. “I have reinforced a culture of hostility and oppression due to my own insecurities,” he wrote in part. “I have much unlearning ahead of me.” (The Instagram account has since been deleted.)
Last Wednesday, he and Lo, 36, the restaurant’s co-owner, said that in response to the criticism, they had closed Fat Rice, which they had converted to a general store focusing on meal kits during the coronavirus shutdown. “We’ve stopped all orders of business in support of the movement and to take time to reflect,” Conlon said. Their roughly 70 employees were laid off in March after a shutdown order took effect in Illinois.
Fat Rice, which opened in 2012, specialized in the food of Macao, a former Portuguese colony in China. In 2018, Conlon was awarded the James Beard award for Best Chef in the Great Lakes Region, and Chicago magazine proclaimed that “Fat Rice may be the most universally beloved restaurant in Chicago.”
But Alex Szabo, 29, who worked as a chef there from 2015 to 2016, said Conlon’s brute management style — “when Abe was on the line, it was as bad as any kitchen I’ve seen,” he said — took an emotional toll on the kitchen staff. He recalls breaking down in front of Conlon one night.
“I told him my life right now makes me want to kill myself, and I do not know what to do,” Szabo recalled. “His response to that was I should just work more.”
Conlon said he did not remember the incident, and in a lengthy interview with The Times, he and Lo took exception to some former employees’ description of Fat Rice as an unsafe place to work.
“I don’t think that’s a fair conclusion for you to make,” Lo said. Many former employees criticized her for not intervening on their behalf more often.
Both Lo and Conlon attributed his behavior in part to his own past “traumas,” including drinking, drug abuse and the way he was treated as a younger chef. In a text message after the interview, Conlon reiterated his belief that he is an example of an industrywide problem that he alone should not have to answer for.
“I am acknowledging that my harsh behaviors, poor leadership and temperament are indicative of the greater problems in the restaurant world in which I have learned them,” he wrote. “I am complicit in my participation in the ‘that’s just how it is, because that’s how it has been’ culture.”
Conlon’s former employees said his outbursts were routine and often alarming. One such incident occurred at the 2018 Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, where Fat Rice had a stall. Conlon became so enraged with an employee who accidentally threw out his breakfast that someone called security.
“I remember security was like: ‘Hey, you need to take it easy. You can’t really talk to people like that,’ ” recalled Conlon, who said he was fatigued, having just returned from an overseas trip to film an episode of “Top Chef.” “I was wrongfully upset.”
Many former Fat Rice employees who voiced complaints about the restaurant on social media say the current push for racial equality should include a reckoning for chefs like Conlon. They point out that abuse in restaurants falls disproportionately on people of color, who often occupy low-level positions that keep them from fighting back.
“Black people have experienced this on a greater scale, but it doesn’t minimize what’s happening under our noses,” said Joey Pham, 32, a former Fat Rice chef who has accused the owners on social media of creating a hostile workplace. “When is it a good time to come out about abuse?”
Fat Rice has been under fire before. Last year, the restaurant made local news when an African American guest complained that it played loud hip-hop music that contained racial slurs. The owners responded by posting a warning in the restaurant that diners could be exposed to explicit lyrics.
In 2017, Ryan Zeh, a chef, said he heard Conlon talking angrily about a female server and became so concerned that he followed Conlon as he approached the employee.
“I thought I needed to be there,” said Zeh, 27. “He’s thrown plates at cooks.”
Pachay, the bar manager, said Conlon was furious with the employee for improperly coursing the meal of a single diner. “Abe verbally berated and abused her for it in front of a crowded bar,” Pachay said.
Conlon never laid hands on the server. He said he doesn’t remember making the threat, and while he admitted to throwing plates, he denied ever having thrown one at an employee.
He nonetheless said he regretted losing his temper and confirmed that it led to his taking a leave of absence from the restaurant, after several employees, including Pachay and Zeh, urged Lo to tell Conlon to seek professional help.
“It wasn’t my incident alone that caused the sabbatical,” said the server who was the target of Conlon’s anger. “It was the tipping point for it.” She asked not to be named because she didn’t want the controversy to hurt her new career.
Conlon spent three weeks in his native Massachusetts, where he took some time to reflect at a yoga and meditation retreat. “Why am I acting this way? What are the behaviors that I need to change?” he recalled asking himself. “It was an important time for me. But it obviously wasn’t enough.”
Sukainah Jallow, 32, said she started working at Fat Rice as a server during Conlon’s leave. “People were very open, telling me, ‘You should be happy he’s not here,’ ” she said.
Still, when Conlon returned, he did not appear to have changed, she said. “I was never personally a target, but people around me were emotionally broken by him,” Jallow said. “He’s been doing this stuff for years. He’s not understanding.”
Jallow is one of several African American former staff members who accused Conlon and Lo of treating black employees differently than white employees.
Some of these differences were subtle, like the way Jallow said Conlon “changed his tone of voice with people who are black,” adopting black slang.
Anisa McGowan, 22, a former server, said Lo once ordered her to cover her head during service when she came to work with an Afro.
“She tried to frame it as a hygiene thing,” McGowan said, “but I don’t believe that, because there were a lot of white people who had shoulder-length hair and didn’t wear it back or anything like that.”
Lo said that all employees, regardless of race, were instructed to wear their hair up and that she was “not picking on” McGowan. “There had been problems with hair in the food,” she said.
But McGowan said she interpreted the attention paid to her Afro as “anti-black,” in part because of the other ways she saw race play out at Fat Rice.
She was particularly troubled watching a young black food runner whom she believed Conlon had singled out for abuse. The former employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of being blackballed in the industry, said he worked at the restaurant for less than a year, in 2017 and 2018, and that he was 20 when hired.
Conlon, he said, “had a lot of animosity toward me personally. I don’t know if it was because I was new or because I was black or because I was young, or because of all three of those things.”
He said Conlon once showed him a photograph on his phone of a “black banjo guy with overalls and a hat and a straw in his mouth.” He said the chef encouraged him to dress up like the man for the restaurant’s New Orleans-themed Halloween party.
“I was like, ‘Why would I do that? I look like this guy?’ ” the former food runner recalled. “He said, ‘Sure, you do.’ ”
Conlon said he remembers the food runner but not the incident he described. “I know that we would have brainstorming sessions when we had events,” he said.
The young man recalled the night Conlon fired him. “He kept pulling me aside so he could yell at me,” he said. “I got really mad,” having taken several months of such treatment. “The last time he pulled me aside into a corner really hard. I walked away from him and he grabbed me again. Then I yelled at him and told him, ‘Don’t touch me.’ ”
Conlon and Lo said the food runner often moved too quickly through the restaurant’s cramped space, sometimes colliding with other people. “He was moving headfirst,” said Conlon, who said he told the young man: “You make me nervous. I’m afraid you’re going to crash into somebody again.”
“I reacted, and I grabbed him by the shoulder because I thought he was going to crash into somebody,” said Conlon, who added that his reaction “wasn’t based on who he was as a person. It wasn’t based on his race.”
Both men say they moved into the alley to continue the argument. The young man said he asked why Conlon kept pulling his arm. “He was like, ‘I thought you were going to attack a guest.’ In, like, five seconds, he changed the narrative into, I was going to attack a guest because I was walking away from him angrily.”
He said Conlon then told him, “I could have called the police on you.” Conlon said doesn’t recall saying that. “I think I was trying to explain what my concerns were to him,” he said, “and why I don’t think it was being heard, and things obviously got heated.”
He fired the employee later that evening. McGowan said the young man told her later that night about the incident.
“That’s a really hard thing to manage,” she said, “to work with people who damn well may call the cops on you.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the public imagination was a unifying figure who bridged America’s bitter racial divide and peacefully liberated the South from Jim Crow.
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who actually existed was spied on and blackmailed by the federal government, arrested roughly 30 times, beaten, stalked and assassinated, and died one of the most disliked people in America.
In life, despite his commitment to nonviolence, he was not seen as a model of socially acceptable protest. But in death, he is presented as such by opponents of newer movements, including the demonstrations that have spilled from Minneapolis into thousands of cities and towns in response to the police killing of George Floyd.
These sorts of transformations happen repeatedly in the accounting and recounting of social movements, historians say. As movements unfold, the most disruptive parts tend to get disproportionate attention, and critics often portray them as representative of the whole. In the retelling, the least confrontational parts get the same treatment: People sanitize the movement for public consumption, downplay its opposition and use the mythologized version to discredit its successors.
So it is that the Rosa Parks in many history textbooks just wanted to sit after a long day of work, when the real Rosa Parks was a longtime activist who sat as a calculated political act; that the suffragists most popularly memorialized are those who circulated petitions, not those who burned President Woodrow Wilson in effigy outside the White House; that the anti-war activists who went to Woodstock are better known than the ones who ransacked draft board offices and destroyed the files.
What emerges is not only an antiseptic image of individual activists but also an oversimplified division between “right” and “wrong” ways to protest that historians and social scientists say impedes understanding of how movements achieve their goals.
“The whole purpose of protest is to interrupt your daily life, to interrupt the previously scheduled programming so you pay attention to something new,” said Deva Woodly, an associate professor of politics at the New School who studies how movements use public discourse. “That’s not necessarily the same thing as condoning setting buildings on fire, but it’s certainly not the case that plain civility is something that would ever work.”
Social movements are almost always messy — and that’s part of what can make them effective, historians say. The neatly packaged narratives exist only in retrospect.
“You can tell a story about civil rights in which Martin Luther King made a good speech and then the government changed — and Martin Luther King did make good speeches, and government policies did change, but a lot of other stuff was happening at the same time,” said David S. Meyer, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. “Promoting social change requires a complicated recipe, and to pull out and identify one ingredient and say ‘this is the one that matters’ is either bad social science or just deceptive.”
The vast majority of the recent protests against systemic racism and police brutality have been peaceful, and they have also become increasingly popular, with public opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement shifting extraordinarily quickly. Polls show that a majority of Americans now believe, for instance, that the police are more likely to use deadly force against black people.
Yet there remains an intense focus on a small subset of behavior. When a recent Monmouth poll, for instance, asked whether respondents supported the protests, it included one specific incident in the question: “the burning of a police precinct in Minneapolis.” While 57% said the protesters’ anger was “fully justified,” just 17% said their actions, when described that way, were.
Some of the most prominent U.S. social movements have involved violent confrontation — from the abolitionist John Brown’s 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry to the Haymarket affair of 1886 to the 1969 Stonewall riots — and the results don’t fit a neat pattern. In terms of plain effectiveness, apart from moral and philosophical considerations, it is not always the case that peaceful protest helps a movement achieve its goals and violent protest hurts it.
Omar Wasow, a political scientist at Princeton, found that the riots after King’s assassination drove some voters toward Richard Nixon’s “law and order” platform in 1968 — yet a year later, Stonewall gave a major lift to the gay rights movement. Researchers have found that the 1992 Los Angeles riots led to “a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls” — yet they also became a major issue in the city’s 1993 mayoral race, in which Angelenos elected their first Republican mayor in 36 years.
Most often, historians say, social movements succeed in the vast space between riots and “civility.”
Public opinion has a poor track record of predicting what will be effective: A Gallup poll in 1961 found that 57% of Americans thought sit-ins and the Freedom Rides hurt the chances of integration in the South. And after the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech, Gallup found that 74% of Americans believed mass demonstrations harmed the cause.
King himself was highly unpopular during his lifetime, as two of his children emphasized.
“There’s always going to be a group that attempts to demonize that which is being done — and for their own purposes, not because it’s right, good or just, but just because they want to foster a different position,” said Martin Luther King III, King’s oldest son. “Dad totally used the method of nonviolence, and he was consistently criticized.”
Bernice King, King’s daughter and chief executive of the King Center, said she believed the sanitized version of his work “reflects attempts to not only diminish my father’s courage and tenacity in speaking truth to power, but also reflects attempts to diminish the power of nonviolence.”
Whether they involve a rally, a raised fist or a bent knee, protests have always drawn a public backlash. In fact, the very tactics some point to as models now were considered too confrontational then — leading King, in his “Letter From a Birmingham Jail,” to denounce “the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action.’”
Carol Faulkner, a historian at Syracuse University, reeled off a list of brutal public responses to peaceful protests as far back as the 1830s, when a white mob tied a rope around the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison’s waist and dragged him through the streets of Boston, and more than 10,000 people descended on a meeting site for abolitionists in Philadelphia and burned it to the ground.
Nineteenth-century women’s suffragists “went out of their way to present themselves as very middle-class, very respectable, and used the tools of respectable politics,” Faulkner added.
But their message made them targets even when their tools were petitions and town-hall meetings, and those tools were not always effective.
In 1860, the suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton addressed the House Judiciary Committee for two hours, after which The New York Times reported, “She was earnest, and eloquent, and plausible, but she must have felt that she was not convincing her audience — and she did not.”
By the time the 19th Amendment was ratified, the movement had split into factions: the moderate National American Woman Suffrage Association, or NAWSA, and the more radical National Woman’s Party. After NWP members burned Wilson in effigy in February 1919, Mary Garrett Hay of NAWSA said their “outrageous performances” undermined the whole movement.
Yet some of the NWP’s actions — or, more precisely, the police treatment of the women arrested for those actions — helped turn public opinion in the movement’s favor, Faulkner said, much as the vicious attacks against civil rights protesters did and police crackdowns may be doing now.
This was an explicit part of King’s strategy: using nonviolent protest to provoke a response that would put the brutality of Jim Crow on display.
“He did not believe in violence, but he believed in nonviolent direct action that would lead to a confrontational crisis situation,” said Daniel Q. Gillion, a professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania and author of “The Loud Minority: Why Protests Matter in American Democracy.” “That’s why he broke the law that he didn’t think was right, and the reason why he sent kids out there to deal with Bull Connor fully knowing that Bull Connor was going to unleash dogs or do something hysterical.”
Gillion ranks the intensity of protests by giving one point for each of nine characteristics: more than 100 participants, duration longer than a day, backing from a political organization, participants carrying weapons, a police response, arrests and — regardless of which side causes them — property damage, injuries or deaths.
He has found that the intensity of protests in a congressional district affects the voting record of the district’s representative, and that intense protests are associated with higher voter turnout among people who are ideologically aligned with the protesters.
In his book “Polite Protest,” Richard Pierce, a historian at the University of Notre Dame, studied a nonconfrontational civil rights movement in Indianapolis and found that it was no more successful than the confrontational movements in other cities.
“They never marched, they never protested out loud, they negotiated, they used meetings — they were still held back,” Pierce said. “Blacks can’t continue to wait around to find an acceptable form of protest that will generate 100% approval on the other side, because that doesn’t exist.”

Full text: Through tear gas and rubber bullets, professional and amateur medical volunteers have stepped forward to aid the injured.
When Safa Abdulkadir, a first-year medical student at the University of Minnesota, attended a protest in Minneapolis in response to the killing of George Floyd, she had no intention of putting her medical knowledge to use. It was May 26, one day after Mr. Floyd was killed, and although Ms. Abdulkadir was attending the demonstration as a protester, she made a point of wearing her white lab coat, a common symbol of medical professionals and students.
"I went more as a sign that there is someone in the medical community who is here supporting the cause," Ms. Abdulkadir said. "I wanted my people to feel as though I was there and supporting them, and feel my presence."
Before long, however, she saw a young woman on the ground crying, a small crowd around her. The woman told her that she had been shot in the breast with a rubber bullet. When Ms. Abdulkadir approached the group, they asked if she was a doctor, and she explained that she was a medical student. Someone asked her to look at the young woman's wound, and bystanders formed a barrier around them so that Ms. Abdulkadir could do so. She discovered some bruising but no severe trauma; she then gave the woman a bandage she happened to have in her pocket and helped find her a cold compress.
"After that day, I decided to just continue going to the protests with the purpose of actually helping people who were hurt," Ms. Abdulkadir said. She and some of her classmates started bringing along basic first-aid supplies, like bandages, gauze, and mixtures of milk of magnesia and water to counteract tear gas. They used red duct tape to put crosses on their white coats, and within a few days found other medical professionals who had set up volunteer triage stations to serve demonstrators.
Ms. Abdulkadir is just one of the many people in cities and towns across the country providing medical care during the George Floyd protests. These volunteers often refer to themselves as street medics, and have a history that stretches back to the civil rights movement. The term refers to a loose, informal group of people with varying degrees of medical experience, from physicians to amateurs, who attend protests and demonstrations specifically to provide medical care that participants may need.
Coalitions of street medics have formed, and many offer a 20-hour training to introduce participants to basic first-aid skills specifically tailored to protests, such as treating people with dehydration or tear gas exposure. Some organizations, like the Do No Harm Coalition, also offer bridge training to introduce medical professionals to the world of street medicine.
Ahmed Owda, a fourth-year medical student at Columbia University, watched one of the coalition's webinars as he was preparing to attend protests as a street medic in New York.
"I'm an African-American male, and that was one of the things that inspired me to come into medicine, the disparities that we witness in communities of color," he said. As he saw documented instances of police violence against protesters nationwide, Mr. Owda said that although he was not yet a doctor, he felt it was important to use his position in, and knowledge of, health care to help protesters in ways that he could. He has been attending protests in New York in his scrubs, with bottles of water and a first-aid kit, but has not yet had to provide direct care.
Duck Bardus, a street medic in Columbus, Ohio, first completed street-medic training at the protests at the Standing Rock Reservation in 2016. Since then, Mx. Bardus has worked hundreds of protests -- but this was the first time they had experienced violence directed at them while clearly marked as a street medic.
"This is the first time I have ever, ever seen anything like what we're seeing on the streets in Columbus," they said. "I have never been shot at with projectiles, I have never been maced at a protest, and all of those things have happened over the last week here in Columbus."
Mx. Bardus estimated that over the past two weeks they have treated 150 to 200 people, most frequently for chemical irritants, and called for an ambulance several times, although emergency medical technicians were not always able to reach injured people through the crowds, highlighting the important role of street medics.
On May 28, Mx. Bardus said that they were with a group of peaceful protesters when police started to "bombard them with mace and pepper spray."
"I treated the same guy three times in 15 minutes," Mx. Bardus said. "I've never in my life seen a protester take chemical irritants like that and just pop back up and go right back. They were very, very resilient. They were determined."
Darien Belemu, a graduate student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that the possibility that an emergency responder might not be able to reach a protester in time was one of his main motivations for working as a street medic at protests in New York. Mr. Belemu has his EMT-B certification, and took a bridge street-medic training course, designed for people who had medical experience, from a coalition in New York.
"I see a lot of 20-year-old, 19-year-old kids that are acting, I think, really heroically and standing up to the police and making sure they know they're not OK with police brutality," Mr. Belemu said. "It scares me to think that somebody is not going to get treatment, especially if they have a head wound and it's going to affect their ability to live a normal, healthy life."
Mr. Belemu said he treated a protester on May 30 whom police had pepper-sprayed directly in the face. When the protester turned to run away, Mr. Belemu said, an officer hit the protester at the base of the skull with a baton. By the time Mr. Belemu reached him, the protester was bleeding profusely.
"That's where your brain stem is, and any swelling there could threaten a person's ability to breathe, or it could stop their heart," Mr. Belemu said. "That was a very scary situation." Mr. Belemu and a nearby medical worker cared for the protester and urged him to go to the hospital immediately if he vomited or developed a throbbing headache.
For many street medics, the coronavirus has only made their work feel more urgent. Police officers have been using tear gas on protesters, which often causes people to cough, potentially adding to the spread of the virus. Some health officials have voiced their concerns, and most street medics have been carrying masks with them to hand out to protesters, as well as trying to change gloves in between treating individuals.
"It makes me really concerned that national guardsmen and police are using things like tear gas and pepper spray in light of the fact that we're in a pandemic, and that those exposures could increase the risk of getting Covid-19," said Dominique Earland, a first-year medical and Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota, who has been working as a street medic in Minneapolis. "It's especially concerning to me, as a black woman, to know that the black community was disproportionately impacted by Covid before, and then they didn't really have any equitable responses."
Mr. Owda shares Ms. Earland's concerns. "Obviously Covid is an incredible disaster," he said. "But in so many ways in my day-to-day life police violence is a bigger threat to me than Covid."
There have been documented instances of the police destroying street-medic supplies, and Ms. Abdulkadir and Ms. Earland said that on May 30, they had to flee a triage tent where they were helping protesters, because police officers started firing rubber bullets near them. "I cannot confirm that," said John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department. "I have no knowledge of it."
Ms. Earland said: "I guess I was naïve, even after most of my adult life seeing police be very brutal to people in the black community. I guess I thought that my white coat maybe could protect me."

In the last two years, Kerby Jean-Raymond, the founder of Pyer Moss, has become something of a New York Fashion Week star, famous for taking the African American experience and putting it front and center on the runway, using such inspiration figures as the black cowboy and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. He has won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award, become artistic director of Reebok Studies and collaborated with Hennessy.
But in 2015, he almost went out of business after a show that opened with a 12-minute video about police brutality titled “This Is an Intervention.” It featured interviews with the relatives of many of the black men who had been killed by police: Eric Garner, Marlon Brown, Sean Bell. Praised and excoriated in almost equal measure, the show thrust the then largely unknown label into the spotlight, and was the first time a designer forced fashion to grapple with its own culpability regarding race.
This is its story — and the first time the video has been shared since that time.
Kerby Jean-Raymond, founder and creative director of Pyer Moss: In July we had done a standing presentation in Tribeca for menswear called “Ota Benga.” At the time, the case of Mike Brown was getting public attention, and Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner. Ota Benga was an African man who was kept in the Bronx zoo ’til 1906. We wanted to juxtapose this story with the modern-day prison system and police brutality, to show we shouldn’t be repeating these mistakes. But at the event I realized it was going over everyone’s heads. People were having a good time. They were reacting, but they weren’t reacting the way I wanted them to. So that night at dinner we were like, “Let’s turn this into a runway and do a second show.” Two months later, we did a women’s collection for the first time.
Brittney Escovedo, show producer, Beyond 8: We spoke a lot about the fact this industry is in a lot of ways, and especially at that point, not penetrated by these stories. They’re not talking about it. The editors, the journalists, the influencers that come to these fashion shows aren’t thinking about these issues. So we have 20 minutes of people’s attention, and we can use it as an opportunity.
Jean-Raymond: Before that, we were strictly a menswear brand. The company wasn’t doing well. I was in a partnership with a backer, and they were pretty much fed up. I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t address these issues. I was prepared for it to be my last show.
Dario Calmese, show director, then casting director: So much of one’s existence in the fashion space was trying not to ruffle too many feathers. For you to take a stand as a quote-unquote black person would kind of eliminate you.
Jean-Raymond: I knew I wanted a video, knew I wanted an experiential element. A live art element. Wanted Brenmar to do the music live. There were a lot of moving parts. It was probably the most complicated thing I had done. We started shooting a guerilla-style documentary that featured Usher, people in the fashion industry and the family members of victims of police brutality. I think we shot the whole thing for $1,500.
Escovedo: It wasn’t hard for me to reach out to the families because I felt like it was important, but it was hard for them to trust us and to understand what our motives were. I remember having multiple conversations sharing who I am, who Kerby is, what the brand stands for and that this wasn’t just about death and loss. It was about what this could be: education, love, so much more than just being shot.
Shikeith, artist and one of the “This Is an Intervention” editors : Kerby and his team handled the principal photography for the project — they had shot the footage of the interviews. There was a decision to include YouTube clips of police brutality, to project light on what was happening all around this country. There were hours and hours of footage of various public figures. I remember sitting with all of that in front of me, at 24.
Calmese: We knew that we were all taking a risk, and it was very important that we all do it together — the entire team. It was almost like a pact that we signed up for, because although Kerby wanted to make a statement, we were all part of that statement.
Clara Jeon, publicist : Then we lost a venue.
Escovedo: We had talked to the New Museum about potentially having it there, and once we shared what the show was about, they just declined and said we couldn’t have the event there.
Jean-Raymond: We had to scramble and ended up with a venue that was too big and way out of our price range, the Altman Building on 18th Street. We ended up paying close to $20,000, which was definitely money we didn’t have.
Jeon: I remember thinking, “Wow, maybe this is a sign that we’re not supposed to do this.” I was really scared about what people would say. We already had some people we thought were partners backing out before anything had even gone public. What if fashion media — who at the time weren’t even covering Pyer Moss widely — what if this is the thing that makes them not take us seriously as a fashion brand? I don’t think people realize how close we came to not doing this show and canceling it altogether.
Jean-Raymond: Then, right before we did the show, right outside my apartment in Southside Jamaica, Queens, I had a cast on my hand, was talking to my sister on the phone, was coming in from buying a beef patty, and I look up and I hear, “Put it down, put it down!” And these cops had their guns drawn on me.
Jeon: He told me the next day, when we were walking around SoHo. He said, “I could have gotten shot last night.” That was the time — I’m not black — when I felt what the black community must feel all the time, that fear of losing your friend or your son or your husband at any given moment over just living your life. That was when my mind was made up. I was like, we need to do this.
Jean-Raymond: I wanted to invite the families of the victims. Editors and whomever was coming to the show — they would have another opportunity to be at a show, but these people deserved to be honored. So I was like: The front row is yours. Press and editors can sit second row.
Jeon: Seating is extremely stressful for publicists, because it is very political. It is the way a brand communicates to editors and publishers their relationship with them or priorities. I preemptively tried to explain that it would be the families of victims in the first row, so the second row is the best seating available. The majority of press understood. A couple would not come to the show.
Jean-Raymond: It was crazy, because most of the I’m-not-comings came from black stylists.
Calmese: We really wanted a diverse cast. I don’t think we were at the point where we were making a statement with casting all-black models. But we definitely wanted to open with one and make sure they had a substantial presence on the runway. The casting job continued all the way up until the show because one model was stuck in fittings for, I believe, Alexander Wang, and I actually had to pull a blogger from the audience and put her in the show. I told her: “Give us your Venmo. We’ll send you some cash.” I didn’t know her name. She just came to enjoy the show.
Jon Reyman, hairstylist, Aveda: Kerby and I had talked about what he wanted a few days before — whether it should be big, or small, or sort of like a flat top — but right before the show he called me and said he just wanted it as simple as possible, so it would almost disappear. So it wouldn’t call any attention to itself, or be part of the story.
Jean-Raymond: What I initially wanted to do was not even have clothes and put everyone in tights. I wanted everyone to feel a sense of nakedness, to put black bodies on display.
Jeon: That had actually been a discussion in the days leading up to the show: Do we even show clothes? Is that still something we do? But it’s a fashion show. People come to see clothes. And we wanted to make it clear that we wanted to be at the forefront of a conversation in fashion, within the industry, where this was just not talked about ever.
Shikeith: Outside of the show, there was a truck that had a projection of one of the designs that I made, a globe that said “Pyer Moss News.” As it pertains to the media, and how black life and blackness is portrayed, there’s a sort of a reductive lineage that is caught up in caricature and stereotype — all racist, all symptoms of white supremacy. For the show, it was important to emphasize the control we had over the narrative through this signifier of “Pyer Moss News,” to represent taking control of the narrative and speaking to truth.
Gregory Siff, artist who spray-painted the collection live: Everything is dark. The audience is out there. The film goes on, and it’s like a punch to your gut.
Jeon: We didn’t really tell people what to expect. We maybe should have, but I would say 99.9% of that room had no idea what they were sitting down to watch. After the video, there was 2 to 3 seconds of complete silence before people started to applaud.
Jean-Raymond: After the movie, people were gasping, some people were crying, some people walked out, and I started to get cold feet about what we were doing. I told Dario not to send the models out. And he got so combative with me and was like: “I’m sending them out! I’m sending them out!” I was just standing behind the projector screen. I was like a little kid in trouble because of what we’d just shown everyone.
Siff: Then Kerby whispers to me — he was next to me — “Now, go out there and shake the can.” It was all silent, in the dark, and then the lights come on, and I am shaking this can.
Escovedo: The models all stood on a U-shaped runway, and they stayed there, straight-faced, and you could actually feel the life and souls of those we had lost in the models that were standing there.
Calmese: We’re always trying to marry runway and presentation. So the models were coming out in this really kind of militaristic style, but in rehearsal I didn’t have enough time to figure out how to cue them to move to the next spot. So I was like, “I’ll just stand in the middle of the runway, and scream ‘Go!’” And every time I did, the models would move.
Siff: I think there were three to five models I painted. For me, it all happened so quickly. I was reacting in the moment. I had painted all the boots beforehand: a lot of repetition of “I can’t breathe,” which was Eric Garner. “Call my Mama.” Some of the shoes had black overspray. But having written so many times on the shoes, “I can’t breathe,” I felt like I needed to write the opposite. So the last line I painted was “breathe, breathe, breathe” on the back of one of the jackets.
Calmese: The last model didn’t get the instruction right — Gregory had spray-painted on the back of her jacket, but you couldn’t see it. So I walked onto the runway and grabbed her shoulders and threw her around. I think I might have made the last picture on Style.com.
Jean-Raymond: I was watching the crowd reaction from the side of the stage, and everyone was off their phones. There’s very little video footage from that show because people were off their phones. At the end, people wanted to clap, but we shut the lights off and you heard Oscar Grant’s mom — she had sent us audio because she couldn’t come — and that put everyone back in their seat.
Reyman: Charity events, galas are used to celebrate and bring awareness and raise money. But this was the first time I saw a designer really using his fashion as a platform to speak out against injustice, and so overtly. It was very much: I have you captured in the audience, you’ve shown up, and I am going to show you something you may not know about.
Jeon: While there was a lot of public positivity in the press that covered it, a lot of support in terms of sympathizing with the black victims and wanting to help address the issue, it also opened us up to direct attacks on social media: backlash from white supremacists, people who thought that our message was an attack on police and would send us #bluelivesmatter messages, who said we had no business showing something like this at a fashion show.
Jean-Raymond: I started getting death threats. They had me on a watch list for stormfront.org, a white supremacy forum. I was getting emails like “I’m going to kill you nigger.” Lots of stores dropped their orders. It put me in a really dark place.
Escovedo: Kerby didn’t know if his business would stay around or if he was going to make it. And once he did, and got through, that set the tone for him understanding the importance and significance of being a black man in America, a black designer, and solidified his voice and all of our purpose.
Calmese: A big question is: What was the impact? How are we moving forward? What lessons have been learned? Have there been any lessons learned?

NEW YORK — A few hours after the Manhattan district attorney announced he would not prosecute some of the protesters who had been arrested during demonstrations against police brutality, the Police Department sent him a message: All the officers assigned to his office would be pulled off the job to help with crowd control.
The district attorneys in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens made similar decisions and received the same news.
Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said Friday that the timing was unrelated to the prosecutors’ decisions. Resources were pulled from the entire department to cover the protests, he said.
But to some in the prosecutors’ offices, the episode was emblematic of a growing divide between the police and most of the city’s district attorneys over how to address public outrage about racial disparities that pervade the criminal justice system.
As thousands have taken to the streets in New York City to protest the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and more broadly, systemic racism in America, the city’s prosecutors have taken an increasingly liberal stance on issues of policing.
The prosecutors went so far last week as to support the Legislature’s decision to make chokeholds a crime and to repeal a law that kept police misconduct records secret — a forceful disavowal of the status quo, which largely protected abusive officers.
“We must take action against the use of excessive force by the police,” said a statement signed by four of five of the city’s district attorneys. In a separate letter, the Staten Island district attorney expressed his support for the Legislature’s actions.
In a sense, the growing distance between the two pillars of local law enforcement reflects a political reality. Unlike police commanders and police union leaders, the prosecutors must stand for reelection in a city where public opinion has swung hard over the last month in the direction of reining in the Police Department and cutting its budget. But the decision to drop charges against some of the protesters is also part of a longer-running trend.
In recent years, the district attorneys in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx — now joined by Queens — have scaled back prosecutions for minor crimes like marijuana possession and turnstile jumping, because disproportionate numbers of black and Hispanic residents were arrested for these offenses, and prosecutors did not believe they were serious enough to justify a criminal record. More recently the prosecutors have declined to seek convictions for many social-distancing violations for the same reason.
On Friday, Shea denied that the police leadership and the district attorneys were at odds. For the last six years, he said the Police Department also has been steadily shifting its strategies, though, he added, “maybe not as fast as some people like.”
“Are we always in lockstep? No,” he said. “We’re human beings and from different agencies.” Still, he noted arrests and summonses have been cut dramatically over the years, and officers have been focused on violent crimes rather than minor offenses.
But some senior police commanders were furious about some district attorneys’ decisions not to prosecute, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal meetings. Police union leaders said some of the prosecutors were caving in to public pressure and picking which laws they wanted to enforce.
“It is a dereliction of duty to their oath of office,” said Edward D. Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association. “More important than undercutting the work of the NYPD, it is undercutting public safety.”
Police personnel were also pulled from the district attorney’s office in Staten Island, which tends to take a more conservative approach to law enforcement than the prosecutors in the other four boroughs. Ryan Lavis, a spokesman for the office, did not respond to several requests for information on how the office was handling protesters accused of minor offenses.
Two weeks ago, a few days into the protests, demonstrations turned violent as police officers and protesters clashed in the streets. Images of burning police vehicles and looting led the mayor to impose a curfew.
But videos of officers using excessive force on demonstrators also appeared on social media and on the evening news, and after the curfew was imposed, officers were filmed using batons on peaceful demonstrators who appeared to have done little more than march past the deadline. The mayor and the police drew fire from many elected officials.
On June 6, four of the city’s five district attorneys said that they would not pursue convictions against people arrested on minor charges at protests, though they all said they would prosecute people accused of violence against officers and looting. District attorneys in other major cities like Los Angeles and Miami had made similar announcements.
“The protests are important, powerful and are very positive,” the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a recent interview. “We need to make sure we protect that activity.”
The Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, took a similar position, saying, “We stand for the right of people to protest.” In Queens, District Attorney Melinda Katz said her office would not prosecute anyone who had merely protested, “which is a First Amendment right.”
Beyond immediate political considerations, the prosecutors’ decisions reflected differing philosophies on law enforcement in the city. The district attorneys have moved away from their traditional role as law-and-order enforcers and have embraced efforts to put fewer offenders in jail.
Gonzalez has been at the forefront of the move to reduce the jail population and has clashed with the police over gun arrests. He has tossed many cases in which searches were possibly unconstitutional and has diverted young gun offenders into community programs instead of jail.
Vance also has said that he is committed to minimizing unnecessary interactions with the criminal court system and reducing racial disparities and the effect on people’s lives that low-level prosecutions have.
“The justice system shouldn’t be the first resort,” Vance said in an interview. “It should be used only when necessary, especially for low-level offenses, which tend to fall on men and women of color and those economically less resourced.”
Katz, who is in her first year as the Queens district attorney, has taken a similar stance, saying that it makes more sense, for instance, to divert low-level drug offenders to social service programs. “You shouldn’t have a record for that following you for the rest of your life,” she said.
Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy nonprofit, said the police still feel a responsibility to respond to “quality of life issues,” like people who congregate on a street corner where marijuana is being sold. But he said that prosecutors “feel like it’s low-level crime and nothing really happens, so why spend the resources?”
“There’s two competing perspectives here,” he said.
The scaling back of the types of crimes district attorneys are willing to prosecute has widened the rift between the police and prosecutors, some policing experts said.
“There are no more law-and-order district attorneys,” said Joseph L. Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “The pendulum has swung so far left.”
Not only have the district attorneys declined to prosecute protesters charged with unlawful assembly, disorderly conduct and curfew violations, but they have been aggressively going after police accused of assaulting protesters. About 40 officers are under investigation, officials have said.
In Manhattan, employees in Vance’s office have been scouring social media for videos of police abuse. The office is investigating allegations that officers assaulted Wall Street Journal reporter Tyler Blint-Welsh, who is black and was covering the protests and had his press badge displayed.
The office is also reviewing the conduct of officers from a violent social-distancing arrest on May 2 in the East Village in which one of the officers sat and knelt on the neck and upper torso of a man he was arresting.
In that case, Vance declined to prosecute the men accused of violating social-distancing rules. Enforcement of these rules has targeted black and Hispanic men, The Times has reported.
In Brooklyn, Gonzalez charged police officer Vincent D’Andraia with misdemeanor assault after video showed that he violently pushed a woman during a protest. The woman was hospitalized with a concussion as a result of the encounter.
“Individual cases are one thing that we can do as district attorney,” Gonzalez said. “But we have to make structural and systemic changes to prevent these acts from happening again.”

NYPD Disbands Plainclothes Units Involved in Many Shootings [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — The New York police commissioner announced on Monday that he was disbanding the Police Department’s anti-crime units: plainclothes teams that target violent crime and have been involved in some of the city’s most notorious police shootings.
Roughly 600 officers serve in the units, which are spread out across the city and work out of the department’s 77 precincts and nine housing commands. They will immediately be reassigned to other duties, including the detective bureau and the department’s neighborhood policing initiative, the commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, said.
Shea said the plainclothes units were part of an outdated policing model that too often seemed to pit officers against the communities they served, and that they were involved in a disproportionate number of civilian complaints and fatal shootings by the police. He said the department now depends much more on intelligence gathering and technology to fight crime and “can move away from brute force.”
“This is a seismic shift in the culture of how the NYPD polices this great city,” Shea said. “It will be felt immediately in the communities that we protect.”
The unexpected announcement came after weeks of protests and public unrest over police brutality after the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a black man who was killed when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Within the department, the anti-crime units were seen as an elite force aimed at disarming criminals in the city’s most violent pockets. Created with the mission of ridding the street of illegal guns and stopping violent crimes, the units were widely seen as a steppingstone for ambitious officers who hoped to join the Detective Bureau.
But for critics of the department, the anti-crime units have become a symbol of the aggressive policing strategies that are now being called into question by the protest movement. Not all are being disbanded: Those that work in the city’s transit system will remain in their role, Shea said, and plainclothes units will continue to operate in other divisions of the police department.
Shea said Monday that the anti-crime units were a vestige of the city’s era of “stop-and-frisk,” when officers routinely searched people in high-crime areas, a practice that a judge declared unconstitutional after finding it disproportionately affected people of color.
“This is 21st-century policing,” Shea said of his decision to disband the units. “The key difference — we must do it in a manner that builds trust between the officers and the community they serve.”
The anti-crime units have been routinely touted by the department’s leaders as a key tool to fight crime in some of the city’s most dangerous neighborhoods. They have been credited with taking thousands of illegal guns off city streets.
The officers in the units took on their own roguish image: The assignment was seen as dangerous, reserved for the tough and the brash, the pinnacle of good-guy-gets-the-bad-guy policing. Among the rank-and-file, the abolishment of the plainclothes units is likely to be seen as a retreat from traditional police work.
“Anti-crime’s mission was to protect New Yorkers by proactively preventing crime, especially gun violence,” said Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union. “Shooting and murders are both climbing steadily upward, but our city leaders have clearly decided that proactive policing isn’t a priority anymore.”
But among experts on policing, Shea’s announcement was seen as an enterprising response to mounting pressure to overhaul how the department operates within the city.
“It’s really sending the message that we have to work on trust building. You can reduce crime, but if the public still feels that they don’t trust the police, then you’ve lost the moral high ground,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a law enforcement policy nonprofit. “Police departments across the country will see this as a wake-up call.”
Public defenders and civil rights lawyers viewed the move with wary optimism, saying they could not be sure if it would turn out to be cosmetic or a lasting change.
Darius Charney, a staff lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a civil rights group, said that the decision to disband the anti-crime teams seemed sudden and rushed. He also noted that Shea did not mention the borough-based anti-crime teams that were “some of the worst” offenders at the height of stop-and-frisk.
“For this change to have any meaningful impact on how communities experience policing in NYC, these former anti-crime officers will need to change the way they police communities of color, and nothing the commissioner said gives me any confidence that the NYPD has a plan to make sure that happens,” Charney said.
Charney noted the city had embarked on a similar mission in 2002, when it disbanded its plainclothes Street Crime Unit. “The problem got much worse over the next 10 years,” he said.
The anti-crime units had absorbed the remnants of the city’s plainclothes Street Crime Unit, which had begun three decades earlier.
The Street Crime Unit was disbanded by Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly after years of simmering criticism over the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo. Plainclothes officers had shot Diallo, a street vendor, 41 times after mistaking his wallet for a gun. Kelly reassigned the remaining Street Crime officers to various anti-crime units across the city.
Though the anti-crime officers account for only about 2% of the department’s uniformed force, they have been involved in a disproportionate number of shootings by the police.
A 2018 review of fatal police shootings in New York City conducted by The Intercept, an online publication, found that plainclothes anti-crime officers had been involved in 31% of the incidents since 2000.
In 2018, anti-crime officers shot and killed Saheed Vassell, a mentally ill man who pointed a metal pipe toward them like a gun on a busy Brooklyn street. Vassell, 34, was known as an idiosyncratic fixture in the neighborhood, and patrol officers were familiar with the man’s bizarre antics. The anti-crime officers who responded, however, were part of a team that did not routinely work in the area and didn’t know Vassell.
Last September, an anti-crime unit officer, Brian Mulkeen, was shot and killed by his partners in the Bronx while he struggled on the ground with Antonio Lavance Williams. Williams was also killed in a police fusillade. The police said Williams was found to be carrying an illegal gun, but it remains unclear why Mulkeen and his partners tried to stop and question him in the first place.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Shea also have come under pressure from protesters and elected officials to reduce the size of the Police Department and shift resources into social programs. The City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, has proposed slashing the Police Department’s $6 billion budget by $1 billion.

NEW YORK — The critical indicators surrounding the coronavirus crisis in New York have clearly turned a corner: Deaths have slowed to a trickle, new cases have declined sharply and the numbers of hospitalizations and intubations have eased.
But over the weekend, a more ominous sign emerged. Throughout New York City, many people openly disregarded social-distancing rules, prompting state officials to threaten to reinstate restrictions in the city to guard against a second wave of infections.
“We have 22 states where the virus is increasing,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at a news conference Monday. “It’s a dramatic national turnaround. We don’t want the same plight of these other states.”
Cuomo sounded the alarm after a weekend’s worth of videos and reports of people violating social-distancing rules, including on Friday in Manhattan’s East Village, a neighborhood with many bars and restaurants, and on Saturday in Hell’s Kitchen, where gay pride celebrations were underway.
The governor singled out bar owners and patrons in Manhattan and the Hamptons on Long Island for flouting the rules, and he warned that if local officials did not crack down on such behavior, the state authorities might suspend or roll back reopening plans for those areas.
Such a move could be financially devastating for business owners who were forced to close for most or all of New York’s almost three-month shutdown, and for the tentative recovery in the city, where municipal coffers were decimated as nearly 1 million people lost jobs.
“There is a very real possibility that we would roll back the reopening in those areas,” Cuomo said Sunday, suggesting that a second wave of infections was almost inevitable if people gathering outside bars and others violated rules. “It will come. And once it comes, it’s too late.”
Cuomo’s warning came as state officials touted the minuscule rate of new positive virus cases in New York — just over 1% of more than 56,000 tests conducted on Sunday, according to the governor — and as other states grappled with surges in infections.
The number of virus cases has been rising in many of the states that reopened earlier, and in a broader fashion, than New York: Arizona, Florida and Texas all recently reported their highest numbers of cases yet. The governors of Oregon and Utah have taken the drastic step of pausing reopenings in their states as a result of similar spikes.
Without a vaccine for the virus, experts have warned, about 70% of the population will need to be infected and develop immunity to halt the spread of infection. New York has had about 390,000 confirmed cases, or about 2% of the state’s population.
As of Monday, about 1,600 people in the state were hospitalized because of the virus, the fewest since March 20 and a huge decline from a peak of over 18,000. The daily death toll has hovered below 50 for the past five days, compared with the nearly 800 in one day that were recorded at the outbreak’s peak.
But health officials have cautioned that the number of cases could rise as businesses fully reopen, people return to work and commuters take mass transit again, especially in New York City, which has tallied more than 20,000 virus-related deaths. The city began a limited reopening on June 8 that allowed construction and manufacturing to resume, while also permitting curbside and in-store pickup for retail businesses.
Another concern is the recent mass protests against police brutality that have, at times, clogged the city’s streets with tens of thousands of people. Although they have encouraged participants to wear masks, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cuomo have fretted about the possibility the protests could fuel the virus’ spread.
There have also been conflicting messages from the state leaders about social gatherings. Such gatherings are still technically limited to 10 people, although Cuomo said Monday that the New York regions in the third phase of reopening — most of the state from the Hudson River to Lake Erie — could allow gatherings of up to 25 people.
The mixed messages on gatherings, along with a weekend of warm weather, may have contributed to a false sense of security among those who were seen flouting social-distancing guidelines.
On Sunday, Cuomo said that the state had been deluged with around 25,000 complaints about businesses that were “in violation of the reopening plan.” He warned that bars and restaurants could lose their liquor licenses if they failed to comply, noted that state Liquor Authority inspectors had been dispatched to problem areas and said that he had called several establishments himself.
But he emphasized it was ultimately up to local governments to enforce the state’s reopening policies, and he publicly urged mayors and county executives to target establishments that were found to be flouting rules.
“They don’t want to enforce them because they’re not popular,” Cuomo said Monday. “Nobody wants to go to a bar and say, ‘You guys have to wear a mask. You guys are violating social distancing.’ I get it, but they have to do their job.”
A spokeswoman for de Blasio, the governor’s fellow Democrat and frequent rival, took issue with Cuomo’s remarks, saying in a statement that city employees had worked over the weekend to disperse large groups, distribute face coverings and help business owners keep patrons at an appropriate distance from one another.
“We must balance safety with people’s need to reopen their businesses,” the statement said. “These businesses are allowed to be open per the governor’s guidelines, and we don’t believe imprisoning people or taking away their livelihood is the answer.”
Monday was also the start of the second stage of New Jersey’s reopening. Across the state, outdoor dining was allowed to resume with restrictions, and retail businesses opened their doors for limited indoor shopping for the first time in months.
“Our goal is to not experience the spikes that other states are now seeing because they rushed to open too much, too soon,” Gov. Philip D. Murphy said. “We have lost too many lives in too short a period to not heed the lessons of this virus.”
Not every public official was pleading for caution.
Steven McLaughlin, the Republican county executive of Rensselaer County, New York, just east of Albany, has been encouraging local businesses to fully reopen against state’s guidelines, saying that county officials would not enforce the restrictions.
McLaughlin has criticized the governor’s shutdown as unnecessary, arguing that was hurting small businesses despite there being few active cases in the county. McLaughlin has also derided the governor, whom he has called ‘King Cuomo,’ for threatening to fine businesses while encouraging people to participate in protests.
“Ignore him and his stupid ‘phases,’” McLaughlin wrote of the governor on Twitter last week. “Every day he proves they are arbitrary and based on nothing but his maniacal need for power.”

NEW YORK — The New York police commissioner announced on Monday that he was disbanding the Police Department’s anti-crime unit, a plainclothes team of hundreds of officers who targeted violent crime and have been involved in some of the city’s most notorious police shootings.
“This is 21st-century policing,” the commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, said at a news conference Monday afternoon. “We must do it in a manner that builds trust between the officers and the community they serve.”
Roughly 600 officers served in the plainclothes units, which are spread out across the city and work out of the department’s 77 precincts. The units would immediately be reassigned to other duties, Shea said, including the detective bureau and the department’s neighborhood policing initiative.
The unexpected announcement came after weeks of protests and public unrest over police brutality after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a black man who was killed when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Shea have been under pressure from protesters to reduce the size of the police department and shift resources into social programs. The City Council speaker has proposed slashing the Police Department’s $6 billion budget by $1 billion.

Killing in Atlanta Refocuses Attention on Police Use of Force: [National Desk]

Full text: The continuing deaths of black people by the police are undermining support for the wide latitude officers are given in cases in which an encounter ends in a death.
ATLANTA -- The swift decision on Sunday to fire the white Atlanta police officer who shot and killed a black motorist intensified the growing re-examination of the use of deadly force by the police, challenging longstanding principles that have given law enforcement officers wide latitude in cases in which an encounter ends with a death.
Although laws vary by state, police officers in America are generally allowed to use deadly force when they reasonably believe their lives or the lives of others are in danger, a legal standard designed to give the authorities enormous leeway to make split-second life-or-death decisions without hesitation or fear of prosecution.
But in the wake of years of growing anger over the deaths of African-Americans by the police, and particularly the nationwide upheaval following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, those guiding principles are now falling away with astonishing rapidity, police and legal experts say.
"In the last two weeks, I have seen more legislators -- federal and state legislators -- talking about amending use of force laws, and I've seen more laws proposed than I've ever seen before," said Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies policing and use-of-force policies. "There is a much broader bipartisan recognition that the status quo is untenable and something needs to change."
Within 24 hours of the shooting death in Atlanta of Rayshard Brooks, which took place near a Wendy's drive-through, the city's police chief resigned and the officer who fired the fatal shot was terminated.
According to video captured by surveillance cameras and bystanders in the drive-through, Mr. Brooks struggled with two police officers before taking one of the officer's Tasers. An officer then shot him as he fled. On Sunday, the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office ruled that Mr. Brooks's death was a homicide and said he had been shot twice in the back, causing "organ injuries and blood loss."
Also on Sunday, police released additional video showing that Mr. Brooks and the two officers spoke calmly for more than 25 minutes before the altercation.
As those details emerged, lawmakers and leaders drew parallels -- and contrasts -- with the other recent police-involved killings of black people that have ignited protests across the nation.
"We need reformation of how police officers do their jobs, how law enforcement does its job because what happened yesterday to Rayshard Brooks was a function of excessive force," Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic candidate for Georgia governor in 2018, said on ABC's "This Week."
Over the last few years, a number of states have begun re-evaluating their use-of-force laws, particularly in the years since the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014, which stirred unrest there and set off a broader debate about race and law enforcement.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 16 states enacted new laws regarding use of force from 2014 to 2017. One 2014 law in Utah restricted officers to "use only that force which is reasonable and necessary" for executing a warrant. And nine states in that time period changed the law to provide more transparency in investigations of deaths involving police.
Georgia law states that officers may use deadly force if they "reasonably believe" a felony suspect has a deadly weapon, poses an immediate threat of physical violence, or if they have probable cause to believe that the person has committed a crime that involves serious physical harm, or the threat of such harm.
For Gerald Griggs, a lawyer and first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., the law tends to benefit the police. "If anything, the rules are bent toward law enforcement, and that's a special interest," Mr. Griggs said Sunday. "The police unions are the ones that are voicing support for that. And I think the community is beginning to see it's the voice of a very small few that are driving this opposition to police reform."
The shooting death of Mr. Brooks happened while the relationships among Atlanta politicians, rank-and-file officers and activists were already especially tense.
It took place less than three weeks after Mr. Floyd's killing unleashed a torrent of protests across the nation against police brutality. Those protests included Atlanta, where demonstrations escalated into a violent confrontation in which crowds smashed through downtown businesses and set police vehicles on fire. In one fraught episode caught on video involving two African-American college students, police officers pulled a woman from a car and tased a man as he sat in the driver's seat, leading to the termination of those officers, who also were charged with using excessive force.
On Saturday night, the city's mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said she did not believe that the shooting death of Mr. Brooks was "a justified use of deadly force," and said the officer, Garrett Rolfe, should be terminated immediately.
The swift response, which also included the resignation of the city's police chief, Erika Shields, reflected the intensified scrutiny now being applied to officers after using fatal force.
"I think people are fed up," said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, adding that the shift has been fueled in large part by the prevalence of video evidence that often provides a clear account of officers' using force beyond their word alone. "We're starting to see a lot more evidence that is either going to allow the officers the justification to do what they did or condemn and sometimes convict them."
Advocates for the police argue that officers are now being left to navigate a difficult landscape, believing they do not have the support of elected officials when responding to dangerous situations. "It doesn't matter if we're right or wrong," said Vincent Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.
The shift in political winds since Mr. Floyd's death in police custody has emboldened efforts at overhauling laws and policies surrounding policing that activists have pushed for years but found to be intractable.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed an expansive package of bills on Friday that barred the use of chokeholds and also repealed a statute in the civil code, known as 50-a, that shielded police officers' disciplinary records from being released to the public.
Activists had targeted the code for years, particularly after Eric Garner died after a police officer in New York placed him in a chokehold in 2014, but their efforts had little success as they collided with powerful opposition, including from police unions.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for an immediate end to the use of "strangleholds" last week, saying such use of force had "no place any longer in 21st century practices and policing."
In Washington, D.C., the City Council passed a new use of force provision last week in emergency legislation that will be valid for 90 days, but could eventually become permanent. It stipulates that a jury, in a criminal case against a police officer, must not only focus on whether the officer had a "belief" that the use of force was reasonable -- a common standard in state law -- but also find that an officer's actions were reasonable.
This focus on "reasonable actions" is a seemingly small but potentially important shift in the goal posts in criminal use-of-force cases that was inspired by Cynthia Lee, a George Washington University law professor, who laid out the idea in a 2018 law review article.
The Washington law also requires juries to consider whether an officer engaged in de-escalation measures, and whether the officer's preceding conduct increased the risk of a deadly confrontation.
"Even though law reform may not provide all the answers, it can help shift the culture," Professor Lee said in an interview Sunday. "We want officers to be more careful when they're in these tense situations and we want them to see people as human beings instead of enemies."
In Atlanta, the police said they were called on Friday night to a Wendy's where Mr. Brooks had fallen asleep inside his car while in the drive-through. Mr. Rolfe and another officer, Devin Brosnan, tried to take Mr. Brooks into custody after he failed a sobriety test, the police said.
Video filmed by witnesses shows Mr. Brooks wrestling with the officers, taking Officer Brosnan's Taser and punching Mr. Rolfe, according to a New York Times visual investigation of the footage. Mr. Rolfe fired his Taser gun. The darts hit Mr. Brooks, and Mr. Rolfe continued trying to stun him. Mr. Brooks ran away, holding Officer Brosnan's Taser gun. Mr. Rolfe gave chase, and continued to try to stun Mr. Brooks.
Mr. Rolfe fired his weapon three times at Mr. Brooks as he ran away. Mr. Brooks was taken to a hospital where he died, officials said.
Mr. Rolfe was fired over the shooting, officials said, and Officer Brosnan was placed on administrative duty.
Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting from Minneapolis, and Rebecca Halleck from New York.

The killing of George Floyd and the ensuing nationwide wave of protests are generating a record-setting flood of donations to racial justice groups, bail funds and black-led advocacy organizations across America, remaking the financial landscape of black political activism in a matter of weeks.
Money has come in so fast and so unexpectedly that some groups even began to turn away and redirect donors elsewhere. Others said they could not yet account for how much had arrived. A deluge of online donations has washed over organizations big and small — from legacy civil rights groups to self-declared abolitionists seeking to defund the police.
Black leaders and activists said it was a landmark moment in which a multiracial coalition protesting systemic racism and police brutality not only marched together, showed solidarity on social media and drove books about racism up the best-seller charts but also opened their wallets — especially during a pandemic that has driven 40 million people from their jobs and created one of the sharpest economic downturns in U.S. history.
“To see millions of people give millions of dollars creates hope out of this moment,” said Glynda C. Carr, president of Higher Heights, a group dedicated to building the political power of black women and which saw a spike of 15,000 donations in two weeks — about 10 times more than usual. “In the end, not everybody went out and protested,” she said. “This was a way to participate.”
ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic causes and campaigns, has experienced its busiest period since its founding in 2004, far surpassing even the highest peaks of the 2020 presidential primary season. (ActBlue confirmed that racial justice causes and bail funds had led the way.) The site’s four biggest days came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250 million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus weeks, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation ticker.
And on June 2, the collective action day that was known as Blackout Tuesday, ActBlue doubled what had been, before this month, its one-day record: raising $41 million in 24 hours.
“Is it a moment or is it a movement? I’m feeling like it’s a movement,” said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League. “It’s organic and spontaneous and global.”
At the forefront of the giving wave were bail funds, as millions of Americans spontaneously gave money to ensure that any protesters who were arrested in clashes with police got out of jail quickly. Leaders of two national networks said bail funds had received a combined $90 million over two weeks — an astonishingly large sum for a cause that had operated at the periphery of politics only recently.
Some of the leading black and racial justice groups declined to comment on the scope of their windfalls, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter Global Network, whose name became a national rallying cry.
“This is a watershed moment for all black-led organizing groups,” said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, who did reveal that one of her group’s online petitions alone had raised $5 million. “It is the moment when our allies and individuals have joined our call for justice.” It is also, she added, a time of “mixed emotions,” after the killing of Floyd and other black Americans that had “brought people around the globe to their knees.”
Another person familiar with the group’s fundraising said that it had raised $10 million just on Blackout Tuesday; Scales declined to comment on that figure.
Few expect the largess to last. As the protesters recede, so too will the donations, leaders predicted. But group after group has a far larger base of supporters to draw upon for donations going forward. Several black leaders brushed aside concerns that the sudden influx of funds might be squandered, especially by undersized groups suddenly flush with cash, because the needs are so big.
“Black-led nonprofits and civil rights nonprofits — we’re all stretched against the world we’re supposed to fix and the issues we’ve been involved in and sometimes the people we’re up against,” Morial said.
Color of Change, which had promoted itself as the largest online racial justice group in the country, quadrupled its membership from 1.7 million to 7 million people in recent days.
Rashad Robinson, Color of Change’s president, said the group had received “hundreds of thousands of individual donations” — far more than any previous period — and called it a “rallying cry for us to grow and continue the work.”
Despite a policy of not taking corporate donations, so much unsolicited corporate money poured into Color of Change’s accounts in recent days that the group’s board is still trying to tally up the totals. The board has created what it calls an Emergency Fund for Racial Justice to redistribute those corporate donations, in partnership with the Amalgamated Foundation, to other black-led groups.
But as rubber bullets flew and images of tear gas-filled police clashes played out nightly on cable news, nothing became the progressive cause du jour quite like bail funds.
Pilar Weiss, director of the National Bail Fund Network, an umbrella group that links together independent community bail funds, said millions of people had donated an estimated $75 million to her network’s funds in the last two weeks. Robin Steinberg, chief executive of a different national group, The Bail Project, said the organization had received an additional $15 million.
Sharlyn Grace, executive director of the Chicago Community Bond Fund, said, “The support we’ve received is not really about us as a bail fund but support for the Black Lives Matter movement and support for protesters who are taking the streets forcing this national reckoning.”
The outpouring has been organic, viral and immense.
In New York City, a bail fund in Brooklyn received $1.8 million from 50,000 contributors — in only 24 hours — before asking donors to give elsewhere. In Philadelphia, the bail fund hauled in $2.4 million. And in Los Angeles, one GoFundMe page for the local chapter of Black Lives Matter zoomed past $2 million raised, and another for a previously undersized group, the People’s City Council, leapt from $1,500 raised to $2.3 million.
Crowdsourced memorial funds for the families of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, who was gunned down this year in Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police inside her home in Louisville, Kentucky, have amassed more than $23 million. The Floyd memorial broke GoFundMe’s record for most contributions, with nearly 500,000.
Some of the most intense giving has been to groups in Minnesota, where Floyd was killed and where the protests began. One neighborhood rebuilding project quickly raised $6.2 million from 62,000 contributors. Another group, Women for Political Change, that supports younger women and transgender individuals, netted $219,000 from a GoFundMe page.
Reclaim the Block, which wants to defund the police, did not previously have an office or paid staff, according to Tony Williams, a member of the group. He said the group raised at least $1 million in recent days, though he did not know the exact sum.
“I’m reasonably sure it’s in the single-digit millions because if it passed $10 million I think someone would have said, ‘Holy heck!’” he said. “It’s a sign of the complete transformation that’s happening in the national dialogue right now.”
The Minnesota Freedom Fund, a cash bail fund, raised a stunning $20 million in four days at the end of May before redirecting donors elsewhere (including to Reclaim the Block). Another $10 million came in anyway — from nearly 1 million individuals, according to the group’s volunteer treasurer, Steve Boland.
The $30 million total haul is nearly 300 times what it raised in its previous full year’s tax filing.
For some perspective on just how many donors that is, it took Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s grassroots-funded presidential campaign more than 13 months to reach the million-donor milestone. The presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden, has a total of 1.6 million unique contributors almost 14 months into his candidacy, according to his campaign.
Biden, too, has seen a significant spike in fundraising of late as he invested $5 million into Facebook ads in the first week of June — spending more in a few days than he did in the first 10 months of his campaign, a sign of how much donors were responding. More than 1.2 million people joined his email list in a week.
There is some precedent for massive giving at cultural inflection points. In mid-2018, as the Trump administration was separating families at the border, a single Facebook fundraiser for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services in Texas went viral, raising $20 million in a few days.
But that was one fundraiser and one group, not the vast array of organizations that have experienced recent windfalls, including the activists and advocates as well as some of the journalism outlets that cover them.
One tiny group in Chicago, Equity and Transformation, which serves black people left behind in the economy, saw a dormant GoFundMe page go freshly viral, raising $44,000. “We’ve never had that kind of resources,” Richard Wallace, the founder, said.
Unicorn Riot, an alternative media company that closely covered the early Minneapolis protests, blew past an initial $5,000 online fundraising goal by a factor of 100, raising $570,000, according to the site’s online tracker. And The Marshall Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit news organization that reports on the criminal justice system, saw its membership double, from 4,000 to 9,500, according to Carroll Bogert, the group’s president.
“We’re just sitting here doing our jobs and donations started skyrocketing,” she said.
The energy to contribute is so vast that even those without money have sought ways to contribute, including watching videos on YouTube that promise to direct every dollar of revenue to racial justice causes.
“I wish I could give money — I can’t, I’m broke,” said Zoe Amira, a 20-year-old who lives outside Chicago and posted an ad-laden video that was viewed more than 9 million times, generating $42,000 — before it was yanked for violating ad policies. She later said on Twitter that YouTube told her it would make a donation of an equal size because it “so believed in the essence of the project.”
Celebrities — Chrissy Teigen, Lady Gaga, Leonardo DiCaprio, among others — have joined and amplified the giving, too. One pop singer, Abel Tesfaye, known as The Weeknd, posted receipts for $500,000 in donations. And the K-pop boy band BTS announced giving $1 million to Black Lives Matter; its fan group matched that by donating $1.3 million to a dozen advocacy groups.
Big corporations are making major pledges: $100 million each from Warner Music Group, Comcast and the Sony Music Group for various social justice causes, among many companies.
Small donors are powering the moment. Aidan King, an unemployed Democratic digital strategist, created a portal on ActBlue to allow people to simultaneously donate to dozens of bail funds and other racial justice groups. That single page has processed $16.5 million from more than 215,000 individuals in two weeks.
“It’s this horribly tragic and heartbreaking but also, in a way, beautifully perfect storm for activism and solidarity,” King said.
Carr, the leader of Higher Heights, said she saw many white friends and colleagues in her own network giving to black-led groups for the first time.
“People,” she said, “are being inspired by the moment.”

Full text: A variety of events have gone digital this year -- and they're joined by the marquee Global Pride livestream.
If you're feeling conflicted about how to celebrate Pride this year, you're hardly alone. Three months after the coronavirus pandemic turned the world on its head, America has been rocked by coast-to-coast protests inspired by George Floyd, whose death has led millions to cry out for an end to police brutality -- and an end to police departments generally.
But Pride organizers have adapted (shoe box parade floats, anyone?), and with no shortage of virtual events, many of which have been reoriented to amplify black voices and concerns, it's possible to be not just safe but supportive while still showing your pride.
Learn together.
Within weeks, the George Floyd demonstrations upended a Pride month that was already poised to be unlike any other. Although many planned events were called off in deference, others were reconfigured to put the focus on black L.G.B.T.Q. people.
In New York, a virtual drag fest scheduled to feature more than 100 drag queens was replaced with a three-day Black Queer Town Hall (June 19-21). The event, to be hosted by Peppermint, a transgender actress who starred in the Broadway jukebox musical "Head Over Heels," and Bob the Drag Queen, a past winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race," will feature round-table discussions on dismantling racism and white supremacy as well as performances by black New York City drag queens. (Keep in mind: Venmo tips are the new crinkly bills.) Marti Gould Cummings, a fixture of the city's drag scene and a candidate for City Council, will help lead the festivities, which will also carve out time to pay tribute to black pioneers of the gay rights movement. All programming will be streamed on GLAAD's and NYC Pride's YouTube pages.
As its parent company, Condé Nast, faces a reckoning over its treatment of people of color, Them, the publisher's fledgling publication dedicated to L.G.B.T.Q. style, culture, politics and issues, will host a virtual Pride event on June 22 called Out Now Live that is heavy on boldface names. Cynthia Nixon, Hayley Kiyoko, Zac Posen, Lee Daniels, Billy Eichner, Naomi Campbell, Elton John, Indya Moore, Judith Light and Tegan and Sara are all expected to appear in the event, which will include speeches, personal stories of L.G.B.T.Q. activism since the 1970s and performances by King Princess and Princess Nokia.
And with plenty of time to spend at home, there may be no better time to catch up on or revisit queer classics. This month New York Public Library branches will host online book discussions of titles including Oscar Wilde's "The Picture of Dorian Gray" (June 17, 2 p.m.) and Leslie Feinberg's "Stone Butch Blues" (June 24, 6 p.m.), which is available to read on the author's website.
Rally together.
Last summer, 50 years after the Stonewall uprising, New York City was the center of the world's Pride celebrations. But the city's first gay pride march wasn't held until 1970, a year after Stonewall, making 2020 another meaningful milestone for New York in the struggle for gay rights.
Instead of a physical march through Manhattan's broad avenues and narrow side streets, NYC Pride will observe the 50th anniversary with a broadcast wending its way through the history of the L.G.B.T.Q. movement. The two-hour event (June 28, noon) will feature grand marshals including the transgender activist Victoria Cruz and Dan Levy, a creator and star of "Schitt's Creek," as well as performances by Janelle Monáe, Deborah Cox and Billy Porter. Carson Kressley -- perhaps a more familiar sight flanking RuPaul as a judge on "Drag Race" -- will co-host the special, which will be broadcast on WABC and stream on the station's website.
But before settling into a more celebratory mood, the main weekend of New York Pride will begin with an online rally (June 26, 5 p.m.) seeking to capture the defiant spirit of the 1969 "Gay Power" demonstrations one month after the Stonewall uprising. Ashlee Marie Preston, a transgender writer and political activist, and Brian Michael Smith, a transgender actor, will host the event, which -- in addition to sounding the call for L.G.B.T.Q. rights and human rights generally -- will loudly condemn police brutality and discrimination.
When the pandemic began to pour cold water on plans for Pride celebrations around the world, L.G.B.T.Q. groups at every level -- local, regional, even continental -- pooled their organizational muscle to coordinate Global Pride, an ambitious 24-hour streaming event on YouTube (June 27). In addition to remarks from former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Speaker Nancy Pelosi, prime ministers and royalty, the event will showcase talent from across the globe: Pabllo Vittar, the Brazilian drag performer; Olivia Newton-John, the Australian pop icon; and American singers including Thelma Houston, Ava Max, Rita Ora, Steve Grand, Kesha and the Pussycat Dolls. Global Pride organizers have said they intend to use the event to amplify black voices, in part by working with founders of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Meanwhile, Dan Savage's It Gets Better Project will do its best to build you up as you hunker down with a three-day livestream event (June 24-26) drawing on YouTube royalty like Rebecca Black and Louie Castro as well as the "RuPaul's Drag Race" alumni Crystal Methyd and Jujubee. With musicians, actors and online beauty experts, the event hopes to be a dose of positivity amid the pandemic.
Dance together.
At the very first whiff of stay-at-home orders, D.J.s looking to keep the party going flocked to Zoom and Instagram Live. In a Pride month unlike any other, many of the same people who would ordinarily be responsible for supplying parades, marches, street festivals and dance clubs with thumping beats are now keeping us moving at home (or at least giving the less dance-inclined a taste of the music they miss).
Cincinnati Black Pride found the silver lining in the pandemic, noting on its website that the lockdown "offers some of our favorite D.J.s in Cincinnati a unique opportunity to virtually be in multiple places over the Pride weekend at the same time." D.J. Kaotic, a Cincinnati native, leads off four nights of "grown and sexy" D.J.s with her set on June 25 -- after the city's Black Alphabet Film Festival. The rest of the weekend will include classics, Caribbean, jazz, spiritual house and a Sunday tea dance.
Amid Pride Toronto's robust schedule of virtual programming, there are a few standouts. Before the city's third and final Stay Home Saturday (June 20, 2 p.m.), be sure to tune in to the Link Up on June 18 (4 p.m.), when the Toronto D.J.s Soulsis and Razaq El Toro will bring soca, dancehall and Afro beats -- so long as you supply the bass and an appropriately vibey Summer of Quarantine outfit.
Beloved New York City spots are also doing their best to deliver Pride straight to you. House of Yes, the free-spirited Brooklyn dance club, will host a digital dance party for Pride (June 27, 8 p.m.) in collaboration with Glitterbox, whose high-energy "virtual festivals" have given a jolt to quarantine nightlife for millions streaming worldwide. The Greenwich Village piano bar Marie's Crisis is continuing to share show tunes from its pianists' living rooms on Facebook Live. And Ty Sunderland, the promoter behind popular parties like Heaven on Earth, has been flirting with the idea of a digital version of his pop-music rave Devil's Playground (June 26, 10 p.m.) for months now.

Here to Help; Talking to Kids About Racism: [briefing]

Full text: A school counselor and a children's book author offer advice for talking to children about racism and George Floyd.
Good morning.
(Here's the sign-up , if you don't already get California Today by email.)
The protests in response to the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor have elicited questions from children of all ages, and many parents are left wondering how to respond.
Children are like sponges. They soak up news headlines and images of unrest on TV and social media. They may also be keenly attuned to conversations about current events happening at home. Parents and educators alike (and those of us now wearing both hats) should address questions about racism that arise and maintain an open dialogue with children.
To help navigate the best way to do this, I asked Christiana Cobb-Dozier, a school counselor in Los Angeles, and Christian Robinson, a Sacramento-based author and illustrator of children's books, about how to talk to children about racism.
Here's what they said:
1) All parents should talk to their children about racism. "We don't talk about race and disparities and inequity enough," said Ms. Cobb-Dozier. Too often, the burden of talking about race falls to the parents of black children.
Mr. Robinson, who grew up in Los Angeles, said that as a black child, race was always talked about in his family. "I wouldn't even call it a topic of discussion, it was just discussion," he said.
"We should all be having conversations with our children that the color of your skin in this country, specifically, will dictate your experiences in the world," Ms. Cobb-Dozier said.
There are ways to broach the topic of race with children at every developmental level, even with kids as young as 2. It's important to follow their lead. If children approach their parents ready to talk about race, it's a good sign that they are ready to talk about it. "If they're asking about it, they're ready to know about it," Ms. Cobb-Dozier said.
2) Be honest with yourself and with your children. When talking about racism, it's important for parents to also check their own thoughts for biases, unconscious or not.
One way of rooting out unconscious biases, Mr. Robinson said, is to use the power of imagination, an idea he heard while giving a talk with the founders of Abundant Beginnings, a school in Oakland.
"Imagine that for some people, there's a fairy that lands on your shoulder. And that fairy is called racism," he said. "And it will say something from time to time in your ear, like, 'Don't trust that person,' 'You should cross the street,' 'You should be afraid.' You got to recognize these things as thoughts. And I think that's a good practice for young people to be working on."
3) Have diverse books around for children to read. Ms. Cobb-Dozier, who is black, talked about the experience of having two black godchildren. She said, "I'm constantly sending them affirmation coloring books or poems that will remind them as they are growing up about the beauty of who they are and the resiliency of their people."
She recommends the following books: "Black Is a Rainbow Color," "Last Stop on Market Street," "Each Kindness" and "Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You."
[ These books can also help explain racism and protest to your kids .]
4) Allow for questions even when you don't know the answers. You may not have the answers to questions like, "Why is this happening?," but it's important to hold space for them and explain how you feel, nonetheless.
"Brace yourself. Be ready for their response and just be with them," Ms. Cobb-Dozier said. "If they're crying, hold them and tell them you're sad, too."
Every Sunday on Instagram and YouTube, Mr. Robinson posts a new "Making Space" video, a personal project he started during the pandemic as an outlet for creativity. Each episode features a theme with the most recent one being anger. It's his way of encouraging creativity in children, too. "Creativity was the thing that got me through a lot of hardships and helped me process the world around me," he said. "Children may not have much control over the world around them, but they can have some say over the world they create on the page with their imaginations."
5) If speaking with black children, let them know their lives matter and encourage their whole identity.
The message of Mr. Robinson's latest book, "You Matter," is one his grandmother, who raised Mr. Robinson, his older brother and two cousins in a one-bedroom home, instilled in him from an early age. Drawing became a way for him to make space for himself and to create the kind of world he wanted to see.

This was supposed to be Condé Nast’s year.
The publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker was going to be profitable again after years of layoffs and losses.
Then advertising revenue suddenly dropped as the coronavirus pandemic cratered the economy. More recently, as protests against racism and police violence grew into a worldwide movement, company employees publicly complained about racism in the workplace and in some Condé Nast content.
In response, the two leaders of the nearly all-white executive team — the artistic director, Anna Wintour, and the chief executive, Roger Lynch — offered apologies to the staff.
At an all-hands online meeting Friday, employees asked if Wintour, the top editor of Vogue since 1988 and the company’s editorial leader since 2013, would be leaving. Lynch and the communications chief, Danielle Carrig, shot down the question, saying Wintour was not going anywhere, said three people who attended the meeting but were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
Tumult has hit Condé Nast, a company built partly on selling a glossy brand of elitism to the masses, at a time when its financial outlook is grim. Last year, the U.S. division lost approximately $100 million on about $900 million in revenue, said several people with knowledge of the company, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The European arm also had losses.
Lynch said in an interview Friday that he was “not familiar” with the cited figures, adding that the company’s merger of its domestic and international operations, part of a recent restructuring, had been costly.
In April, the company instituted pay cuts for anyone making over $100,000. Then came layoffs — 100 jobs gone out of roughly 6,000.
Condé Nast is one of many media organizations, including The New York Times, whose employees have questioned company leaders as people around the world have taken part in protests prompted by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died last month in Minneapolis after a white police officer pinned him to the ground.
The company has been led by the Newhouse family since 1959. Steven Newhouse heads the parent company, Advance, and his cousin Jonathan Newhouse is chairman of Condé Nast’s board. Advance also controls more than 40 newspapers and news sites across the country. Many of them, including The Plain Dealer of Cleveland and The Star-Ledger in Newark, have struggled. The Newhouse family has protected itself against losses with significant investments in cable giant Charter and the media conglomerate Discovery.
Before the internet took readers away from print, Condé Nast was known for thick magazines edited by cultural arbiters who traveled in the same circles as the people they covered. As digital media rose, Condé Nast was slow to adapt. Budgets tightened. Magazines including Gourmet, Mademoiselle and Details folded.
By the time Lynch, a former head of the music streaming service Pandora, succeeded Robert Sauerberg as the chief executive last year, Condé Nast was in triage mode. After his arrival, it unloaded three publications: Brides, Golf Digest and W.
On Monday, Condé Nast reckoned with how the company deals with issues related to race. Adam Rapoport, the longtime top editor of Bon Appétit, resigned after a photo surfaced on social media showing him in a costume that stereotypically depicted Puerto Rican dress.
He apologized to staff members in a videoconference. After Rapoport left the call, the staff voiced complaints about the Bon Appétit workplace. Some minority employees said they had been used as ethnic props in Bon Appétit’s videos, a growing segment of the Condé Nast business.
“It’s so hard to be a person of color at this company,” said Ryan Walker-Hartshorn, a black woman who worked as an assistant to Rapoport. “My blood is still boiling.”
She recalled a 2018 meeting of editors to discuss how to make the magazine’s Instagram account more diverse. In a room of about eight editors, three were people of color.
“And we’re all very junior, no power,” Walker-Hartshorn said in an interview. “I was like, ‘You’re asking us how to make our Instagram black without hiring more black people?’”
At a company forum Tuesday, Lynch said Bon Appétit employees should have raised their concerns earlier, a comment that rubbed many the wrong way. In a closed-door session later that day, he apologized to a group of staff members who had pushed for Rapoport’s ouster.
“I want you to know I take this personally, and I take personal responsibility for it,” he said, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by The New York Times.
A onetime banker at Morgan Stanley, Lynch spent much of his career at Dish, the satellite TV service. As a hobby he played lead guitar in a classic-rock cover band, the Merger. He moved from San Francisco to New York and updated his wardrobe to join Condé Nast.
Lynch, 57, has emphasized diversity efforts and environmental programs in emails to the staff. He said in the interview Friday that he was developing an overall company strategy as he assembled his executive team. In December he hired Deirdre Findlay as the chief marketing officer, making her the company’s highest-ranking black executive.
His former executive assistant, Cassie Jones, who is black, quit shortly after he gave her a gift she considered insulting, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
In November, after she had spent four months working for him, Lynch called Jones into his office and handed her “The Elements of Style,” a guide to standard English usage by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White. Lynch said he thought she could benefit from it.
With its suggestion that her own language skills were lacking, the gift struck Jones as a microaggression, the people said. A few days later, she quit. Before leaving the headquarters at 1 World Trade in lower Manhattan, she placed the book on his desk.
Lynch said he hadn’t meant to insult Jones, who declined to comment for this article. “I really only had the intention — like every time I’ve given it before — for it to be a helpful resource, as it has been for me,” he said. “I still use it today. I’m really sorry if she interpreted it that way.”
Before Lynch’s arrival, David Remnick, the editor-in-chief of The New Yorker, objected to a plan that would have lowered the magazine’s subscription price and raised ad rates. He has brought aboard a diverse crew of journalists, including Jia Tolentino, Hua Hsu and Vinson Cunningham, while adding digital subscriptions.
Three people with knowledge of the company said The New Yorker was likely to surpass Vogue as Condé Nast’s biggest contributor to U.S. profits by the end of 2020. The people added that about 80% of The New Yorker’s revenue came from readers, which helped the magazine weather the advertising downturn. The magazine did not cut staff during the recent layoffs.
On June 4, Wintour sent an apologetic note to the Vogue staff. “I want to say this especially to the Black members of our team — I can only imagine what these days have been like,” Wintour wrote.
She added, “I want to say plainly that I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators. We have made mistakes, too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant. I take full responsibility for those mistakes.”
The British-born Wintour has been credited internally for championing Radhika Jones, one of few top editors of color in the company’s history.
Jones, the former editorial director of the book department at The Times who took over Vanity Fair from Graydon Carter in 2017, changed the magazine’s identity. The first cover subject she chose, for the April 2018 issue, was actress and producer Lena Waithe, a black woman photographed by Annie Leibovitz in a plain T-shirt. Later covers featured Michael B. Jordan, Janelle Monae and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Jones has put out 16 Vanity Fair covers featuring people of color.
When Jones arrived, she was pilloried by fashion insiders who questioned her style sense. Her choice of legwear — tights with illustrated foxes — drew stares, according to a report in Women’s Wear Daily. Wintour later showed her support for Jones at a welcome party by handing out gifts: tights with foxes on them.
At a quarterly meeting of company executives in April 2019, on Lynch’s second day at Condé Nast, Jones presented her plan for Vanity Fair’s fall issues, a prime landing spot for fashion and luxury advertisers. (From September to December last year, the Vanity Fair covers featured Kristen Stewart, Lupita Nyong’o, Joaquin Phoenix, and Chrissy Teigen, John Legend and their children.)
Two executives criticized Jones’ plan, according to three people who were at the meeting and were not authorized to discuss it publicly. In particular, Susan Plagemann, the chief business officer of Condé Nast’s style division, challenged Jones at length, saying the plan would be difficult to sell to advertisers. To defuse the tension, Wintour banged her fist on the table, saying, “We need to move on,” according to the three people who were at the meeting.
Plagemann, who is white, joined the company in 2010 as Vogue’s chief business officer and worked closely with Wintour; in 2018, she was elevated to her current job. Three people with knowledge of the matter said she was vocal about her negative view of Vanity Fair under its new editor.
She had criticized Jones’ choices of cover subjects, telling others at the company that the magazine should feature “more people who look like us,” two of the people said. A third person said he had heard her use words expressing a similar sentiment. All the people said they interpreted the phrase and similar remarks as referring to well-off white women who adopt an aesthetic common among the fashion set.
Through a Condé Nast spokesman, Plagemann denied making those statements and denied expressing a dim view of Jones’ Vanity Fair.
In the interview Friday, Lynch addressed Jones’ stewardship of the magazine more broadly. “The challenge with her taking that new direction would be alienating some of the traditional Vanity Fair audience,” he said. “I really applaud what she’s done.”
The uprising at Condé Nast was overdue, some staff members said. “We’ve been asking for change for months now,” Sohla El-Waylly, an assistant editor at Bon Appétit, said in an interview.
In the Tuesday meeting with Bon Appétit staff members, Lynch said he hoped to prove a commitment to diversity with the choice of Rapoport’s replacement. Later in the call, he suggested that some staff members wanted to hurt Bon Appétit financially to bring about change, a comment that irked some in the meeting.
“It felt infantilizing, as if we were teenagers rebelling,” said Jesse Sparks, an editorial assistant.
Lynch said in the interview that he had meant to underscore the urgency of the matter. “I wanted to make sure they understood the brand they worked so hard to build was actually being harmed, and I think I even apologized to them in that meeting,” he said.
A Bon Appétit personality, Claire Saffitz, has generated over 200 million views with “Gourmet Makes,” a show in which she makes homemade versions of Twinkies and other junk food. She represents a new kind of Condé Nast, one built on a kind of rough-cut authenticity, but her popularity has drawn attention to the problem of representation.
El-Waylly, who was a regular guest on the show, said her addition to “Gourmet Makes” had been cynically motivated. “They just want me there to play the part to make it look like they have people of color on staff,” she said.
She said she was not paid for her appearances, as her white counterparts were. Condé Nast disputed that and said El-Waylly’s salary covered her video appearances.
On Wednesday, the company’s head of video, Matt Duckor, stepped down. Several employees had accused him of bias. Many people at the company are rooting for more change.
“What’s crazy is what it took for this stuff to happen,” Walker-Hartshorn said. “It took George Floyd.”

NEW YORK — They are movement newbies.
Mostly in their 20s and 30s, emerging from different corners of New York City, they call this their personal turning point. No longer, they say, could they just post on Instagram, or just give money, or just vote. They needed to put their bodies on the street after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
So for roughly two weeks, they have protested. They have protested on bikes and skateboards. They have knelt. They have poured across the bridges, faced off with the police and gotten arrested, detained for hours in crowded precinct station houses. They come out and march again, in steamy heat and in downpours.
For many, it’s their first movement. It’s their chance to be a part of history, they say, and for some, a moment to examine who they are.
These young New Yorkers are part of a global generational revolt erupting at a time when strongman leaders have ascended around the world. Their peers were out on the streets in Hong Kong and India. Climate protests were led by schoolchildren worldwide last year.
In this country, too, there were young adults in the rank and file of Black Lives Matter since its inception in 2013. And in 2018, the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, spurred a surge of activism by teenagers for gun control.
The groups known as millennials and Generation Z are the United States’ largest and most racially diverse generations. According to opinion polls, they tend to be progressive, they are less likely that older Americans to think the United States is superior to other countries, and they embody a profound demographic shift: Among Americans in their 20s and 30s, about 40% are people of color, compared with about 25% of those older than 60.
Here’s why a few of those who are new to protesting have taken to the streets.
Xavier Martinez and James Luckey
“This is pretty much my life now,” Xavier Martinez, 21, said, fresh from a march in Manhattan and searching for another, in Brooklyn, on a night that the city was under curfew.
“I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror if I weren’t here,” his friend, James Luckey, 21, explained.
Luckey grew up on Staten Island. He was 17 when Eric Garner died in a police chokehold not far from where he lived. Martinez grew up in Queens. One of his relatives was a police officer. They met as students at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan.
On a recent Friday, they snaked through Downtown Brooklyn, past Park Slope and onto Eastern Parkway. Luckey had been protesting nearly every day for a week. The faces on the streets were becoming familiar.
“Hey, I remember you,” Luckey said to two young women who were walking in his direction along Eastern Parkway. “Is it still going on?”
They recognized him, too. They told him how much farther to walk to meet up with the night’s remaining protesters.
“Stay safe,” they said to each other. It’s the refrain of the streets now: “Stay safe.”
Neither Martinez or Luckey belong to an established organization. They follow no particular leader. There are many leaders, they say. Some are the bicyclists who whistle and clear the path for marchers. Others lead chants. Suddenly, in a crowd of hundreds, someone else will command the group to kneel in one of the busiest intersections in Brooklyn, bringing the streets to a startling near-silence.
“The first person who makes their presence known is the leader,” Martinez said.
Luckey was arrested last week and spent eight hours in police custody. He had taken a day off to recuperate and then headed out again.
He knows that people in the 1960s did this, too. “We’re doing all the things they were doing in the past,” Luckey said. “It’s different now because we do have a lot of allies.”
Belinda Stahl
Adopted from Peru by a white American family, Belinda Stahl, 29, grew up in Maine, one of the whitest states in the country. As a child, most of her friends were white — otherwise, she laughed, she wouldn’t have had any friends.
Stahl moved to New York City to attend art school. She left, then came back, and by the time the coronavirus hit, she was juggling a series of restaurant and retail jobs while working on her passion, fashion design.
Police violence was not a new discovery to her, she said. But two things jolted her this time: the brutality of Floyd’s death, and on top of that, the timing.
“We are down and out,” she said. “We are in a pandemic. We don’t know if we are going to have our jobs back. At a point when everyone is not OK — that you would still do this?”
Instagram brought her images of protests in Minneapolis and then New York. Stahl had been isolated in her apartment for more than two months. She worried about the virus, but there was no way, she said, she could stay home.
“It was this feeling of helplessness, like I’m not supposed to leave my house, but this is wrong, so wrong, and they’re going to get away with it unless there’s a huge group of people to draw attention to how wrong this is,” she said.
On the fourth night of the New York protests, she called a friend, and they headed to Barclays Center, epicenter of the demonstrators in Brooklyn. She carried a homemade placard: “THIS ENDS NOW.”
Stahl reached out to more friends in the days after. Some of them had been beaten by the police in those protests, she said, which only steeled her resolve.
“It’s even more unifying,” she said. “You are all unarmed against people in riot gear. You’re just standing there, and what do you have around you? You have people.”
Her 67-year-old mother, Stahl said, would join the protests, were it not for fear of the virus.
“The conversation we are having right now to break systemic racism has begun with our parents,” she said. “My focus has shifted to more actively focusing on those conversations.”
Quin Johnson
First came a text from a friend. People were protesting a block away, in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where she lived. Quin Johnson and her boyfriend made signs at home and started walking with the crowd.
“It kept going further and further into the city,” Johnson, 36, said. “I felt like walking was my duty. I could walk all day.”
That night, the demonstrators walked across the Manhattan Bridge and up to Union Square. What scared her most was the police tear-gassing the crowds.
Days later, on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, a police car drove through a crowd of protesters, scattering everyone toward the edge of the street. “The more people see what police departments are doing, the more people get revved up,” she said.
“There are days even when I’m tired, I feel I have to walk and be part of this movement.”
The only protest Johnson had ever joined before was one for climate action last year. She has voted since she was 18 and follows the news. She is keenly aware of the long history of police violence. But this is the first time she has been out, day after day, for something she believes in. Last weekend was her first time out past curfew. She was terrified, she said.
“I’m not an activist; It’s my first time speaking out,” she said. “We’ve all been drowsy or sleeping.”
David and Danielle Dacosta
David Dacosta, 32, immigrated from Jamaica. His wife, Danielle, 31, came from Trinidad. To be stopped by the police in those countries, they said, was to risk having to pay a bribe.
Police violence became part of their education about black life in the United States.
“My parents didn’t tell us what black parents tell their kids,” Danielle Dacosta said. The thought of having that talk with a child of her own one day terrifies her, she said.
“I felt like I was ignorant of what black Americans have been experiencing,” she said. “It’s been eye-opening for sure.”
They stood close to each other, on the fringe of a crowd of over 1,000 at Barclays Center one evening last week. Two women spread out a mat, knelt and prayed. A Muslim relief group handed out falafel sandwiches. The Dacostas, who live in Brooklyn, planned to head home well before curfew.
The video of Floyd’s death jolted them; they knew it was the latest of many. Being silent, they told each other, was no longer an option.
“This is the first time I’m out marching for something,” Danielle Dacosta said. “Something has to be done.”
David Dacosta added, “I’ve never really been political, per se. Seeing the violence right now, it’s too much. To be silent is to be complicit. I can’t do that anymore.”

Fox News removed photos accompanying its coverage of Seattle’s demonstrations from its website on Friday after acknowledging that one was a combination of several different images and a second photo was of a fiery scene in a different city.
On Seattle’s Capitol Hill, protesters of the police killing of George Floyd have claimed a series of city blocks, now known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The police there have boarded up their precinct and given protesters free rein in the area. In recent days, the zone has featured speeches, music and a screening of a film on the criminal justice system.
On Friday, Fox posted on its site a photo of a man armed with a rifle standing in front of the shattered glass of a storefront. The Seattle Times noted that it was a combination of several different photos from Getty Images taken over nearly two weeks.
Also on the website, Fox posted a nighttime photo of a burning storefront and car, accompanied by the headline “Crazy Town” and a list of articles on the unrest in Seattle. But that image was taken in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Fox removed both images after inquiries from The Seattle Times.
In an editor’s note now accompanying the articles, Fox said the now-deleted image was a “collage” that “did not clearly delineate between these images, and has since been replaced. In addition, a recent slideshow depicting scenes from Seattle mistakenly included a picture from Minneapolis. Fox News regrets these errors.”
The unrest in Seattle has become a focal point for conservative media outlets and for President Donald Trump. In a series of tweets, Trump has called on local officials to take action.
“Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle,” he said in one post last week. “Take back your city NOW,” Trump later wrote in a tweet directed at the city’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington.
As is common at other publications, The New York Times editorial standards prohibit adding or rearranging images in a photo, except for cropping extraneous portions.
In some sections, and in magazines, where photographs serve as an illustration of an idea or as, say, a demonstration of how a device works, they must be clearly labeled a photo illustration, according to New York Times guidelines.

On Monday, as swiftly as a 9-iron taken to a tee at Augusta, Adam Rapoport resigned as the editor-in-chief of Bon Appétit magazine after a damning Halloween photo circulated on social media that morning. Drawn from the vast insensitivity archives to which so many influential people have made inadvertent submissions, the picture, from 2004, shows him costumed in a tank top and thick chain necklace as his wife’s “papi,” the term she attached to it in an Instagram post several years later.
As it happened, Rapoport had been facing mounting grievance from his staff about the magazine’s demeaning treatment of employees and freelancers of color and the dubious ways in which its popular video division presented culturally appropriated cooking. But these apparently were insufficient grounds for forcing him out.
Over and over, power structures seem to require that accusations of racial bias are documented by photographic evidence — proof to override a reflexive or simply inconvenient skepticism. Police officers abused their authority for decades without consequence. It was not until a growing body of video footage revealed all the brutality, and the systemic prejudice at the heart of it, that the world began to express the outrage there to be mined all along — justice by iPhone.
In that sense, Rapoport’s ouster at the hands of a camera was entirely fitting. Bon Appétit belongs to Conde Nast, a media empire perhaps unrivaled by any institution on earth in its supplication to image. For decades, both at the level of corporate culture and branded worldview, the company’s lifestyle magazines have held to the notion that there are “right” people and wrong people, a determination made by birthright. There are the rich, and there are the dismissible; the great looking and the condemned — a paradigm that has now become dangerously untenable, and one the company has been striving to change.
Within the Conde Nast framework, autocratic bosses were left to do whatever they pleased — subjugating underlings to hazing rituals with no seeming end point. So much was excusable in the name of beauty and profit. “Difficulty,” Kim France, a former editor-in-chief of Lucky magazine, told me, “was regarded as brilliance.”
No one at Conde Nast has had more of an outsize reputation for imperiousness wed to native talent than Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, the artistic director of the company and more recently its “global content adviser” as well. Rapoport, who spent 20 years at the company and turned around an ailing product in Bon Appétit, reported to her.
What sort of management cues were to be taken? Famous for a self-regarding style — she might demand that subordinates arrive 30 minutes early for certain meetings she attended — Wintour was obviously not in the best position to try to convince him, for instance, that he should not ask his assistant (black and Stanford-educated) to clean his golf clubs. (That was one of the many revealing details in a Business Insider exposé of the food magazine that arrived this week.)
Race is a fraught subject at Conde Nast. Several employees of color I spoke with, all of them laid off over the past few years, talked about the challenges they faced. They struggled to be heard or get the resources they needed to do their jobs at the highest levels; they faced ignorance and lazy stereotyping from white bosses when the subject of covering black culture came up; they all said they were exhausted by always having to explain it all.
Even though they were no longer at Conde Nast, not one of them felt free to speak on the record out of fear of retaliation from the company or the concern that they would be looked at as complainers, making it much harder to find work.
One former staff member who is black could not fail to see the irony in being made to go to unconscious bias training — which became mandatory at the company early last year — only then to lose a big chunk of his portfolio shortly thereafter. “I felt so devalued,” he said, “after working so hard.”
Unconscious bias training is supposed to alert you to your blind spots in your perception of people and ideas. But at the level of corporate and creative governance, the programming at Conde Nast has not been seamlessly woven into the company’s broader philosophy. Last month, during a round of layoffs, in which 100 people were let go amid the economic calamities of COVID-19, the company dismissed three Asian American editors, all of whom covered culture at different publications.
Among the Top 10 editorial leaders listed on Vogue’s masthead, all are white. According to a spokesman for Conde Nast, across divisions on Vogue’s editorial side, people of color make up 14% of senior managers. On June 5, amid global protests spurred by the death of George Floyd, Wintour sent a note to her staff acknowledging that “it can’t be easy to be a black employee at Vogue” and that the magazine had “not found enough ways to elevate and give space to black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators.”
Although Vogue has made a greater effort to feature black women on its covers in recent years — Rihanna, Serena Williams, Lupita Nyong’o — the gate swings open far more easily for those who are not. And in this particular area, too, legacy weighs heavily. When LeBron James made history as the first black man to grace the cover in 2008, he shared the space with a white supermodel, Gisele Bündchen, who appeared as a damsel in his clutches, an unmistakable reference to King Kong.
A spokesman at Conde Nast admitted that much progress needs to be made in regard to diversity at the company, but he defended Wintour’s record, pointing out that she has passionately supported various designers of color throughout her career, helping to raise money for them through her work with the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She also installed two black editors to lead Teen Vogue, genuinely radical in its content, one following the other (Elaine Welteroth and then Lindsay Peoples Wagner).
At the same time, Wintour has presided over Vogue for 32 years, and during that period she has done more to enshrine the values of bloodline, pedigree and privilege than anyone in American media. A brief and very inconclusive list of Wintour’s assistants in the 21st century includes the Yale-educated daughter of a prominent Miami dance director, the Dartmouth-educated descendant of a major bank president, the Princeton-educated daughter of an Oscar-winning screenwriter and so on. For so long it was central to the Conde Nast ethos that you had to be thin, gorgeous and impeccably credentialed to retrieve someone else’s espresso macchiato.
Even now, as the publishing industry continues to implode and wonderful writers who could really use the work (or at least the prestigious affiliation) abound, Vogue continues to list among its contributing editors people like German heiress Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis and many others among the wellborn. Five years ago, Thurn und Taxis posted a picture on Instagram of a homeless woman reading Vogue, seated on the sidewalk, with the words, “Paris is full of surprises.” Vogue quickly issued a statement, calling the gesture distasteful, and then proceeded to run her byline on its website at least 10 more times.
Last year, Grace Coddington, another contributor, who had held enormous influence over what was shot for Vogue and how in her many years as the magazine’s creative director, was photographed with her collection of “mammy” jars, racist ceramics depicting African American women as servile maids.
Wintour clearly believes that she can break from the past and kill off any vestiges of a system steeped in the benighted values for which she has become the corporate avatar. The public apology from Bon Appétit was quite startling in its admission of failure, particularly its concession that the magazine “continued to tokenize” the people of color that it did hire.
As part of her contribution to this new wave of progressivism, Wintour wrote a piece for Vogue.com a week after the death of George Floyd, aligning herself with Black Lives Matter and calling on Joe Biden to select a woman of color as his running mate.
For someone who had seemed so averse to activism as the world has roiled from inequality for years, it felt like a desperate grasp for relevance. A spokesman for the company bristled at the suggestion, arguing that it is Conde Nast’s job “to cover what’s going on in the culture in the moment.”
As it happens, André Leon Talley, who recently wrote a memoir about his complicated relationship with Wintour as a black man and longtime former editor at Vogue, also has a lot to say about the current moment. This week in a radio interview with Sandra Bernhard, he offered his opinion about his ex-boss’s professed transformation.
“I wanna say one thing: Dame Anna Wintour is a colonial broad; she’s a colonial dame,” he told Bernhard. “I do not think she will ever let anything get in the way of her white privilege.”

New York State Moves to Check Police Conduct: [National Desk]

Full text: The state became one of the first to make major changes in police practices in the wake of George Floyd's killing, which has spurred nationwide protests.
New York on Friday became one of the first states to take meaningful action to restrict police forces after the killing of George Floyd, banning the use of chokeholds by law enforcement and repealing a half-century-old law that has kept police disciplinary records secret in the state.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the expansive package of bills less than three weeks after Mr. Floyd's death at the hands of the police in Minneapolis, which has since sparked widespread civil unrest and demonstrations against police brutality and racism.
New York City also took tentative steps toward meeting protesters' calls to "defund the police." On Friday, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said the Council had identified $ 1 billion in cuts to the Police Department's $ 6 billion budget, and would urge Mayor Bill de Blasio to agree in advance of the July 1 budget deadline.
Mr. de Blasio quickly rejected the proposal, while indicating that he was open to further negotiations over the size of the Police Department. "The mayor has said we're committed to reprioritizing funding and looking for savings, but he does not believe a $ 1 billion cut is the way to maintain safety," said Freddi Goldstein, Mr. de Blasio's press secretary.
A similar reckoning is occurring across the nation, as lawmakers are weighing various changes to police tactics that may have exacerbated racial disparities in law enforcement. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for an immediate end to the use of "strangleholds" last week, saying such use of force had "no place any longer in 21st century practices and policing."
In Washington, where authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Park for President Trump to stage a photo op at St. John's Church, the District of Columbia's Council unanimously passed a sweeping series of changes earlier this week, including prohibiting the use of chemical irritants, riot gear and stun grenades on demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights.
A few hours after Mr. Cuomo signed the bills in New York, Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa signed a similar measure into law on Friday. The bill, passed unanimously by the Iowa Legislature the night before, also included a ban on most police chokeholds and empowered the state attorney general to investigate police misconduct.
And in Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed on May 25, the City Council voted on Friday to seek "a transformative new model for cultivating safety in our city" just days after vowing to dismantle the city's police department. But even there, change would take time -- months if not more, and not before a citywide vote and rounds of bureaucratic wrangling.
The obstacles to the kind of sweeping and immediate changes made in New York could also be seen in Minnesota's State Capitol, where an ambitious package of police reforms proposed by Democrats faced an uncertain future.
Republicans who control one legislative chamber said they would oppose some of the most far-reaching changes, including restoring voting rights to felons or putting the state's attorney general, rather than local prosecutors, in charge of investigating killings by the police.
The clash over how much change lawmakers are willing to accept in a state that has become ground zero of a new movement to address racism and police brutality shows how difficult it may be to bring real changes across a patchwork of state governments and in a divided Washington.
"For years, policing has been a neglected corner of government when it comes to legislative activity," said Barry Friedman, the director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law. "I see movement in both parties to address that, but that movement is definitely unequal right now and that's too bad."
House Democrats unveiled a sweeping bill on Monday aimed at addressing racial bias and overuse of force in policing. The bill would require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras, and would limit the military-grade equipment being shipped to state and local law enforcement.
Republicans, who have been put on the defensive by public support for both protests and police reform, are still formulating a legislative response. But at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Republicans on the panel spoke of "bad apples" among police officers, and decried calls to defund the police, even though no such proposal was in the Democrats' bill.
In the Senate, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sole African-American in the Republican majority conference, said he would introduce a police reform bill next week, calling for reports on use of force incidents, and a so-called duty to intervene, by officers witnessing incidents of police brutality.
"This is an issue whose time has come," Senator Scott said on the "Today" show on Thursday, adding that police tactics against minorities has been "a serious issue that has been running rampant throughout communities of color for far too long."
At the same time, the role of police in daily life was also being examined, with school districts in several states abandoning the use of sworn officers in hallways, saying their presence interferes with their educational missions.
"This is not just about Mr. Floyd's murder," Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said shortly before signing the bills in Manhattan. "It's about being here before, many, many times before. It is about a long list that has been all across this country that always makes the same point: injustice against minorities in America by the criminal justice system."
The legislation in New York, which the Democrat-controlled Legislature passed earlier this week, was years in the making. Many of the bills were introduced years ago but gained little traction because of fierce opposition from powerful police unions that for years held sway over elected officials in Albany, especially when Republicans controlled the State Senate.
But Democrats, propelled by the national progressive fervor that swept the nation in 2018, took control of the State Capitol two years ago, opening the door to long-stalled liberal priorities.
Still, it was Mr. Floyd's death, and the protests that followed, that provided the catalyst to get this week's legislation over the finish line.
Weeks of massive and relentless protests from New York City to Buffalo, and bubbling anti-police sentiment, prompted legislators to hurry back into session in Albany and swiftly vote on the set of bills -- overcoming the law enforcement unions that wield their influence through sizable campaign contributions and vociferous condemnation of officials they deem as weak on crime.
The most contentious of the legislation was a measure to repeal an obscure statute in the state's civil code known as 50-a, which prohibits the release of "all personnel records used to evaluate performance" of police officers without permission from the officer or a judge.
Under Mr. de Blasio, the New York Police Department expanded the interpretation of the law to shield the results of disciplinary hearings against individual officers, leading to criticism that the department was shrouding police abuse in secrecy. Mr. Cuomo for years remained largely noncommittal on efforts to repeal 50-a.
Criticism of the law came to a head following the death of Eric Garner in Staten Island after a police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, held him in a chokehold in 2014. Despite a lawsuit to make them public, Mr. Pantaleo's disciplinary records remained secret for years until they were leaked, revealing a long history of complaints.
In stark contrast, the past misconduct complaints of the police officer who knelt on the neck of Mr. Floyd, Derek Chauvin, were made public shortly after Mr. Floyd's death because Minnesota doesn't have such a law barring their disclosure. In fact, New York was one of the few remaining states with such a secrecy law; California had one of the most restrictive ones until state legislators dismantled it two years ago.
Mr. Cuomo, who signed four of the 10 bills lawmakers passed, and is expected to sign the others, also signed into law a bill that would give recourse to people who believe someone called a police officer on them because of their race, gender, nationality or any other protected class.
The new law banning the use of chokeholds by law enforcement officers -- named after Mr. Garner, whose mother, Gwen Carr, attended the law's signing ceremony -- makes the use of the technique a felony. Another law, pushed by a group of black mothers whose sons were killed by the police, codified into state law a special prosecutor's office within the state's attorney general's office to investigate and prosecute police killings of unarmed civilians.
Building on the momentum, the governor announced he would issue an executive order to require New York's roughly 500 local police departments and agencies to develop plans to modernize their policing tactics with community input by April 2021, or risk becoming ineligible for state funding.
Law enforcement unions quickly pounced on state leaders, accusing them of politicizing police officers' safety and arguing that the repeal of 50-a would recklessly make public the unsubstantiated misconduct complaints against officers, possibly causing reputational harm.
Michael Palladino, the president of the National Police Defense Foundation, said the law changes would "emasculate" police officers. Mr. Cuomo, he said, "wouldn't stray five feet from his police security detail on his own, yet he'll do anything to emasculate law enforcement for his own political gain."
Mike O'Meara, president of the New York State Association of Patrolmen's Benevolent Associations, claimed that the police averaged 375 million annual interactions with the public and that the vast majority were positive.
"But we all read in the papers all week that in the black community, mothers are worried about their children coming home from school without being killed by a cop," Mr. O'Meara said. "What world are we living in? That does not happen!"

New York Police Will Stop Enforcing Street-Vendor Laws, but Questions Linger [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — After two decades selling homemade tamales in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Sonía Pèrez has received her fair share of tickets from the police. Often, they are for minor infractions: being too far from the curb, being too close to a crosswalk.
But a few years ago, an encounter with the police frightened her. While checking to see her vendor license, Pèrez said, four officers harassed her oldest daughter, who they claimed was affiliated with a gang because she had tattoos and piercings. The officers also threatened Pèrez with a $50,000 fine, she said.
That threat, she later found out, was empty. But it is part of a larger pattern of discrimination against Hispanic and black vendors, said Pèrez, a single mother who supports her four children with her business.
“I don’t know what they’re going to ask me, or I don’t know how they’re going to act,” said Pèrez, 49, speaking through a translator. “If I respond in a way that they don’t like, they could attack me, or they could arrest me right there for selling.”
Pèrez was heartened by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s announcement Sunday that the New York City Police Department would no longer enforce street-vendor regulations, but she is uncertain what it means for her and her business, and fears even steeper fines.
“He just said the police are not going to handle it anymore, but who is?” she said. “We don’t want worse than police.”
As protesters across the city and nation demand sweeping changes in law enforcement, de Blasio announced that a civilian agency would be created to enforce regulations instead of police.
He did not specify when the police would stop enforcement or whether vendors would still be subject to oversight by the other city departments that inspect or regulate them: fire, health, transportation, parks, sanitation and consumer affairs. Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for his office, did not answer questions about how people would be chosen to oversee the vendors, or how many.
“We are finalizing next steps,” she wrote in an email.
The mayor also said he would redirect some police funding, but Lapeyrolerie would not confirm that money for the new agency would come from the Police Department.
Protests sparked by the death of George Floyd have grown into calls to defund police departments. That would mean reducing police budgets and transferring civic regulations — resolving family and school disputes, moving homeless people into shelters — to other agencies. Vendor oversight would fall well within those bounds.
“It was a gesture,” Carlos Menchaca, a City Council member, said of the mayor’s announcement. “I think it was to placate the people of New York.”
Street vendors are often the subject of complaints from store owners, business improvement districts, building managers and neighbors over noise, smells, sidewalk congestion and other nuisances. A public information officer for the Police Department said that enforcing the laws governing the vendors is vital to protecting public health, food safety and keeping sidewalks clear.
“We will work with City Hall to transition these responsibilities to the agency tasked with vendor enforcement going forward,” she wrote in a Wednesday email.
In 2018, long before the calls to defund the police, City Council members proposed a new framework for how vendors could be regulated: Intro 1116, a bill that has the support of more than half the council but has not yet come up for a vote.
The measure outlines plans to create a civilian unit that would be trained to oversee both vendor enforcement and education. (Lapeyrolerie did not say whether the mayor would support the bill, which would need his signature.)
The plan would also increase the number of permits available to food vendors for the first time in four decades, which Menchaca, a sponsor of Intro 1116, said could help the city’s economic recovery from the pandemic. A bill to lift that cap is in committee in the state Senate.
The Street Vendor Project of the Urban Justice Center, an advocacy group, estimates that there are 10,000 to 20,000 vendors across the five boroughs. But only 853 people receive nonfood permits, and only about 5,000 can legally vend food, according to Matthew Shapiro, the center’s legal director.
As with taxi medallions, the organization says capping the amount of permits is dangerous, because many vendors have to sell illegally, risking fines, property confiscation and arrest. There is a decadelong waitlist for permits, and an underground market where a two-year permit (officially issued by the city for $200) can sell for $25,000 or more. De Blasio’s spokeswoman did not specify whether more licenses would be issued as part of the mayor’s plan.
“You don’t see the NYPD in any other small business enforcement,” said Mohamed Attia, director of the Street Vendor Project. “You don’t see an officer going into a restaurant and arresting a worker who is not wearing gloves. That doesn’t happen.”
For street vendors, many of whom are immigrants, any relief from police oversight is welcome. In November, officers arrested a woman selling churros on the subway. A video of the arrest drew widespread condemnation of the police.
As people of color across the United States know, an interaction with law enforcement can be perilous. Eric Garner, who died in a police chokehold six years ago on a Staten Island sidewalk, was accused of selling cigarettes. Although Garner was not a licensed vendor, Attia said police harassment is widespread.
“Why is vending a crime?” Attia asked. “What city do we live in that making a living is being criminalized?”
Nogaye Lo, a 44-year-old vendor, has also had difficult encounters with the police at her stand in Union Square. Before the coronavirus pandemic, she sold seasonal wares: scarves in the winter, jewelry in the summer.
Now, as demonstrators fill the park almost every night, she sells T-shirts bearing the faces of people who have been killed by the police. On the back, they read, “Black Lives Matter.”
For Lo, an immigrant from Senegal, the message is personal. She has four sons, and she fears what could happen to them whenever they leave the house.
Officers regularly confront her, issuing tickets and confiscating her merchandise, she said. She has been arrested without cause, she said, and had to spend the night in jail. Once, an officer pushed her, putting his hands on her breasts, she said. He apologized, but she is still furious.
“We’re not animals,” she said. “We’re not garbage. We’re human beings.”
Even though she worries that a civilian agency could impose heavy fines, she fears the police more.
“Before you’re leaving your house, you’re thinking about if you’re going to be sleeping in the house again,” she said. “All the time, when you’re going out, you’re thinking, ‘Oh, cops are going to arrest me when I go to the table.’ That’s ridiculous.”

MINNEAPOLIS — The calls for sweeping reforms to policing that have reverberated since the death of George Floyd slammed into the messy realities of lawmaking Friday, offering a glimpse of the uncertainties of turning protest into policy.
Nearly a week after nine members of the Minneapolis City Council made a drastic pledge to take apart the Police Department, the council took its first steps Friday in a slow, complicated process that could eventually lead to shifting funds from the city police. But that process will last for more than a year and require voters to actually approve of removing the Police Department from the city’s core departments.
And in the state Capitol, an ambitious package of police reforms proposed by Democrats faced an uncertain future as Republicans who control the state Senate said they would oppose some of the most far-reaching changes, such as restoring voting rights to felons or putting the state’s attorney general, rather than local prosecutors, in charge of prosecuting killings by the police.
Republican leaders said they would support five less contentious measures, including banning chokeholds and providing more money for “de-escalation” training. Democrats said the Republicans’ proposals fell short of the fundamental changes that tens of thousands of people had demanded in how the police treat black men and women and other people of color.
“We should do the work that the people have demanded that we do,” Melissa Hortman, speaker of the Minnesota House and a Democrat, said in an interview.
There is not much time for finding common ground. As a special session got underway Friday to address policing, the economy and the coronavirus, leading Republicans said they hoped to wrap up all of their work by the end of next week.
“We’re not going to stay in special session for months and months,” state Sen. Paul Gazelka, the Republican majority leader, said at a briefing Friday. “We’re going to do the things we can do now.”
It was a sobering reality check for Democrats who have embraced activists’ calls for transformative changes that include going as far as cutting the budgets of local police departments or drastically rethinking how the police interact with people in their communities.
“This is not what Minnesotans of all persuasions are asking us to do,” said state Sen. Jeff Hayden, a Democrat whose district includes the Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd died after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Still, police departments, cities and states across the country have already made a flurry of changes after the upheaval, including re-examining police budgets, banning chokeholds and removing officers from schools.
On Friday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York signed a broad package of bills aimed at combating police brutality. Some of the bills had languished for years in the face of opposition from police unions. The bills included a ban on the use of chokeholds as well as the repeal of a decades-old statute that had allowed the police to keep disciplinary records of officers secret.
But while Minnesota has become ground zero for protests, it is also showing the enduring obstacles facing the overarching changes many activists are demanding, especially in a 2020 battleground that is the only state in the nation where Democrats and Republicans each control one of the two legislative chambers.
While Democrats and liberal activists are leading the calls for change on the streets of American cities, many state governments are controlled by Republicans who back law enforcement and are leery of proposals to defund police departments or make it easier to sue officers. Polling is showing support for many reforms but widespread opposition to defunding the police, a term that can mean different things in different cities.
Reform efforts in Washington face similar challenges after Democrats unveiled a sweeping bill this week aimed at addressing racial bias and the overuse of force in policing.
In Minneapolis, the City Council’s move to reduce the role of the Police Department was hailed by activists as a transformational change and condemned by conservatives as a lurch toward lawlessness.
Wayne Reyes Jr., whose father was shot and killed by Minneapolis police officers in 2006, said he was hopeful that lawmakers would make meaningful changes this time but said he was angry it had taken more killings for them to do so. Derek Chauvin, the former officer who has been charged with killing Floyd, was one of the officers who opened fire at Reyes’ father, Wayne Reyes Sr., a Native American man who the police said aimed a shotgun at them.
“It seems like people have been asking for these changes for a long time,” Reyes, 35, said in an interview, “and it wasn’t until just the last couple of weeks that people are starting to look and listen a little bit.”
On Friday, Minneapolis’ efforts to alter policing in the city appeared mostly to be a slow, governmental grind. To achieve its aims of dismantling the Police Department as it currently exists, the City Council plans to ask voters to approve rewriting a section of the city charter to eliminate a provision that dictates a minimum number of police officers. That change would give council members much more flexibility to divert funds to mental health and other agencies that could respond to calls traditionally handled by the police.
The ballot initiative would also include removing the Minneapolis Police Department from the charter — although not necessarily abolishing it altogether — and adding a new department “focused on cultivating public safety.”
The City Council also voted unanimously, at its virtual meeting, on a resolution to commit to a yearlong effort to research other models of public safety and to listen to what residents say they would like to see.
Andrea Jenkins, the vice president of the City Council, said the world was looking to Minneapolis to see how it would respond after the killing of Floyd last month.
“People have marched all over the world, all over the city of Minneapolis, and what they’re saying to us is they want change,” Jenkins said. “Not ‘fix it,’ not reform, but change. So we must take these voices seriously.”
The resolution passed on Friday creates a “Future of Community Safety Work Group” that will soon begin listening to residents, interviewing experts and studying other models of public safety to determine how various city services could replace many of the Police Department’s current functions.
Alondra Cano, the chairwoman of the public safety committee, said in an interview after the vote that the engagement of city residents would be vital to determining the right solutions for public safety in Minneapolis.
“The beauty of this project is that the answers come from the community, that collectively, the future of this city will be decided by the people who live here,” Cano said.
She added that the initiative to get rid of the city charter’s requirement that the Police Department have 0.0017 employees per city resident would remove a large hurdle that stands in the way of redirecting funds from the police to violence prevention programs and other city agencies. If the initiative does get on the ballot in November, it would require a majority of voters to pass.

What Do I Do if My Employer Does Something I Can’t Abide? [With graphic(s)]

On Taking a Stand
Q: I work at The New York Times. On June 3, the opinion section ran an o p-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton that I found deeply appalling. It wasn’t the first editorial decision opinion made that has received public pushback — nor the newsroom editors, for that matter. But this op-ed put our black staff and reporters covering protests at risk. I love my employer. I believe in the importance of The Times as an institution and am proud of my work in support of it. But I’m worried about the future of our publication and our role in the current crisis. Times employees aren’t supposed to criticize our coverage publicly, and our involvement in protests is frowned upon. I guess I’m asking: What should I do when my employer does something incredibly stupid? — Anonymous
A: When The Times published this op-ed, it was an egregious lapse in judgment — not because the senator is conservative and espousing a disagreeable opinion, but because, I would argue, he was advocating fascism. He was vigorously encouraging the use of violence to subdue what he called rioters — but what I would call people protesting unchecked police brutality against black people. This was not a matter of considering a supposedly different perspective on the protests taking place around the world. There are no two sides to racism, fascism or tyranny. This was definitely one of those moments where you could voice your disagreement and concern to your employer, ideally in concert with colleagues — and that was exactly what happened. (The Times added an editor’s note to the op-ed June 5, saying that “the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.” Disclosure: In addition to this column, I sometimes write for the opinion section.)
People are often put in impossible positions when their employer does something stupid or terrible or reckless or some combination thereof. They have to decide what, if anything, they will do about it, and more often than not, there is little recourse.
In some workplaces, you can speak up. Having the support of a union is especially helpful, but only 11.6% of American workers are represented by one. Without organized labor, you’re on your own — and that’s a lonely place to be when you have to choose what’s right and what’s realistic. If you do decide to take a stand, you can identify the problem, how you think the company should address that problem and what consequences, if any, you will impose if no action is taken. There are, however, few workplaces where someone can safely take a stand without professional repercussions. There are few people who can afford to risk their income and livelihood.
You have to pick your battles. You have to calibrate the difference between stupid and unacceptable, what you can live with and what you cannot. Because you work for a newspaper that will always publish a range of content, some of which you agree with and some of which you do not, you also have to calibrate the difference between disagreement and disgust.
That’s the tidy answer that doesn’t really force you to make the difficult decision. But now, more than ever, with so much at stake, we have to be willing to make difficult decisions. We have to be willing to make ourselves uncomfortable in service of what’s right. When Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on George Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, three of his co-workers stood by and did nothing. When a police officer in Buffalo shoved a 75-year-old man to the ground, dozens of his co-workers walked past that fallen man, bleeding from his ear. They did nothing.
Most situations in which you object to your employer’s conduct won’t be so extreme. But something terrible happened in this country, something that has happened with horrifying frequency. Each time we think maybe this time, something will change. For a few days or even a few weeks, change seems possible — and then we all get comfortable again. We forget about whatever terrible thing once held our attention. A new terrible thing happens. We get outraged. It’s a vicious cycle, but it is one we can break. When your employer does something that violates your ethical code, when it does something that endangers employees or the greater community, you have to ask yourself if you are going to do nothing — or get angry, vent and hold your employer accountable in whatever ways you can. I am, perhaps, simplifying the choices you can make, but maybe doing the right thing is far simpler than we allow ourselves to believe.
Too Soon
Q: I received an email from my boss that said our company is planning to reopen our office around the third week of June. In her email, she asks how comfortable I am with going back, riding the subway and driving to other sites. She also outlines safety measures: 50% occupancy, masks, disinfection, temperature checks. What do I say? I do not want to ride the subway and spend long periods of time indoors with other people when I can just as easily do my work from home. I do think she has good intentions, but I also know she’s one of those people who likes to be involved in everything and appear busy, and she expects the same from others. In essence, she thinks working from home is not real work. — Anonymous
A: These days, when someone sneezes in my vicinity, I immediately start to feel unwell, feverish, consumptive. I am, like many people, worried and intimately aware of how fragile we are. It’s going to take time for most people to feel comfortable returning to work and spending time in public around other humans with unknown if not questionable hygiene practices. There are just so many ways you might encounter the dreaded corona-droplets. It doesn’t seem worth the risk, especially when you are lucky enough to be able to do your job remotely.
Working from home is indeed real, no matter what your boss believes. Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economics professor, did a two-year study and found that employees who work from home were more productive and needed fewer sick days. (They also took less time off, which may or may not be a good thing.) Tell your boss the truth, that you are not ready to return to the office. If she pushes back, suggest a compromise where, perhaps, you come into the office once a week, or for staff meetings or other activities that are better face to face. We cannot hide from the world forever, but no one should fault you for thinking that next week is too soon to get back to what was once normal work life.

As crowds have surged through American cities to protest the killing of George Floyd, one of the striking differences from years past has been the sheer number of white people.
From Minneapolis to Washington, D.C., marchers noticed the change and wondered what it meant that so many white Americans were showing up for the cause of justice for black Americans.
“I was shocked to see so many white kids out here,” said Walter Wiggins, 67, as he sat near the heart of the protests in Washington last week. Wiggins, a retired federal worker, who is black, remembered attending the 1963 March on Washington and other civil rights events with his parents. “Back then it was just black folks.”
Why is this happening now? The nine-minute video of a white police officer refusing to remove his knee from Floyd’s neck has horrified Americans as attitudes on race were already changing, particularly among white liberals. Another driver is opposition to President Donald Trump, who has drawn large crowds of protesters since his election. Finally, there’s the coronavirus pandemic, which has left millions of Americans — including college students — cooped up at home, craving human contact. The result was hundreds of thousands of white Americans in the streets.
“This is utterly different from anything we’ve seen,” said Douglas McAdam, a Stanford sociologist who studies social movements, referring to the recent protests. Since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, every highly publicized death of an African American man while in police custody brought protests, he said, “but overwhelmingly in the black community.”
The pattern evident in the streets has now been confirmed by early demographic data: Researchers fanned out across three American cities last weekend and found overwhelmingly young crowds with large numbers of white and highly educated people.
A team of 11 volunteers asked every fifth person they encountered to fill out a survey and gathered data from 195 people in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. The researchers, Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, and Michael Heaney, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, used an established method for studying street protests. They said their numbers provide only rough estimates but offer the first, more systematic look at who the protesters are.
White protesters made up 61% of those surveyed in New York over the weekend, according to the researchers, and 65% of protesters in Washington. On Sunday in Los Angeles, 53% of protesters were white.
It’s not just protests. White Americans are going through a wave of self-examination, buying books about racism, talking to black friends and arguing within their own families. Still, how much of this translates into broader change remains to be seen.
“All of these white people on the front lines of these protests go back to their white neighborhoods and their overwhelmingly white and better schools,” said Hakeem Jefferson, who is black and a political scientist at Stanford University. “They protest alongside them, but they don’t live alongside them,” he said, referring to black people.
He added, “As much as people really want that progress narrative, I don’t think it exists yet.”
While opinion polls on race do not always capture what people actually think, surveys have shown that racial attitudes among white Americans have been shifting. There has been a sudden and sharp turn by white liberals toward a much more sympathetic view of black people in recent years, said Andrew Engelhardt, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, who has published papers documenting the shift.
“In the last 10 years or so we’ve seen something unprecedented with white Democrats,” Engelhardt said.
Racial groups tend to feel warmest toward their own group. White people favor white people, and black people favor black people. But by 2018, white liberals felt more positively about blacks, Latinos and Asians than they did about whites. That reversal surfaced in a recent poll by the Pew Research Center: About 49% of white Democrats said it bothered them that their nominee would be a white man, while just 28% of black Democrats said so.
The researchers who collected data last weekend found that the crowds were overwhelmingly young and well educated. More than three-quarters of those surveyed were under the age of 34, and 82% of white protesters had a college degree, while 67% of black protesters had one.
Younger Americans are much more racially diverse than earlier generations and tend to have different views on race.
“My parents have a lot of learning to do,” said Isabel Muir, 22, a recent college graduate, who was standing in front of St. John’s Church on Saturday in Washington. She said she was having conversations on social media, and with her mother, on “how to be a white ally.”
When her mother, who is 62, questioned the property destruction, Muir said she told her that “we have to understand this community’s pain. This economy has been built on their backs.”
Trump also appeared to be a powerful driver. Of whites surveyed in Fisher’s work, 45% cited Trump as a motivation for joining the protests, compared with 32% of blacks. Whites were the group most likely to report having attended the 2017 Women’s March but the second-least likely, after Asians, to report having attended the March for Racial Justice in 2017.
“My outrage for Trump is so strong,” said Tanya Holtzapple, 56, who is white, walking in a crowd of people on I Street on Saturday in Washington. Since he was elected, she said, she has felt “energized,” and marching was channeling that energy. “I’m not just sitting at home,” she said.
Since 2017, as many as 27 million people have taken part in protests opposing Trump, equal to about 8% of the population, according to researchers from Harvard University and the University of Connecticut.
These protests are part of that surge, said Fisher, who compiled the data on the protests last weekend. Groups like Indivisible, March On and Swing Left, whose goal is to prevent Trump’s reelection, may see joining the anti-police-brutality protests both as a moral necessity and a way to “expand their tent,” she said.
“It’s emblematic of this moment, which is about the big-L left starting to pay attention to this issue,” Fisher said. “Groups not typically focused on racial justice and police brutality are turning people out.”
White Americans have taken part in struggles for racial equality at times — as abolitionists in the 19th century and Freedom Riders in the 1960s. But scholars of race in America said it remained to be seen whether a heightened awareness of racial injustice now would lead to broad change. Condemning the killing of George Floyd, said Jennifer Chudy, a political scientist at Wellesley College, was “relatively costless.”
“Who is going out on a limb when they are distancing themselves from murder?” Chudy asked. Her work has shown that most white Americans have sympathy for a stark story of a sufferer and a villain — much like in the video of Floyd’s death — but far lower rates of sympathy for more abstract mistreatment, like a polluting bus depot in a mostly black neighborhood. Some participants will become passionate for life, she said, but most won’t. For some of them, “it may be nothing more than a fad.”
In a Monmouth University poll released this week, 71% of white respondents called racism and discrimination “a big problem” in the United States, a spike since 2015. But Jefferson, the political scientist at Stanford, argued that it was too early to declare that a national reckoning had arrived. He pointed to another finding in the same poll: Just 49% of white Americans say that police are more likely to use excessive force against a black culprit.
Karyn Wills, 57, who came to the protest in Washington on Saturday, said she was hopeful. Wills, who is African American and a medical doctor, remembers protesting as a child with her parents in Chicago. She raised her children in suburban Maryland and said she believed their generation, which was so much more racially mixed than hers, would bring progress. “Some people out here are just curious; they’ll have a sign, post on social media, and life will go on,” she said. “But for some of them it really will spark change.”

WASHINGTON — For the first three years of President Donald Trump’s time in office, his blunt-force view of the military was confined to threatening U.S. adversaries: “fire and fury” if North Korea challenged U.S. troops. A warning that he would “shoot down and destroy” Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf. Billions spent to rejuvenate a nuclear arsenal he viewed as the ultimate source of U.S. power.
His generals and admirals accepted a commander in chief with what they diplomatically dismissed as a “unique style” — and they welcomed the increase in military spending. His chief diplomats, while embarrassed, saw some utility in trying to force adversaries to the table.
Now, that tolerance has frayed. The split evident in the past few days between Trump and current and former military leaders over using active-duty troops on American soil against largely peaceful protesters and looters, and his threat to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, has laid bare the chasm in the national security community that was forming even when he ran for office in 2016.
Back then it was only a limited group of “Never Trumpers” — establishment Republican national security professionals repelled by Trump’s description of how U.S. power should be wielded around the world — who wrote and spoke of the dangers. He “lacks the character, values and experience” to be president, they wrote, and “would put at risk our country’s national security.”
This week, it was his former defense secretary, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a range of other retired senior officers who were saying in public what they previously said only in private: That the risk lies in the fact that Trump regards the military, which historically has prized its nonpartisan, apolitical role in society, as just another political force to be massed to his advantage.
“There is a thin line between the tolerance we have witnessed from the military for three years and the point where it becomes intolerable,” said Douglas E. Lute, a retired three-star Army general who ran Afghanistan and Pakistan operations on the National Security Council for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and later became the U.S. ambassador to NATO. “The minor episodes have accumulated over the years and made imperceptible the sum” of the damage being done.
Trump’s walk to a church near the White House on Monday, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, in tow, may have been the moment everything shifted, Lute said.
“As that team walked across Lafayette Park with the president,” he said, “they crossed that line.”
As some of those senior leaders have faced a hail of criticism since then, their ties to the president seem to be shifting back to the troops and the Constitution. Esper, a former Army officer and Persian Gulf War veteran turned Beltway lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon, seemed particularly stunned at what he had stumbled into.
When he told NBC News that “I didn’t know where I was going,” he was speaking narrowly about being unaware that he was headed to the church. But his comment seemed to apply more broadly: That he did not understand that he was symbolically embracing the use of U.S. military forces — the National Guard, and not yet active-duty troops — to suppress peaceful protest. He did not help himself by declaring that same day, to governors, that the mission was to “dominate the battle space” in American cities, as if he were discussing an operation in Anbar province.
After Esper said Wednesday that the Insurrection Act “should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” many in the Pentagon wonder if he can last. There is speculation about possible resignations from some senior officials.
Trump must have noticed that, one by one, the military chiefs issued statements to the troops reminding them that free speech and assembly are enshrined in the Constitution, and that is where their loyalty must reside. Those statements made no reference to Trump.
All this may dissipate if the president backs down from his threat to put active-duty troops on the streets, as he does so often, or the protests and looting subside.
But something remarkable has happened in the past four days: The last institution inside his own government that Trump has not gone to war with is now questioning what to do should it be ordered to go into American streets even if the protests and looting remain at a level that could be managed without militarizing law enforcement.
Trump loves wrapping himself in the regalia of the military, wearing its caps, touring its “powerful” aircraft carriers, talking about “my generals.” He was hardly the first president to rely on the military as a political prop: Franklin Delano Roosevelt did it throughout World War II; Dwight D. Eisenhower embodied the generation that won the war; Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter had all served.
But for Trump, who avoided the risk of being drafted into the Vietnam War with a diagnosis of bone spurs, acceptance in the Pentagon was key — to him and to his base. He celebrated the hiring of Gen. Jim Mattis as his first defense secretary, calling him “Mad Dog,” an appellation the general hated. And then he went looking for other generals: Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser, who was forced to resign and was succeeded by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. And his second chief of staff was another general, John Kelly.
None of those relationships ended well. But it was Mattis’ decision to break his long silence, and to declare that Trump was “the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,” that broke the dam.
Mattis, as a student of the rise and fall of civilizations, added: “We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ‘battle space’ that our uniformed military is called upon to ‘dominate.’ At home, we should use our military only when requested to do so, on very rare occasions, by state governors.” His critique, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Thursday, was “true and honest and necessary and overdue,” a rare Republican break with Trump.
Trump dismissed Mattis in a tweet Wednesday as “the world’s most overrated General” and said that “his primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations.”
Trump seems to view the military as an extension of domestic law enforcement as much as overseas combat.
But it was not until this week that the consequences of those differing views about the purposes of the U.S. military became evident to many Americans. Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the country had reached “an inflection point” and denounced the use of the military to support the political acts of a president who had “laid bare his disdain for the rights of peaceful protest in this country.”
“The United States has a long and, to be fair, sometimes troubled history of using the armed forces to enforce domestic laws,” Mullen wrote in The Atlantic. “The issue for us today is not whether this authority exists, but whether it will be wisely administered.”
For many of these officers, the question was whether Trump was aware of that history. The Declaration of Independence, several noted, dwelled on the complaints that the King of England “kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures,” and tried to “render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.”
That is pretty close to what Trump did Monday night when he declared that Milley was “in charge” of what was happening in the streets. It is not a role, it turns out, that most in his military want.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
On the evening of June 1, Jimmy Fallon sat behind a well-worn table in a corner of the Sagaponack, New York, farmhouse that has become the substitute studio of “The Tonight Show.”
The atmosphere was palpably tense for this typically lighthearted late-night comedy program; Fallon was wearing a sweater and clasping his hands as he looked into the camera lens of an iPhone held by his wife, Nancy Juvonen. Although nothing has been normal lately, he told his audience, “I’m not going to have a normal show tonight.”
In a sometimes quavering voice, Fallon said he was sorry for wearing blackface in an old “Saturday Night Live” sketch that had recently been recirculating online. He did not specifically mention the death of George Floyd — that would come later in the program, in conversations with Derrick Johnson, the president and chief executive of the NAACP, CNN anchor Don Lemon and anti-racism educator Jane Elliott. But Fallon broadly acknowledged the days of civil unrest still transpiring and the “senseless violence that erupts and disrupts the entire country and now the world.”
He also said he had been scrutinizing himself, trying to understand what he could do better and how he could use his voice to help break the cycle of anger, sadness and fear.
As Fallon observed in his remarks, simply wishing for things to get better would not be good enough. “We can’t say, ‘Be the change,’ and just sit around tweeting, ‘Be the change, be the change,’” he said. “What is the change? How do I change? How do I do it? What do I do?”
But first, he said, he had to deal with the errors and the inhibitions that had been keeping him quiet. “I’m clearly not an expert,” he said. “I’m clearly a late-night talk-show host. And I screwed it up already.”
If the coronavirus era has forced the late-night programs to take a back-to-basics approach and rediscover their core values, then Fallon, through equal parts intent, accident and necessity, has been steering “The Tonight Show” in a more personal, intimate direction.
Since mid-March, when production of “The Tonight Show” was shut down at NBC’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters, Fallon has been hosting a homemade version of the program from his 2.2-acre spread in the Hamptons. While his viewers are living through tumultuous, unpredictable times, his answer has been to offer them gentle comedic comfort alongside his wife and their two young daughters.
Fallon, who is 45, had hoped that presenting this stripped-down show in the company of his family would let people see him as a thoughtful, compassionate person rather than an overeager caricature.
As he explained in an interview, “It’s a side that you didn’t know — ‘Oh, I always thought he was just a goofball, silly guy that didn’t really care.’ No, I really care about so many things.”
But this ambition has been sorely tested by recent events. In a nation already racked by a pandemic, Fallon wanted to speak about the protests against racism and police violence; he wanted to make a “Tonight Show” that amplified the calls for change rising up from these demonstrations. But even before he apologized for his role in the blackface segment, it was unclear if he was the ideal person for this job.
Fallon, by his own admission, is an entertainer who thrives on fun and frivolity. He is also vulnerable to a zeitgeist that can quickly turn against his down-the-middle program — he is still criticized for tousling the hair of then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016 — and favor fellow hosts who are more comfortable staking out bolder positions.
Topics like the killings of black Americans by police officers are horrifying, and they are perhaps unsuited to a host who is simultaneously trying to account for a past transgression that perpetuated a long-standing racist practice that continues to reverberate in entertainment, education and politics. The recent efforts of “The Tonight Show” and other late-night programs to address these subjects have once again called attention to how predominantly white and male this genre remains.
While Fallon doesn’t want to make a show that is even slightly polarizing, he did not want to sit this moment out, either.
“You can’t watch the news and have it be this raw and then go right back to what you’re doing,” he told me. “I wanted to read the room and say, yeah, I’m dealing with it. I’m watching what you’re watching and I want to help, too.”
Fallon’s public reckoning drew some praise as a step in the right direction, but it is only a first step. In a turbulent period when numerous institutions are grappling with systemic racism and how their own failures and inaction have contributed to it, performers and viewers alike are looking to see if “The Tonight Show” — and late-night TV more broadly — is ready to make good on its promises or is simply paying lip service to a cause.
“Right now, white America is in the middle of a work-in-progress moment, and black America is like, yeah, we’re going to keep checking on your progress,” said comedian W. Kamau Bell. “We need you to show your work.”
Aisha Tyler, the comic, actor and TV host, said, “This country has been deeply racist for 400 years, and it’s not going to get fixed because someone goes on and apologizes for a joke that they made 20 years ago.”
“It’s going to get changed,” she continued, “because of the choices that they continue to make over time.”
A Forced Evolution
In late May, I spent time remotely observing the making of a “Tonight Show” that now seems worlds away. On a Thursday morning, staff members gathered on Zoom for a creative meeting and spoke from their homes in New York and Los Angeles about their feelings of cabin fever as they prepared for the day ahead.
“I’m so ready for people,” said Jeremy Bronson, a producer. “I’m ready to see other humans in my life.”
The energy in the virtual room picked up when Fallon joined around noon; he was wearing a long-sleeve T-shirt and his once orderly coif was drifting noticeably into shagginess.
While he reviewed plans for that evening’s show and heard pitches for future segments, Fallon also riffed on inside jokes with his colleagues and spun stories from his showbiz career, like the time he ran into Richard Simmons, the excitable fitness guru, at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. (“He’s wearing short, short, short shorts, sitting on a sequined seahorse,” Fallon recalled. “And I’m not kidding, one leg is behind his head.”)
Fallon is not just his own in-house cheerleader — he is also the lens through which all “Tonight Show” material passes and the final arbiter of what ideas the program uses. He asked for the factual premises of monologue jokes if he didn’t know the headlines that inspired them, and he confidently waved off suggestions that didn’t fit his freewheeling vision for the program.
These digital gatherings have been the routine for the past three months, since the “Tonight Show” staff members started sheltering in place and Fallon began combing his Hamptons home for anything — supplies, locations, help from his wife — that he could use to produce the program there.
Although the process of making “The Tonight Show” has remained intact, it has been accelerated to warp speed and the pressure to keep it fresh has intensified. Gavin Purcell, a “Tonight Show” executive producer, said the sense of urgency at the program now was equal to if not greater than when he helped Fallon take over as host of NBC’s “Late Night” in 2009.
“Normally when you launch a brand-new show, you have a development period where you’re able to think about it,” Purcell said. “This is like, oh my God, we’re doing this — we’re doing it right now.”
Purcell rejoined “The Tonight Show” as its showrunner last November, replacing Jim Bell, a veteran of NBC’s “Today” and its Olympics coverage. “The Tonight Show” had been consistently losing the overall ratings race to CBS’ “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” for the past two years, and after only a few months of working on closing that gap, Fallon’s reconstituted team suddenly had to focus all its energy on just keeping the show going.
Fallon and Purcell both said it has become easier to try out new concepts, whether thinking up original ways to feature the members of the Roots, the program’s house band, or creating socially distanced segments for celebrity guests, like a TikTok dance contest with Jennifer Lopez.
There’s less time to second-guess ideas because those precious hours are needed to record the show in the afternoon and edit it into the late evening. When “The Tonight Show” was still being recorded in its NBC studio, finished episodes were usually delivered to the network around 6:30 or 7 p.m.; now, Purcell said, they get handed in “closer to the 10, 10:30 time.”
Fallon credits his at-home productivity in large part to the contributions of Juvonen, a veteran film and TV producer. She is the unseen hand in the “Tonight Show” segments produced around their house, holding the camera phone and helping to guide her husband’s performances.
She told me she harbors no desires to be a star herself — “I don’t want to be in the school play; I’m not secretly hoping you stick me in the movie,” she said. She has advocated for a spirit of authenticity in this incarnation of the show, even if it creates on-air moments of awkwardness.
“Let’s not fabricate or fake it or pretend we know what we’re doing,” she said. “If we just try, then people will at least feel that.”
‘It’s Empirically Offensive’
More than two months into the homebound “Tonight Show,” however, this approach was having little impact on its audience. In mid-May the show was averaging just over 2 million viewers a night, compared to about 3.6 million for “The Late Show” on CBS. (“The Tonight Show” remains a close competitor and sometime winner in various demographics of younger TV viewers and also performs strongly in online views on YouTube and the NBC website.)
Then, at the end of the Memorial Day weekend, video from a “Saturday Night Live” sketch depicting Fallon in blackface started gaining traction on Twitter. Originally broadcast in March 2000, the sketch imagined various celebrities auditioning to become Regis Philbin’s co-host, and Fallon had worn brown makeup to impersonate Chris Rock, an “SNL” alum. (A publicist for Rock said he declined to comment.)
The sketch also serves as a reminder of how blackface, a practice created to ridicule and demean people of color, endures in contemporary comedy. It has shown up on institutions like “SNL” and the Academy Awards, where Billy Crystal wore dark makeup to play Sammy Davis Jr. when he hosted its 2012 telecast, and in the work of performers like Jimmy Kimmel, who wore blackface to impersonate celebrities on his Comedy Central series “The Man Show.” In recent days, Netflix and other streaming services removed the BBC sketch comedy “Little Britain” amid concerns about its use of blackface.
Tyler, the host of “whose line is it anyway?” on the CW, described Fallon’s portrayal of Rock as an example of “the casual, baked-in racism of this country.”
“Black people can’t constantly be the ones raising their hands and going, ‘Hey, guys, I’m offended,’” she said. “It’s empirically offensive.”
Fallon discovered on the morning of May 26 that the clip had resurfaced and awoke to find his email inbox full of supportive messages telling him to ignore the judgments of social media. Which judgments? he wondered, and then opened Twitter and Instagram to find them teeming with hashtags like #jimmyfallonisoverparty and demands for him to be canceled.
Fallon had some prominent defenders as well: Jamie Foxx wrote in an Instagram comment that what Fallon did in the video “wasn’t black face,” adding. “We comedians I know it’s a tough time right now. But this one is a stretch.”
“Let this one go,” Foxx wrote. “We got bigger fish to fry.”
Ahmir (Questlove) Thompson, a founding member of the Roots and the musical director at “The Tonight Show,” appeared to reference the incident in a tweet where he wrote, “Since we all canceling? Can do some effective canceling? When is it time for #CopsKillingBlackPeopleIsOverParty? Where THAT energy?” His tweet also included video of a police officer pinning down Floyd by his neck. (A publicist for the Roots said the band had no comment for this article.)
But Fallon felt he had to respond to the criticism in his own voice. “I can’t let a corporation give me a planned statement to say,” he told me. “I can’t ask a publicist to give me a planned statement.”
“The Tonight Show” was airing best-of episodes that week, so that evening, Fallon posted a tweet in which he wrote that his use of blackface had been “a terrible decision,” adding, “There is no excuse for this.”
He concluded: “I am very sorry for making this unquestionably offensive decision and thank all of you for holding me accountable.”
That might have been the extent of his remarks, but by the end of that week, as a wave of demonstrations spread across the country, Fallon concluded that he would have to speak further on his program. Looking at his own past failing and the widespread national anger over systemic racism, he told me, “I can’t not connect the two.”
But speaking about issues of politics and race does not come as easily for Fallon as it does for his fellow late-night hosts. He does not use his personal history to illuminate the present day like Trevor Noah of “The Daily Show,” who is biracial and grew up in apartheid-era South Africa; he does not have the erudition of Colbert, who regularly features prominent politicians on his show; and he doesn’t have the satirical fury of Kimmel, who now hosts ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live” and who has shown an increased willingness to condemn President Donald Trump and his administration.
Still, as Fallon and his colleagues spent the weekend before the June 1 “Tonight Show” clearing the decks for a more topical broadcast, the host committed himself to speaking personally at its opening. Fallon said he did not want input from his “Tonight Show” writers and producers, but with the assistance of the publicity firm that represents him, he spoke with Johnson, the NAACP president.
In an email, Johnson shared some of the advice he gave to Fallon. He said he told the host, “It’s going to take courage and grounding yourself in morals that compel you to speak out against racism and discrimination. It will take courage to push back against what has been the ugly truth of this country for centuries. This is your moment to overcome the inclination to be silent when you see atrocities committed against Black people and to evaluate your personal biases.”
Fallon said he wrote about six pages of his own thoughts, then worked with Juvonen to shape and organize the material.
“We whittled it down to what the hardest things, the utmost honest things were,” Fallon said. “I didn’t really give it to anyone on my team. I said, I’m just going to do something. I have it written out, and I’m not going to tell you what it is. And you’ll see it when I hand over the footage for the edit.”
In his “Tonight Show” episodes for the week of June 1, Fallon also conducted interviews with black leaders like Johnson and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as well as black comedians and performers like Bell and Wyatt Cenac.
For some of these guests, the sudden interest from “The Tonight Show” and other programs has been a fraught proposition, highlighting how they are welcome on late-night television only when there are thorny matters of race to be discussed.
In an interview, Cenac told me, “In a moment like this, it exposes how white and male that landscape still is.”
Cenac, an alumnus of “The Daily Show” and his HBO series, “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas,” said that he still welcomed the opportunity to be Fallon’s guest at a time when so few of his nonwhite peers are hosting late-night shows.
“For myself and other people of color who feel like we have something that we want to say in a moment like this, these become the few avenues that we have if someone’s reaching out to us, because the networks aren’t reaching out to us,” he said.
Cenac said it was not his obligation to absolve Fallon for his blackface appearance. Having worked as an intern at “SNL,” where he saw the show use white performers to play characters of other races, Cenac said that Fallon's performance could not have happened without a series of institutional failures.
“It’s not as though he just ran out onstage, unexpectedly, and just did his Chris Rock impression,” Cenac said. “It’s hard to just rap him on the knuckles without saying, well, hold on — what is it throughout the entire system that we’re talking about? Where are the people to say, hey, are we sure this is appropriate?”
Bell, who hosts the CNN series “United Shades of America,” said he appreciated that Fallon did not put any boundaries on their conversation during his recent “Tonight Show” appearance.
“Coming on his show the way I did, to talk directly about structural, institutionalized racism in this country, I’m going to take that platform and make the best of it,” he said.
But Bell said that Fallon’s responsibilities did not end there. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that if he doesn’t continue on that path for a year, that I would feel free to come back on and play minigolf with him,” he said.
Johnson said that if late-night hosts were sincerely committed to the values they have espoused in recent days, they needed to keep demonstrating that commitment in the weeks and months to come.
“Moving forward,” he said, “individuals like Jimmy Fallon with a larger-than-life following should be vocal and visible when it comes to addressing the systemic issues that plague this country; from police brutality against Black people to institutional racism. For there to be a cultural shift, we need voices like his to acknowledge that the problem exists, engage in dialogue about how to fix the problem, and then actively contribute to the solution.”
Bell said the late-night shows and their staffs also needed to seek accountability at the networks that broadcast them. He said, “These shows need to do their own internal audits and they need to encourage their networks to ask, Are black people distributed throughout this company at all levels and in positions of power?”
Speaking by phone a few days after his June 1 episode, Fallon told me the experience of delivering its opening monologue was “almost like therapy.”
“You can corner yourself with Irish guilt,” he said. “But I was afraid of both ways — I’m afraid of being quiet and afraid of not being quiet and saying the wrong thing.”
The following Monday, Fallon was back to hosting a somewhat more traditional “Tonight Show,” telling monologue jokes about Sen. Mitt Romney’s participation in a Washington protest (“That’s like seeing the Wu-Tang Clan show up at a Kenny G concert,” Fallon said) and the reopening of American cities like Las Vegas. (“Casinos said safety is their No. 1 priority, then went back to letting everyone smoke while they play craps,” he quipped.)
He also played a portion of Spike Lee’s short film “3 Brothers,” in which footage from “Do the Right Thing” showing the character Radio Raheem being choked to death by police officers is juxtaposed with real-life recordings of the killings of George Floyd and Eric Garner.
At present no date has been set for when “The Tonight Show” will return to its Manhattan studio. Fallon said there have been “penciled-in things” that fluctuate as the program receives information from city and state officials but added that NBC’s office building presented unique challenges and it may be some time before staff members and guests are ready to return there.
Fallon said he is letting events dictate what kinds of guests and segments he should have going forward on “The Tonight Show” and offered an assurance that his own process of education and evolution is far from over.
“Something great is going to come out of this,” he said. “I’m learning, and I’m listening.”

HOUSTON — Hundreds of American flags lined the street outside George Floyd’s funeral services, as if the deceased were a member of law enforcement, not a black man killed in its custody.
The line to view his body included parents with children, co-workers, and well-wishers from out of town, many clad in black. Throughout the country, Floyd’s death has become the catalyst for protests, kicking off a national wave of reckoning with inequities that has spread from policing to the worlds of entertainment, business and media. In Houston, where Floyd grew up before moving north to Minneapolis, it was an outpouring of pain and grief.
Mya Little, 19, left the Fountain of Peace church after viewing the body, with her mother at her side.
“I do not know what we have to do, but living like this isn’t it,” she said. “Being scared to go places? Being scared to move around freely? This isn’t justice.”
To answer the pain and fear Little and millions of others have expressed in the days since Floyd’s killing last month, Democratic elected officials have taken to calling out the “systemic racism” of America. It is a phrase used to convey how institutions like law enforcement need a drastic overhaul — if not total dismantling.
But it is not clear how much will happen after officials point out the deep-rooted flaw in the system, and some progressive Democrats and activists are saying they’re worried that politicians are using the language of systemic reform but stopping short of the more radical policies to address it, such as redirecting funding from law enforcement to housing and education.
In a recent speech, former President Barack Obama said, “In a lot of ways, what has happened over the last several weeks is, challenges and structural problems here in the United States have been thrown into high relief.” Joe Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president, used a similar construction: The moment, he explained, highlighted how foundational racism is in this country.
“We need to root out systemic racism across our laws and institutions, and we need to make sure black Americans have a real shot to get ahead,” Biden said in an opinion piece on fixing policing published this week.
The language is searing. The proposed solutions in many cases go further than mainstream politicians have ever gone. But, set against how dire the politicians say situation is, the suggested fixes feel to some activists like relics of a bygone era, proposals that could reduce harm, but fail to deliver structural change.
The U.S. Conference of Mayors has assembled a Police Reform and Racial Justice Working Group. Several cities have called for task forces. Congressional lawmakers introduced the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, which would ban chokeholds, create a model use of force standard, establish a National Police Misconduct Registry, and mandate training on biases including racial profiling.
Biden endorsed several of the congressional proposals, and said he would support tying federal aid to whether police departments “meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.” In the same opinion article where he called out systemic racism, he proposed “getting cops out of their cruisers and building relationships with the people and the communities they are there to serve and protect.”
For younger progressive leaders, and some of the mourners at Floyd’s memorial services, this range of potential solutions amounts to a tacit reaffirmation to work within the system they have described as fundamentally broken.
While the Minneapolis City Council attracted national attention for its call to divert resources from its police department to other methods of public safety, calling for a police-free future remains a policy outlier, and it has been rejected by progressive national leaders including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. One initiative, called 8 Can’t Wait, pushed for immediate changes in police departments, including banning chokeholds and the practice of shooting at moving vehicles. Activists criticized it as an incremental position and a compromise, with a counter campaign describing it as “a slate of reforms that have already been tried and failed.” That campaign, called 8 to Abolition, emphasized prison abolition, ridding police departments of military-grade equipment, and diverting funds to safe housing.
Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the progressive who represents part of Minneapolis, said some of the calls to action from the Democratic caucus were not enough.
“If we are not clear in proposing policies that undo the policies that have codified our pain and trauma, then we will be in the same state,” she said.
She supports changes similar to the some of the more far-reaching activist proposals, like diverting funding from law enforcement to other investments, and stressed that they were not “pie in the sky” ideas.
Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the Democratic mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, said members of his party needed to be honest with their voters: Police reform cannot fix systemic racism in policing.
“The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house,” he said, quoting the activist and writer Audre Lorde.
In the more than two weeks since he died, “Justice for George Floyd” has become an omnipresent mantra, but there remains little agreement on what that would mean from a public policy perspective.
For a growing consortium of progressive groups focused on young voters, justice for Floyd requires dismantling police power and investing in programs related to mental health, housing and education — which activists believe would reduce crime and violence.
But among the larger Democratic electorate, including older black voters who helped Biden secure the nomination, many are holding out hope that police departments can change, and practices such as anti-bias training and better data collection can lead to improved relationships between the police and the community.
At Floyd’s public memorial Monday, the mood of the thousands who gathered to mourn was palpably different from at protests across the country. There were no uniform demands for defunding the police or antipathy for law enforcement. In many ways, the crowd reflected the breadth of opinion among black voters, including those who were encouraged by the Democratic Party’s response to the recent protests. It stood in stark contrast to the scenes in Minneapolis, where elected officials have been booed out of protests for refusing to commit to policy demands.
Yancy Carter, who brought his 14- and 17-year-old children to the public viewing, said “those who are in charge of the police departments need to make the tough calls to fire or suspend.” Tina Barron a 47-year-old Houston woman, said she was confident that more training would help police departments.
“I’m sorry, I love my Democrats,” said Nadine Scott, a 60-year-old woman in Houston who took issue with the activists not focusing on Republicans. “We just need this energy in November to vote Trump out.”
Mayor Frank Scott Jr. of Little Rock, who ran as a police reformer, said respecting the diversity of opinion — especially among black voters, who are too often seen as a monolith by white Democrats — was critical to building lasting coalitions.
“As much as people like to shout about their desire for change,” he said, “when you try to implement change, it’s often met with resistance.”
The diversity of opinion from across the electorate may give Democrats ample room to craft a response that meets the moment. Naming the problem has become a political layup, especially considering the changing racial attitudes of white liberals in the era of President Donald Trump.
But it’s proposing solutions that can be more divisive, leaving leaders who often aim for the biggest policy changes opting for small solutions.
Sanders, the democratic socialist, said he wanted to give police departments “the support they need to do their jobs better defined.” Other politicians, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, sought to redefine what activists have come to call defunding the police. He asserted in a recent news conference that “when they’re saying ‘defund the police,’ what are they saying? They’re saying we want fundamental basic change when it comes to policing — and they’re right.”
Biden’s political transformation on policing has carried him from writing a Senate bill with a Police Officer Bill of Rights in 1991 to kneeling in protest of police brutality this year. This week he rejected the idea of defunding the police outright.
Throughout his career, in Delaware and in national politics, Biden has relied on his close relationship with black communities. And like many politicians, including Obama, the former vice president has also leaned on themes of unity to inspire the country about racial progress — rather than prioritize things that may be currently unpopular.
Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and candidate for governor who is also in the running to be Biden’s vice-presidential pick, said in a recent interview that the willingness for more Democrats to call out systemic racism should be applauded. There was value in identifying systems of oppression, she said, even though it must be coupled with actions.
“If we want to dismantle an injustice system that does not see the humanity of these men and women, then we have to not only articulate what the broken pieces are, but we’ve got to then hire the right people to fix and make it better,” she said. “And that happens through voting.”
At the public viewing for Floyd’s body, that was the theme from many mourners — that police departments did not see black humanity. Warren Washington, a 56-year-old man who drove from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said politicians, in this moment, had an opportunity to “show the world we’re the America we’ve pretended to be.”
“You have to acknowledge it, but you have to also break the system down in order to restore order and confidence,” Washington said.
Inside the Fountain of Peace church, where Floyd’s body lay in a tan suit, David Hester was inspired to rededicate his life’s mission.
“I looked at him in that coffin and I told him, ‘Your death will not be in vain,’” he said.
Hester expressed skepticism that police departments could be trusted to transform themselves, “You have the foxes manning the henhouse here,” he said.
He cited the way police officers have historically protected their own in times of crisis, sanitizing what actually transpired.
The original news release from the Minneapolis Police Department on Floyd’s death described the actions of the officers, like this:
The officers “were able to get the suspect in to handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.”
No mention of the knee on his neck. No mention of his cries for help.

Police Handling of Teen At Protest in the Bronx Is Under Investigation: [National Desk]

Full text: Jahmel Leach, 16, was shocked with a stun gun and his face was bloodied as he was taken into custody in the Bronx on June 1.
The pictures on a flier posted online showed a 16-year-old boy in a hospital gown with a long, bloody laceration from his cheek to his chin.
The police handling of the Bronx teenager, Jahmel Leach, who was bruised and shocked with a stun gun during the unrest following George Floyd's death, is now under investigation, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. And the case has become the most recent focus for critics who charge that the New York police have used unnecessary force against some people during the protests.
The police and Jahmel's representatives have given differing accounts of what happened just before 9 p.m. on June 1 at Marion Avenue and East Fordham Road.
A police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing nature of the investigation, said surveillance video captured Jahmel attempting to set fire to rubbish at least five times. A second official said Jahmel was using some kind of liquid to try to start the fire.
The video shows uniformed officers arriving, and one of them firing a Taser at Jahmel, who immediately collapsed, his face striking the pavement, according to the first official. The officers handcuffed him, took him to a precinct station house and then to a hospital shortly afterward, the official said. Jahmel was charged with arson as a juvenile.
But during a news conference Thursday afternoon outside the Bronx's District Attorney's office, the Rev. Kevin McCall, speaking on Jahmel's behalf, said that he was not involved in criminal activity when the officers confronted him.
"He didn't break the law at all," Mr. McCall said. "He was an innocent bystander, watching protesters and he gets assaulted."
Jahmel, who did not speak, appeared in a white T-shirt that read "Justice for Jahmel Leach" and peeled off a black mask to show reporters the still-visible scars on the right side his face. Among others present were his lawyers, Mark David Shirian and Sanford A. Rubenstein, who is well known for taking on the police department; and Jahmel's mother, Daisy Acevedo.
"This has to stop," Ms. Acevedo said. "I demand justice. I will go to my grave until I get it."
During his daily press briefing Thursday morning, the mayor said that the New York Police Department had launched an internal investigation into Mr. Leach's arrest. The Bronx District Attorney's Office and the Civilian Complaint Review Board, a city agency that investigates complaints of misconduct by officers, are also investigating the arrest.
Mr. de Blasio said that he had personally met with the teenager and that he was troubled over the allegation of abuse.
"I met the young man, I met his family," he said. "I'm very concerned."
One action likely to be reviewed is the use of the Taser. The department's policy for electrical weapons like Tasers states they "should only be used against persons who are actively resisting, exhibiting active aggression or to prevent individuals from physically injuring themselves or other person(s) actually present." The policy also discourages officers from using them on children, or in the presence of combustible gases or flammable liquids.
Mr. Shirian, the attorney, said he believed the police mistook Jahmel for an adult because of his large physique; he is over 6 feet tall and over 200 pounds. Mr. Shirian also demanded an outside agency conduct the investigation.
"We can't tolerate this sort of conduct toward children," Mr. Shirian said. "This is unacceptable. The investigation should be done by an independent, third party."
On Wednesday night the schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, also took to Twitter to echo his concerns over the treatment of Jahmel, whom he identified as a public high school student.
"Earlier this month, @NYCSchools student Jahmel Leach sustained significant injuries -- an injured jaw, and cuts, bruises, and swelling all over his body -- allegedly in an incident with the NYPD," Mr. Carranza shared on Twitter. "I am horrified. I know @NYPDNews is now investigating."
In a message under another post on Twitter, Mr. Carranza said that Mr. Leach and his family have the full support of the school system.
"I need to say as loudly and clearly as possible: there is no place for violence against our students," he said. "Period."

Public Advocate Rises As New York Protests Shake Up Mayor's Race: [National Desk]

Full text: New York City's public advocate has become a champion to many of the protesters, raising hopes that he may run for mayor next year.
Eric Adams stood on the steps of Borough Hall in Brooklyn, his office and temporary home, facing a fired-up crowd at a pivotal moment of protest against police violence toward people of color.
As the most prominent black Democratic candidate for mayor, Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, should have had a powerful connection to voters stirred by the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And yet, at this rally on Tuesday, another black elected official threatened to eclipse him: Jumaane Williams, the city's public advocate.
"You all ready for this?" Linda Sarsour, a prominent activist, said to the crowd of hundreds, shortly before they were to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. "When I say 'mayor,' you say 'Jumaane."'
The crowd heartily obliged.
There's just one catch: Mr. Williams, as of now, is not running for mayor in 2021.
"I'm very happy with the job that I have, and I'm going to ask folks to give me another chance," Mr. Williams said in an interview this week, indicating that he was focusing on re-election.
But Mr. Williams's emergence as a sought-after candidate speaks to a surging desire among progressive activists for more options than those offered by the slate of Democratic Party candidates now before them.
"We're trying to use every tool at our disposal to convince him that this is his moment," Ms. Sarsour said.
Sochie Nnaemeka, the New York director of the Working Families Party, said that the protests are leading activists to cast about for alternatives to the existing field, and Mr. Williams's name is one of several that have been floated to the party. She declined to name the others.
"Allies, W.F.P. activists, community leaders have been actively thinking about who in this moment can step up and lead, recognizing that there's a leadership vacuum and there's an absence of accountable leadership, especially on the issues that matter most to us -- invest in our communities, divesting from the police, etc.," Ms. Nnaemeka said.
A key moment emerged at the Brooklyn memorial service for Mr. Floyd last week, when Mr. Williams criticized the governor and mayor for prioritizing the safeguarding of property over protecting black New Yorkers.
"Where is the same energy for black lives?" he said. "Why are you not saying we have to do everything, everything, everything we can to protect black lives?"
Throughout his political career, Mr. Williams has displayed an activist streak: He has been arrested at least a half dozen times while protesting issues such as immigrant rights and President Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
As a New York City councilman, Mr. Williams co-sponsored legislation that helped create an inspector general for the New York Police Department. He then ran a spirited primary campaign for lieutenant governor in 2018, losing to the incumbent, Kathy Hochul, by less than seven percentage points. Months later, he won a special election to succeed Letitia James as the city's public advocate.
Mr. Williams's rise comes at a peculiar time in the mayoral race: For months, the city was locked down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Everyone and everything, including political campaigns, were frozen in place. New Yorkers lost access to jobs, schools, friends.
Then protests erupted, sending thousands of New Yorkers into the streets, filled with pent-up energy and a desire for change. The sometimes violent behavior of Bill de Blasio's police force during the protests only amplified progressive disdain for the mayor, who activists say has failed to live up to his campaign promises.
Now, seven years after Mr. de Blasio ran for office on a pledge to achieve police reforms, New York City's police force is again emerging as a central issue in a mayoral race.
Two of the leading Democratic mayoral candidates, Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, began to criticize Mr. de Blasio for his heavy-handed policing strategy, one that involved officers' using their batons on protesters and employing a herding tactic known as kettling.
Mr. Stringer has called Mr. de Blasio's police response "a fundamental disaster" and demanded he institute sizable cuts to the Police Department budget. Mr. Johnson has been similarly pointed.
Mr. Adams has largely avoided such broadsides, instead delivering a nuanced message, rooted in a law-and-order conservatism born of his 22 years as a New York City police officer.
"No one talks about what Eric has done around these issues," Mr. Adams said. "I'm the invisible man. Ralph Ellison said this years ago. Being a black man is invisible. But I'm on all of these radio stations, I've been leading this conversation, and now people are asking, 'Well, where's Eric?' No, where were they?"
At night, Mr. Adams should be easy to find: He has been sleeping at his office in Brooklyn Borough Hall since the coronavirus pandemic put the city on lockdown. In recent days, Mr. Adams has livestreamed observations of vandalism, spoken about the righteous anger of protesters and has drawn distinctions between peaceful police officers and the actions of their more violent brethren.
His moderate stance may appeal to a broad electorate, but it seems less suited to the current protest environment.
"Particularly when it comes to black elected officials and the N.Y.P.D., they can't just rest on their blackness and ask black communities to trust them," said Anthonine Pierre, deputy director of the Brooklyn Movement Center.
At the Brooklyn memorial service for Mr. Floyd, Mr. Adams spoke after Mr. Williams; after Ms. James, now the state attorney general; after Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat from Brooklyn. He even spoke after Mr. Stringer, who twice referred to George Floyd as "Greg."
When, finally, Mr. Adams got to say his piece, he declared a kinship to victims of police violence rooted in his own personal abuse at the hands of the police.
"Before there was [Ousmane] Zongo, before there was Amadou Diallo, before there was Michael Griffith, before there was Eleanor Bumpurs, before all of that, there were two young boys in South Jamaica, Queens, 15 years old, in the 103rd Precinct, arrested for trespassing," Mr. Adams said.
Mr. Adams recalled how officers took him and his brother into a police house and asked them if they would like a "beat down"; how the officers took them to the basement and kicked them in the groin, again and again; how he urinated blood for seven days.
Three days before the memorial service, Mr. Adams could be found at a much different event outside the 88th Precinct in Brooklyn, where he once worked. The weekend before, two lawyers had been arrested, charged with throwing a Molotov cocktail through the broken window of an empty police car, setting it on fire. Mr. Adams was there to defend the police, and to take a knee.
"We need to separate those who are violent in the protests from the righteous call of dealing with police abuse across our country, and we need to separate those officers who have displayed a high level of violence from those who are doing an amazing job very day," Mr. Adams said. "If we don't want to stereotype every protester, let's not stereotype every police officer."
The protests and the pandemic will undoubtedly continue to shake up the mayoral race. In recent weeks, two white businessmen have hinted at potential mayoral runs: Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, suggested he might make a bid during an interview with The New York Times; John Catsimatidis, a Republican who owns the Gristedes supermarket chain, is considering a run, too.
The second tier of current candidates includes Dianne Morales, a nonprofit executive from the South Bronx; Loree K. Sutton, Mr. de Blasio's former commissioner for veterans services and retired Army brigadier general; and Shaun Donovan, a high-ranking official in the Obama and Bloomberg administrations. (Mr. Donovan also made an appearance at the Tuesday afternoon rally at Brooklyn's borough hall.)
None is getting the attention that Mr. Williams, a noncandidate, has received, as he livestreams protests to an avid Twitter following and contests police actions in real time.
"That's not going to work! Why are we pushing them? Why are we pushing the protesters?" Mr. Williams can be heard asking, on a June 3 video he posted to Twitter showing police officers violently pushing protesters.
The next day, Mr. Williams spoke forcefully at the Floyd memorial in Brooklyn.
"Jumaane has stood out in the crowd," said Ms. Nnaemeka, the Working Families Party official. "People are transfixed by him on social media, on the news and are wondering why is there a disconnect between the leadership that we want and the leadership that we have."

NEW YORK — Eric Adams stood on the steps of Borough Hall in Brooklyn, his office and temporary home, facing a fired-up crowd at a pivotal moment of protest against police violence toward people of color.
As the most prominent black Democratic candidate for mayor, Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, should have had a powerful connection to voters stirred by the protests surrounding the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And yet, at this rally Tuesday, another black elected official threatened to eclipse him: Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate.
“You all ready for this?” Linda Sarsour, a prominent activist, said to the crowd of hundreds, shortly before they were to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. “When I say ‘mayor,’ you say ‘Jumaane.’”
The crowd heartily obliged.
There’s just one catch: Williams, as of now, is not running for mayor in 2021.
“I’m very happy with the job that I have, and I’m going to ask folks to give me another chance,” Williams said in an interview this week, indicating that he was focusing on reelection.
But Williams’ emergence as a sought-after candidate speaks to a surging desire among progressive activists for more options than those offered by the slate of Democratic Party candidates now before them.
“We’re trying to use every tool at our disposal to convince him that this is his moment,” Sarsour said.
Sochie Nnaemeka, the New York director of the Working Families Party, said that the protests are leading activists to cast about for alternatives to the existing field, and Williams’ name is one of several that have been floated to the party. She declined to name the others.
“Allies, WFP activists, community leaders have been actively thinking about who in this moment can step up and lead, recognizing that there’s a leadership vacuum and there’s an absence of accountable leadership, especially on the issues that matter most to us — invest in our communities, divesting from the police, etc.,” Nnaemeka said.
A key moment emerged at the Brooklyn memorial service for Floyd last week, when Williams criticized the governor and mayor for prioritizing the safeguarding of property over protecting black New Yorkers.
“Where is the same energy for black lives?” he said. “Why are you not saying we have to do everything, everything, everything we can to protect black lives?”
Throughout his political career, Williams has displayed an activist streak: He has been arrested at least a half dozen times while protesting issues such as immigrant rights and President Donald Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
As a New York City councilman, Williams co-sponsored legislation that helped create an inspector general for the New York Police Department. He then ran a spirited primary campaign for lieutenant governor in 2018, losing to the incumbent, Kathy Hochul, by less than 7 percentage points. Months later, he won a special election to succeed Letitia James as the city’s public advocate.
Williams’ rise comes at a peculiar time in the mayoral race: For months, the city was locked down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Everyone and everything, including political campaigns, were frozen in place. New Yorkers lost access to jobs, schools, friends.
Then protests erupted, sending thousands of New Yorkers into the streets, filled with pent-up energy and a desire for change. The sometimes violent behavior of Bill de Blasio’s police force during the protests only amplified progressive disdain for the mayor, who activists say has failed to live up to his campaign promises.
Now, seven years after de Blasio ran for office on a pledge to achieve police reforms, New York City’s police force is again emerging as a central issue in a mayoral race.
Two of the leading Democratic mayoral candidates, Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, began to criticize de Blasio for his heavy-handed policing strategy, one that involved officers’ using their batons on protesters and employing a herding tactic known as kettling.
Stringer has called de Blasio’s police response “a fundamental disaster” and demanded he institute sizable cuts to the Police Department budget. Johnson has been similarly pointed.

How the New York Protest Leaders Are Taking On the Establishment [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — A former financial adviser. A makeup artist. A college student who, until the pandemic, worked at a movie theater.
Over the past two weeks, a mix of newly minted activists and more seasoned hands led protests across New York City, directing thousands of marchers across bridges and blocking highways to denounce the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police — and to condemn racism in America.
Their faces are on television. Their images swarm social media. Chivona Newsome, the former financial adviser and a founder of the New York chapter of Black Lives Matter, spoke to thousands of people at a Times Square rally last week. Tenelle Veira, the makeup artist, led a crowd that walked for several miles through Brooklyn.
For five days straight, Djibril Diakite, a Brooklyn College student who until recently worked at a Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, spoke disarmingly on behalf of protesters to police officers, some of whom were clutching batons.
They all identify as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. But even as the protests wrapped up their second week, no one person or organization had emerged as the clear leader in New York.
The decentralized nature of the protests, with different figures popping up to lead crowds day after day around the city, has given the uprising unusual stamina. At the same time, however, it has posed a challenge for elected officials who are aiming to end the demonstrations as the city struggles to reopen after the coronavirus pandemic.
The organization Black Lives Matter has been at the front of some of the marches, along with people who have been affiliated with the National Action Network, the veteran civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton.
But others have also jumped up to lead, including some who said they were driven by their own experiences with the police, like Jamel Mims, 34, an activist with Refuse Fascism, an organization in New York. With a bullhorn in hand, he led a group of protesters as part of a huge demonstration in lower Manhattan last week.
Mims, who had marched against the city’s stop-and-frisk practices, recounted decades of harassment — and worse — at the hands of police in Washington, D.C., New York and Boston, where he said a friend was pepper-sprayed and he was dragged from a party. He said the incident jeopardized a Fulbright award he had to fight to save.
“I had to sit down in front of a panel and explain the pervasive culture of police brutality and how it was something I’ve always had to negotiate with,” said Mims, a rapper who is fluent in Mandarin. “What kind of society is that?”
Many protest organizers are not affiliated with any group. Veira, the makeup artist, planned and led the demonstration for Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician shot by police in her Kentucky home in March, that snaked through Brooklyn. Veira, 29, said she hoped to draw attention to the female victims of police brutality.
At the same time, new groups have formed to give direction to throngs of protesters in their teens and 20s.
Timothy Hunter, 21, who grew up in Brooklyn, and several other student government leaders from New York public colleges created a group called Strategy for Black Lives that locked arms as it led a protest across the Brooklyn Bridge last week.
Like many of his peers, Hunter said that, having grown up in the shadow of the cases of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, he could not sit by when Floyd died.
The younger generation is the first in decades to grow up witnessing both police killings and the rise of a national protest movement in response to them, said Matthew F. Delmont, a professor at Dartmouth College who focuses on African American history. “There’s a sense that this is going to be a turning point,” he said. “They can’t let the intensity go.”
That fervency has proved to be an obstacle for officials trying to restore a greater sense of calm to New York, the nation’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
“If you were to ask anyone who is leading these marches, I’d be surprised if anyone could tell you,” said Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and a former police captain who has been working behind the scenes to get protest leaders to the negotiation table. “It heads to the point of, ‘Where do we go from here?’ We can’t march for the rest of our lives.”
Over the past weekend, while dozens of protests were held across the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to reach an agreement with demonstrators. He turned to a few familiar faces to discuss ideas for police reform, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Garner, and established community and religious leaders.
By Sunday, de Blasio pledged to cut the city’s police budget and spend more on social services — a nationwide demand made by protesters — and he lifted the city’s curfew a day early, citing the peaceful character of the protests. A spokeswoman for de Blasio said he made the changes because “he believed it was the right thing to do.”
Newsome, 35, who founded the New York chapter of Black Lives Matter with her brother, Hawk, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo called a member of her group to negotiate before later announcing he would support the repeal of a law that keeps police disciplinary records secret. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
These announcements, however, have not yet stopped the protests.
“Keep fighting,” Newsome, now a congressional candidate in the Bronx, urged a roaring crowd in Times Square. “Because that’s how things came about in this country.”
In the course of protests, some young demonstrators have defined themselves as leaders by drawing a clear line between protesters and looters. Diakite, 20, the Brooklyn College student and former movie theater worker, directly approached groups of officers. “You need to know that us here,” he told one group. “We are not the same as the ones burning your cars. We are not the ones breaking down windows and burning buildings. They’re infesting our protests.”
Members of Warriors in the Garden, a group created by local 20-somethings who met while protesting, have reminded marchers that it is vital to stay peaceful to preserve the image of the movement.
The protests have had an air of youthful improvisation. Notices go out just hours before the events, posted on dozens of websites and on Instagram accounts. On the ground, protesters carry police scanners and check an app called Telegram for up-to-the-minute information on police activity.
But in fact, many say, while the demonstrations that swept the city and the country appear spontaneous, they are the product of years of grassroots organizing. “It is and it isn’t overnight,” said Soraya Palmer, an organizer at Equality for Flatbush, a group in Brooklyn. Palmer, a 35-year-old writer who grew up in Flatbush, described the unglamorous work that is underpinning the protests, from creating flyers to coordinating with other groups.
While protests at the Barclays Center or outside Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s residence, might get more news coverage, she added, marches held in neighborhoods like Flatbush are also drawing thousands.
Chris Banks, another community organizer, helped stage a huge memorial for Floyd in downtown Brooklyn last week, supplying bullhorns and borrowing some chairs from a day care center in East New York, his Brooklyn neighborhood. The movement, Banks, 36, said, was rooted in the distress of communities like his.
“It’s beyond frustration now,” he said, describing a pattern in which police officers — even when charged with a crime in connection with a killing — received only light sentences. Protests will stop only when people see major policy reforms or new leaders who will hold police more accountable, said Banks, who runs East New York United Concerned Citizens, a social service advocacy group. Leaders at demonstrations have started to raise those topics.
At the end of the second week of protests, the number of individual events seems to have scaled back, but some demonstrations are still drawing large crowds of people. While policy requests may differ slightly, many agree that they want a portion of the police department’s budget redirected toward social programming to support communities, and changes to laws that protect police misconduct.
The policy demands that are now being voiced have not materialized overnight.
After the death of Floyd, Newsome traveled with nine members of her Black Lives Matter group to Minneapolis. She had received a call from the chapter president there asking for support at their demonstrations.
In the hours leading up to their flight, the group drafted a legislative proposal that included a number of goals long sought by activists, including repealing 50-a, the New York law that shields police records from public view; defunding the New York Police Department; disbanding police unions; and banning donations from police unions and individual officers to elected officials.
Less than two weeks later, in a swift turn, lawmakers in New York are already acting on some of those measures. “I feel as though we are on the verge of a revolution,” Newsome said.

NEW YORK — The pictures on a flyer posted online showed a 16-year-old boy in a hospital gown with a long, bloody laceration from his cheek to his chin.
The police handling of the Bronx teenager, Jahmel Leach, who was bruised and shocked with a stun gun during the unrest following George Floyd’s death is now under investigation, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. And the case has become the most recent focus for critics who charge that the New York police have used unnecessary force against some people during the protests.
The police and Jahmel’s representatives have given differing accounts of what happened just before 9 p.m. on June 1 at Marion Avenue and East Fordham Road.
A police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing nature of the investigation, said surveillance video captured Jahmel attempting to set fire to rubbish at least five times. A second official said Jahmel was using some kind of liquid to try to start the fire.
The video shows uniformed officers arriving, and one of them firing a Taser at Jahmel, who immediately collapsed, his face striking the pavement, according to the first official. The officers handcuffed him, took him to a precinct station house and then to a hospital shortly afterward, the official said. Jahmel was charged with arson as a juvenile.
But during a news conference Thursday afternoon outside the Bronx’s District Attorney’s office, the Rev. Kevin McCall, speaking on Jahmel’s behalf, said that he was not involved in criminal activity when the officers confronted him.
“He didn’t break the law at all,” McCall said. “He was an innocent bystander, watching protesters and he gets assaulted.”
Jahmel, who did not speak, appeared in a white T-shirt that read “Justice for Jahmel Leach” and peeled off a black mask to show reporters the still-visible scars on the right side his face. Among others present were his lawyers, Mark David Shirian and Sanford A. Rubenstein, who is well known for taking on the police department; and Jahmel’s mother, Daisy Acevedo.
“This has to stop,” Acevedo said. “I demand justice. I will go to my grave until I get it.”
During his daily news media briefing Thursday morning, the mayor said that the New York Police Department had launched an internal investigation into Leach’s arrest. The Bronx District Attorney’s Office and the Civilian Complaint Review Board, a city agency that investigates complaints of misconduct by officers, are also investigating the arrest.
De Blasio said that he had personally met with the teenager and that he was troubled over the allegation of abuse.
“I met the young man, I met his family,” he said. “I’m very concerned.”
One action likely to be reviewed is the use of the Taser. The department’s policy for electrical weapons like Tasers states they “should only be used against persons who are actively resisting, exhibiting active aggression or to prevent individuals from physically injuring themselves or other person(s) actually present.” The policy also discourages officers from using them on children, or in the presence of combustible gases or flammable liquids.
Shirian, the attorney, said he believed the police mistook Jahmel for an adult because of his large physique; he is over 6 feet tall and over 200 pounds. Shirian also demanded an outside agency conduct the investigation.
“We can’t tolerate this sort of conduct toward children,” Shirian said. “This is unacceptable. The investigation should be done by an independent, third party.”
On Wednesday night the schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, also took to Twitter to echo his concerns over the treatment of Jahmel, whom he identified as a public high school student.
“Earlier this month, @NYCSchools student Jahmel Leach sustained significant injuries — an injured jaw, and cuts, bruises, and swelling all over his body — allegedly in an incident with the NYPD,” Carranza shared on Twitter. “I am horrified. I know @NYPDNews is now investigating.”
In a message under another post on Twitter, Carranza said that Leach and his family have the full support of the school system.
“I need to say as loudly and clearly as possible: there is no place for violence against our students,” he said. “Period.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Cup Foods, near the site of George Floyd’s fatal encounter with the police, is an unassuming store across from a Speedway gas station and Dragon Wok.
The memorial to Floyd at the site is ever expanding. Almost everyone who visits it stops and poses for a selfie. The gathered crowd is a cross section of race and class. Ranay Barton, 18, has been out since the night of Floyd’s death.
“I came out here because I was angry,” she said. “The first thing that ran through my mind was to be mad at white people. When things like this happen, you tend to segregate yourself. But seeing all the support and solidarity calmed me down. All these people are different colors, from different places, coming together for a purpose. I feel like the world should be like that.”
It has become a place to gather and reflect about race.
“We need white people to stand up,” said Lux Thunberg, who, like most people in the neighborhood where she grew up, is black. “We need white people who are not comfortable with racism to talk to those who are.”
Barton worried about whether there would be sustained change.
“If his death doesn’t do anything, the world will fall apart,” she said. “People are fed up. When people are angry, they are unpredictable. Most of the time, nothing happens to the killers. You should never lose your life over a petty crime.”
Buses, cars and discarded shipping pallets were used to block entry to the memorial. A long list of the names of black people killed by police was chalked into the middle of the road. Businesses nearby have started to reopen. DJs set up, and as the sun sets and the day cools, the parking lot of the Speedway gas station across the street turns into a raucous dance party.
But even as the mood has lifted in recent days, the significance and heaviness of the place still dominates.
Barton leaned back on a couch set up under the Speedway gas sign, in an area now known as “George Floyd Square,” and sighed.
“Whenever I see an innocent black man get killed, I see my brother. That could be me,” she said. “I’m tired. We shouldn’t be facing this in 2020.”

NEW YORK — A former financial adviser. A makeup artist. A college student who, until the pandemic, worked at a movie theater.
Over the past two weeks, a mix of newly minted activists and more seasoned hands led protests across New York City, directing thousands of marchers across bridges and blocking highways to denounce the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police — and to condemn racism in America.
Their faces are on television. Their images swarm social media. Chivona Newsome, the former financial adviser and a founder of the New York chapter of Black Lives Matter, spoke to hundreds of people at a Times Square rally last week. Tanelle Veira, the makeup artist, led a crowd that walked for several miles through Brooklyn.
For five days straight, Djibril Diakite, a Brooklyn College student who until recently worked at a Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, spoke disarmingly on behalf of protesters to police officers, some of whom were clutching batons.
They all identify as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. But even as the protests wrapped up their second week, no one person or organization had emerged as the clear leader in New York.
The decentralized nature of the protests, with different figures popping up to lead crowds day after day around the city, has given the uprising unusual stamina. At the same time, however, it has posed a challenge for elected officials who are aiming to end the demonstrations as the city struggles to reopen after the coronavirus pandemic.
The organization Black Lives Matter has been at the front of some of the marches, along with people who have been affiliated with the National Action Network, the veteran civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton.
But others have also jumped up to lead, including some who said they were driven by their own experiences with the police, like Jamel Mims, 34, an activist with Refuse Fascism, an organization in New York. With a bullhorn in hand, he led a group of protesters as part of a huge demonstration in lower Manhattan last week.
Mims, who had marched against the city’s stop-and-frisk practices, recounted decades of harassment — and worse — at the hands of police in Washington, D.C., New York and Boston, where he said a friend was pepper-sprayed and he was dragged from a party. He said the incident jeopardized a Fulbright award he had to fight to save.
“I had to sit down in front of a panel and explain the pervasive culture of police brutality and how it was something I’ve always had to negotiate with,” said Mims, a rapper who is fluent in Mandarin. “What kind of society is that?”
Many protest organizers are not affiliated with any group. Veira, the makeup artist, planned and led the demonstration for Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician shot by police in her Kentucky home in March, that snaked through Brooklyn. Veira, 29, said she hoped to draw attention to the female victims of police brutality.
At the same time, new groups have formed to give direction to throngs of protesters in their teens and 20s.
Timothy Hunter, 21, who grew up in Brooklyn, and several other student government leaders from New York public colleges created a group called Strategy for Black Lives that locked arms as it led a protest across the Brooklyn Bridge last week.
Like many of his peers, Hunter said that, having grown up in the shadow of the cases of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, he could not sit by when Floyd died.
The younger generation is the first in decades to grow up witnessing both police killings and the rise of a national protest movement in response to them, said Matthew F. Delmont, a professor at Dartmouth College who focuses on African American history. “There’s a sense that this is going to be a turning point,” he said. “They can’t let the intensity go.”
That fervency has proved to be an obstacle for officials trying to restore a greater sense of calm to New York, the nation’s epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
“If you were to ask anyone who is leading these marches, I’d be surprised if anyone could tell you,” said Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president and a former police captain who has been working behind the scenes to get protest leaders to the negotiation table. “It heads to the point of, ‘Where do we go from here?’ We can’t march for the rest of our lives.”
Over the past weekend, while dozens of protests were held across the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to reach an agreement with demonstrators. He turned to a few familiar faces to discuss ideas for police reform, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Garner, and established community and religious leaders.
By Sunday, de Blasio pledged to cut the city’s police budget and spend more on social services — a nationwide demand made by protesters — and he lifted the city’s curfew a day early, citing the peaceful character of the protests. A spokeswoman for de Blasio said he made the changes because “he believed it was the right thing to do.”
Newsome, 35, who founded the New York chapter of Black Lives Matter with her brother, Hawk, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo called a member of her group to negotiate before later announcing he would support the repeal of a law that keeps police disciplinary records secret. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
These announcements, however, have not yet stopped the protests.
“Keep fighting,” Newsome, now a congressional candidate in the Bronx, urged a roaring crowd in Times Square. “Because that’s how things came about in this country.”
In the course of protests, some young demonstrators have defined themselves as leaders by drawing a clear line between protesters and looters. Diakite, 20, the Brooklyn College student and former movie theater worker, directly approached groups of officers. “You need to know that us here,” he told one group. “We are not the same as the ones burning your cars. We are not the ones breaking down windows and burning buildings. They’re infesting our protests.”
Members of Warriors in the Garden, a group created by local 20-somethings who met while protesting, have reminded marchers that it is vital to stay peaceful to preserve the image of the movement.
The protests have had an air of youthful improvisation. Notices go out just hours before the events, posted on dozens of websites and on Instagram accounts. On the ground, protesters carry police scanners and check an app called Telegram for up-to-the-minute information on police activity.
But in fact, many say, while the demonstrations that swept the city and the country appear spontaneous, they are the product of years of grassroots organizing. “It is and it isn’t overnight,” said Soraya Palmer, an organizer at Equality for Flatbush, a group in Brooklyn. Palmer, a 35-year-old writer who grew up in Flatbush, described the unglamorous work that is underpinning the protests, from creating flyers to coordinating with other groups.
While protests at the Barclays Center or outside Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s residence, might get more news coverage, she added, marches held in neighborhoods like Flatbush are also drawing thousands.
Chris Banks, another community organizer, helped stage a huge memorial for Floyd in downtown Brooklyn last week, supplying bullhorns and borrowing some chairs from a day care center in East New York, his Brooklyn neighborhood. The movement, Banks, 36, said, was rooted in the distress of communities like his.
“It’s beyond frustration now,” he said, describing a pattern in which police officers — even when charged with a crime in connection with a killing — received only light sentences. Protests will stop only when people see major policy reforms or new leaders who will hold police more accountable, said Banks, who runs East New York United Concerned Citizens, a social service advocacy group. Leaders at demonstrations have started to raise those topics.
At the end of the second week of protests, the number of individual events seems to have scaled back, but some demonstrations are still drawing large crowds of people. While policy requests may differ slightly, many agree that they want a portion of the police department’s budget redirected toward social programming to support communities, and changes to laws that protect police misconduct.
The policy demands that are now being voiced have not materialized overnight.
After the death of Floyd, Newsome traveled with nine members of her Black Lives Matter group to Minneapolis. She had received a call from the chapter president there asking for support at their demonstrations.
In the hours leading up to their flight, the group drafted a legislative proposal that included a number of goals long sought by activists, including repealing 50-a, the New York law that shields police records from public view; defunding the New York Police Department; disbanding police unions; and banning donations from police unions and individual officers to elected officials.
Less than two weeks later, in a swift turn, lawmakers in New York are already acting on some of those measures. “I feel as though we are on the verge of a revolution,” Newsome said.

NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio waded into a resurgent national debate over the legacy of the Civil War on Thursday, calling on military officials to rename a street at an Army base in Brooklyn named after Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general and its military leader.
“His name should be taken off everything in America, period,” de Blasio said at a news briefing.
The mayor’s comments came as the city has faced weeks of protests demanding a reckoning over institutional racism and systemic bias, part of a national movement touched off by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Included in that larger conversation has been the revival of a long-running and difficult discussion over Confederate tributes.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump fueled the debate when he publicly criticized the Pentagon for considering renaming 10 Army bases named after Confederate officers who fought against the U.S. military to defend the slaveholding South in the Civil War.
“The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars,” Trump wrote over a number of tweets. “Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.”
New York — a Northern stronghold of abolitionists but one that historically benefited from the brutal business of slavery — has had far fewer Confederate memorials than places in the South. In 2017, a number of busts and plaques honoring Confederate figures were taken down across the city, part of a wave of monument removals taken down after a white nationalist rally that turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia.
But the Fort Hamilton Army base in southern Brooklyn near Bay Ridge, which is overseen by the military and not by local officials, still has two roads named after Southern generals: General Lee Avenue, named after Lee, and Stonewall Jackson Drive, named for Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson.
Fort Hamilton, an Army garrison that was named for Alexander Hamilton and built between 1825 to 1831, is the only active military installation in the city. Both the Army Corps of Engineers and the Army Reserve have offices there, and the post is home to a battalion that recruits soldiers from New York City, Long Island and Westchester County.
Lee served at Fort Hamilton from 1841 to 1846, when he was stationed there as an Army engineer.
De Blasio on Thursday said that while he did not have jurisdiction over Fort Hamilton, he would appeal to military leadership to strip the base’s streets of their Confederate legacy.
“Anything named after him has to go in this city,” de Blasio said of Lee.
J. Phillip Thompson, a deputy mayor under de Blasio who was also at Thursday’s news briefing, also expressed his support for the mayor’s position, saying that the issue hit close to home for him because he was descended from people who were enslaved on Lee’s plantation.
“This issue is an emotional issue for many people like me,” Thompson said. “And it’s really hard for us to really feel fully part of this country that celebrates our enslavement with names like that on military bases all across this country.”
A Pentagon spokesman referred questions to the White House, where a spokesman declined to comment.
Later on Thursday, the mayor of Albany issued an order for the removal of a statue in front of City Hall depicting Philip Schuyler, a Revolutionary War general and a slave owner whose son-in-law was Alexander Hamilton.
“It has become clear that now is the time to act and confront the unfortunate history of our nation,” the mayor, Kathy Sheehan, said in a statement.
De Blasio’s remarks about Lee followed a letter sent by two of New York’s congressional representatives — Max Rose and Yvette D. Clarke, both Democrats who represent parts of Brooklyn — to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper that called on the Army to rename the streets.
In the letter, which was reported earlier Thursday by The Daily News, Rose and Clarke criticized Trump’s tweets.
They also told Esper that it was “impossible to disentangle these men’s identities as individuals from the cause they rebelled against our nation to defend” and that the military should not “honor men who divided this country to defend slavery.”
Instead, Rose and Clarke urged Esper to rename the streets in Brooklyn after African American heroes who fought to uphold American values, including equality.
“U.S. military bases and property should be named after men and women who’ve served our nation with honor and distinction, not sought to tear it apart to uphold white supremacy,” the letter said. “And American servicemembers deserve to serve on bases that honor their ancestor’s contributions to our nation, not those who fought to hold those same ancestors in bondage.”
Clarke had been among a number of local lawmakers who pressed the Army to make a similar move in 2017. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo later endorsed their views, writing a letter to the then-acting secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy.
At the time, the Army declined to rename the streets, saying in a letter that doing so would be “controversial and divisive.”
An Army spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

NEW YORK — When New York City became the national epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, its once-sacrosanct practice of sorting thousands of children into selective public schools suddenly collapsed: The metrics that dictate admissions evaporated as schools shuttered.
Then, the city erupted in protest over the killing of George Floyd, and the fact that the proudly progressive city is home to one of the nation’s most racially divided school districts took on fresh urgency.
New York is now inadvertently running an experiment in how to operate without high-stakes admissions screens. Some hope that a looming decision on how schools will admit students into top schools this fall could lead to integration long after the pandemic ends and the protests ebb.
The city has “an opportunity to zoom back out to 40,000 feet and think about whether this system we’ve created over the last few decades serves the system and its students well,” said Stefan Lallinger, a fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation and the grandson of civil rights leader Louis L. Redding. “I would argue that it doesn’t.”
An admissions system that was built up over the last 20 years fell apart in a matter of weeks.
Even before schools closed their doors in March, some parents kept their children home as the virus began spreading, and the mayor nixed attendance as a measure of student achievement for the current admissions cycle. Shortly after, state standardized tests were canceled and letter grades were put on hold for most students.
That sudden shift has stirred fear and frustration among some parents who have warned of calamity if screened admissions are overhauled long term.
But other families and even Department of Education staffers say change is long overdue, even if it was prompted by two tragedies.
Over 400 department employees, most of them people of color, signed a letter calling on Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza to scrap most admissions screens and exams, along with other major changes.
“This is the moment to dissociate ourselves from institutional racism and to affirm that Black Lives Matter,” reads the letter, which was written as protests against police brutality swelled in New York.
Carranza has said he believes screened admissions are contrary to the spirit of public education and drew ire from his many critics after his recent remarks that the city should “never waste a good crisis to transform a system” were reported by the New York Post.
The admissions process has endured despite the fact that elite public schools have enrolled dwindling numbers of black and Hispanic students, prompting mounting frustration from educators and parents.
And the process has remained largely unchanged even during the tenure of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who promised to vanquish inequality in city life but has not made school desegregation a priority.
New York City screens more children for admissions than any school district in the country; about a third of the city’s roughly 900 middle and high schools use some kind of requirement for admissions, typically including attendance, grades, test scores, schoolwork and sometimes interviews and recommendations. A small number of schools use demographic requirements aimed at creating diverse student populations.
Tens of thousands of rising sixth- and ninth-graders spend months and sometimes years touring schools, pulling together applications and studying for exams in the hope of securing a coveted seat. Manhattan’s Beacon High School, for example, received over 5,800 applicants for 360 ninth-grade slots last year.
Critics say that the process is inherently unfair because it privileges children whose families have the time and money to navigate the complex system and pay for test preparation or consultants, and that it discriminates against qualified but low-income black and Hispanic students.
The screening system produces selective schools that are largely attended by white and Asian American students, though the city’s school system is mostly black and Hispanic.
In recent weeks, a debate over how to restructure admissions for the fall — and far beyond — has reached a fever pitch.
Brad Lander, a City Councilman from Brooklyn, said the city should announce a temporary admissions system for this fall and work to create permanent changes over the next year. “But it would also be foolish to double down and recommit to a set of systems that we already knew weren’t working well,” he said.
Lander helped lead an effort to eliminate selective admissions for middle schools in his district, which now uses a ranked lottery system. He and others said that other districts should stop sorting young children by academic ability.
“Trying to decide a 9-year-old’s worth completely makes no sense,” said Emma Rehac, a high school senior who is part of the group IntegrateNYC.
Screening for the city’s gifted and talented programs starts even earlier: Children can take a test for those highly competitive programs when they are just 4.
Critics of the admissions process have argued that attendance for young children in particular is more a reflection of parents’ ability to get their children to school than of students’ credentials.
And some elementary school principals have said students come to school sick in an effort to maintain perfect attendance records — which would be a public health violation in the wake of a global pandemic.
“I don’t think attendance should ever come back” as an admissions screen, said Laura Zingmond, the editor of Insideschools.org.
Some of the most selective schools have long held in-person tours, drawing thousands of parents who start lining up on sidewalks early in the afternoon — making it difficult for low-income and working families to attend. The virus may render those events obsolete, and the city may use virtual open houses to address both safety and equity concerns.
Zingmond said the city should also delay its usual admissions cycle, which typically begins at the start of the school year. “The last thing anyone needs to think about in September is admissions. Schools will have traumatized kids and teachers.”
But Elissa Stein, a local schools consultant, said her inbox is flooded with parents who believe disruptions to the usual admissions process could damage their children’s academic prospects.
“In this very stressful time when we are all undergoing new levels of anxiety, to have this whole system ripping apart in front of our eyes and not having an answer or even some direction is causing an outrageous amount of stress,” she said.
The city’s admissions system has spawned a cottage industry of tutors and consultants; Stein charges $240 an hour for meetings.
In a statement, Carranza said the city is currently holding virtual town halls to solicit feedback from parents and promised that the city’s ultimate decision will “properly account for the unprecedented disruption this pandemic has had in the lives of our children.”
The loudest opposition to admissions changes has come from families in one of the city’s wealthiest and highest-performing school districts, Manhattan’s District 2.
Jude Listanowsky, a seventh-grade student who lives in the district, created a Change.org petition calling on the mayor to restore the previous grading system for the upcoming high school admissions season.
During remote learning, middle-schoolers either pass classes or receive remedial help for incomplete courses rather than receiving letter grades.
“We will have no motivation to perform to our best during this time of COVID,” his petition, which has garnered over 1,800 signatures, reads.
Parent Leaders for Accelerated Curriculum and Education, a group that supports gifted and talented schools and screened admissions, has been encouraging families to write to the mayor and chancellor to register their concerns.
A form letter on the group’s website accuses the city of “deliberately and cynically using the deadly COVID-19 crisis to enact an agenda that I oppose and about which my voice has not been heard.”
“In this environment that’s been created, achievement is a dirty word,” said Lucas Liu, a PLACE founder.
There is legitimate debate about the value of screening, said Sean Corcoran, a professor at Vanderbilt University who has studied New York’s idiosyncratic admissions. “What is the instructional reason we have these screens?” he asked.
Corcoran said the city should consider eliminating all screens for the coming admissions cycle and then create a more standardized system under which all schools have to use similar, publicly available requirements, more of which should be aimed at boosting integration. He warned of a counterproductive scenario in which individual schools create their own admissions screens if the city does not act soon.
Many educators and parents believe the city can do much more than merely skirt a worst-case option.
Eric Goldberg, an elected parent leader in Manhattan, said the mayor should “send a message to the families and students who have fought and waited for reform, and to those marching in the streets, that our schools must reflect our values.”
And Lallinger said that transforming admissions should no longer be seen as an unwinnable political fight.
“There’s a lot of fearmongering and falling into historical ways of thinking about the potential consequences of changing the demographics of a school,” Lallinger said. “This is 2020, not 1953. That’s where I’d start.”

WASHINGTON — The country’s top military official apologized Thursday for taking part in President Donald Trump’s walk across Lafayette Square for a photo op after authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the area of peaceful protesters.
“I should not have been there,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a prerecorded video commencement address to National Defense University. “My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.”
His first public remarks since Trump’s photo op, in which federal authorities attacked peaceful protesters so that the president could hold up a Bible in front of St. John’s Church, are certain to anger the White House, where Trump has spent the days since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis taking increasingly tougher stances against the growing movement for change across the country.
On Wednesday, the president picked another fight with the military, slapping down the Pentagon for considering renaming Army bases named after Confederate officers who fought against the Union in the Civil War.
The back and forth between Trump and the Pentagon in recent days is evidence of the deepest civil-military divide since the Vietnam War — except this time, military leaders, after halting steps in the beginning, are now positioning themselves firmly with those calling for change.
Trump’s walk across Lafayette Square, current and former military leaders say, has started a critical moment of reckoning in the military.
“As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from,” Milley said. He said he had been angry about “the senseless and brutal killing of George Floyd,” and repeated his opposition to Trump’s suggestions that federal troops be deployed nationwide to quell protests.
Milley’s friends said that for the past 10 days, he has been agonized about appearing — in the combat fatigues he wears every day to work — behind Trump during the walk across Lafayette Square, an act that critics said gave a stamp of military approval to the hard-line tactics used to clear the protesters.
The general believed that he was accompanying Trump and his entourage to review National Guard troops and other law enforcement personnel outside Lafayette Square, Defense Department officials said.
In the days after the photo op, Milley told Trump that he was angered by what had happened. The two had already exchanged sharp words June 1 when Milley engaged the president in a heated discussion in the Oval Office over whether to send active-duty troops into the streets, according to people in the room.
Milley argued that the scattered fires and looting in some places were dwarfed by the peaceful protests and should be handled by the states, which command local law enforcement.
Trump acquiesced, but he has continued to hold out the threat of sending active-duty troops.
Last week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper called a news conference to announce that he, too, opposed invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty troops across the country to quell protests, a line that a number of U.S. military officials said they would not cross.
The president, aides say, has been furious with both Esper and Milley since then. Defense Department officials say they are unsure how long either will last in their respective jobs, but they also note that Trump can ill afford to go into open warfare with the Pentagon so close to an election.
Since last Monday, Milley has spoken with lawmakers, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, both Democrats. He has also spoken with many of his predecessors as well as with Republican congressional leaders, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. In most of the exchanges, Milley said he deeply regretted the park incident.
A combat veteran who peppers his speech with references to the history of warfare, Milley has usually gotten along with Trump, mixing banter and bluntness when he speaks to his boss, officials say. The general went against the wishes of his own father — who fought at Iwo Jima as a Marine — when he joined the Army.
In the tumultuous hours and days since the walk across Lafayette Park, Milley has taken pains to mitigate the damage. Two days after the episode, Milley released a letter that forcefully reminded the troops that their military was supposed to protect the right to freedom of speech. He added a handwritten codicil to his letter, some of it straying outside the margins: “We all committed our lives to the idea that is America — we will stay true to that oath and the American people.”
During his speech Thursday at National Defense University, Milley, after expressing his disgust over the video of the killing of Floyd, spoke at length about the issue of race, both in the military and in civilian society.
“The protests that have ensued not only speak to his killing but also to the centuries of injustice toward African Americans,” he said. “What we are seeing is the long shadow of our original sin in Jamestown 401 years ago, liberated by the Civil War but not equal in the eyes of the law until 100 years later in 1965.”
Milley called on the military to address issues of systemic racism in the armed forces, where 43% of the enlisted troops are people of color, but only a tiny handful are in the ranks of senior leadership.
“The Navy and Marine Corps have no African Americans serving above the two-star level, and the Army has just one African American four-star,” he said, referring to officers who are generals and admirals. “We all need to do better.”

Federal Arrests Show No Sign That Antifa Plotted Protests [With graphic(s)]

Inciting a riot. Hurling a Molotov cocktail. Plotting to sow destruction. Those are some of the most serious charges brought by federal prosectors against demonstrators at protests across the country in recent weeks.
But despite cries from President Donald Trump and others in his administration, none of those charged with serious federal crimes amid the unrest have been linked so far to the loose collective of anti-fascist activists known as Antifa.
A review of the arrests of dozens of people on federal charges reveals no known effort by Antifa to perpetrate a coordinated campaign of violence. Some criminal complaints described vague, anti-government political leanings among suspects, but the majority of the violent acts that have taken place at protests have been attributed by federal prosecutors to individuals with no affiliation to any particular group.
Even so, Attorney General William Barr has blamed Antifa for orchestrating the mass protests, which broke out across the country following the death in police custody of George Floyd.
“There is clearly some high degree of organization involved at some of these events and coordinated tactics that we are seeing,” Barr said. “Some of it relates to Antifa; some of it relates to groups that act very much like Antifa.”
Trump has sought to expand and exploit accusations against what he has called the involvement of “radical leftists” in the protests. At one point the president said that Antifa would be declared a “terrorist organization,” although it is not a single organization, nor does any U.S. law allow using that designation against a domestic group. On Tuesday, the president suggested on Twitter, without providing any evidence, that a 75-year-old Buffalo, New York, protester hospitalized after being knocked down by police could be “an ANTIFA provocateur.”
Trump and other Republicans have also sought to raise campaign funds off the unsubstantiated accusations. “Stand with President Trump against antifa!” read a banner advertisement on Trump’s reelection campaign website this week.
Marjorie Green, a congressional candidate in Georgia, produced a campaign ad showing her armed with an AR-15 military-style rifle and threatening Antifa activists.
“You won’t burn our churches, loot our businesses or destroy our homes,” she said.
Asked why the myriad criminal complaints do not single out Antifa, Barr said on Fox News this week that preliminary charges do not require linking suspects to a particular group, adding that there was “a witches’ brew of extremist groups that are trying to exploit this situation on all sides.”
FBI agents and federal prosecutors have pursued charges aggressively against rioters, looters and others accused of wreaking havoc during the demonstrations. Law enforcement officials have relied on a variety of federal statutes to make arrests, including conspiracy to commit arson, starting a riot, civil disorder and possession of a Molotov cocktail.
The most serious case that has emerged in federal court involved three men in Nevada linked to a loose national network of far-right extremists advocating for the overthrow of the U.S. government. They were arrested May 30 on charges of trying to foment violence during Black Lives Matter protests.
Given the sheer volume of thousands of arrests nationwide in recent weeks, officials cautioned that many investigations remain in the early stages, with investigators still trying to determine affiliations. In addition, state and local court documents are far harder to search comprehensively.
However, interviews with several major local police departments and a review of hundreds of newspaper stories about arrests around the country revealed no evidence of an organized political effort behind the looting and other violence.
“We saw no organized effort of Antifa here in Los Angeles,” said Josh Rubenstein, spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
Asked in an interview about the involvement of Antifa or other extremists groups in Minneapolis, Medaria Arradondo, chief of police, said, “As I sit here today, I have not received any sort of official information identifying any of the groups.”
In the one example where Antifa is mentioned, local police in Austin, Texas, said members of the Red Guards, a Maoist organization, were involved in organizing the looting of a Target store. The Red Guards have been associated with Antifa protests in Austin in the past, but local activists said they were largely estranged from the group.
While anarchists and anti-fascists openly acknowledged being part of the massive crowds, they call the scale, intensity and durability of the protests far beyond anything that they might dream of organizing. Some tactics used at the protests, like the wearing of all black and the shattering of store windows, are reminiscent of those used by anarchist groups, say those who study such movements.
In Portland, Oregon, those affiliated with Rose City Antifa said they have supported the continuing protests. But the city’s Antifa actions have long involved a wide range of people, some who dress in black apparel and face coverings and others who show up in everyday clothing to decry far-right extremists and police militarization. There has also been various far-left activities in Seattle, including people who have spray-painted anarchist symbols on public property.
Antifa has roots in the Occupy Wall Street protests of a decade ago and the demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. During Trump’s inauguration, Antifa activists marched in Washington vandalizing businesses and at one point setting fire to a limousine.
Over the next several months, its followers disrupted events hosted by right-wing speakers like Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulous. When the far-right fought back, organizing its own public protests, anti-fascist activists met them on the streets in what often turned into violent confrontations, culminating in the bloody rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Anarchists and others accuse officials of trying to assign blame to extremists rather than accept the idea that millions of Americans from a variety of political backgrounds have been on the streets demanding change. Numerous experts called the participation of extremist organizations overstated as well.
“A significant number of people in positions of authority are pushing a false narrative about Antifa being behind a lot of this activity,” said J.M. Berger, author of the book “Extremism” and an authority on militant movements. “These are just unbelievably large protests at a time of great turmoil in this country, and there is surprisingly little violence given the size of this movement.”
In July, Christopher Wray, the FBI director, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the agency “considers Antifa more of an ideology than an organization.”
In Las Vegas, the complaint filed in U.S. District Court said the three suspects called themselves members of the “boogaloo,” which is described as a far-right movement “to signify a coming civil war and/or fall of civilization.”
At an initial protest, the three strapped on bulletproof vests, grabbed their rifles and waded into the crowd, hoping to provoke clashes between protesters and police, according to court papers. One taunted police officers, yelling in their faces, while a second chided protesters “that peaceful protests don’t accomplish anything and they needed to be violent,” the complaint said.
When that failed, they plotted to blow up an electric substation along the route of the demonstration in the hope that would prompt more violence between police and protesters, according to the complaint. They were arrested after preparing Molotov cocktails from gasoline and lemonade bottles before a march.
Robert Drascovich, an attorney for one of the accused, Stephen Parshall, 35, said his client denied all the charges.
Individual associated with the boogaloo movement have been out in force at countless demonstrations in the past few years, clad in their distinctive combat dress and armed with rifles. They often claim that they appear armed in public to underscore their commitment to Second Amendment rights or to protect local businesses.
But online, boogaloo discussion groups overflow with racist statements and threats to exploit any unrest to spark a race war that will bring about a new government system.
In Denver, police seized a small arsenal including three assault rifles, numerous magazines, several bulletproof vests and other military paraphernalia from the car trunk of a self-professed “boogaloo” adherent headed toward a protest, a man who had previously livestreamed his own support for armed confrontations with police.
After a demonstration in Athens, Georgia, on May 31 ended with the National Guard being called in and tear gas fired to clear protesters away from the gates of the University of Georgia, Chief Cleveland Spruill wrote a lengthy memo spelling out his concerns around extremist involvement in the protests.
Given the volatile mix of protesters, including armed men, he said, he feared a repeat of Charlottesville. Some participants called such fears overblown given the overall peaceful tenor of the protest.
In New York, police briefed reporters May 31, claiming that radical anarchists from out of state had plotted before the protests by setting up encrypted communications systems, arranging for street medics and collecting bail funds.
Within five days, however, Dermot Shea, the city’s police commissioner, acknowledged that most of the hundreds of people arrested at the protests in New York were actually New Yorkers who took advantage of the chaos to commit crimes and were not motivated by political ideology. John Miller, the police official who had briefed reporters, told CNN that most looting in New York had been committed by “regular criminal groups.”
In Austin, court documents said several members of the Red Guards participated in burglarizing a Target store, including a woman who streamed the event on Facebook Live, encouraging people to come “even if you do not want to loot,” one affidavit said.
Although the court documents identified the Red Guards as part of the city’s anti-fascist umbrella organization, several Austin activists described the group as either defunct or estranged from one another because of their penchant for troubling acts like laying a dead cat on the doorstep of a business involved in a gentrification dispute.
Kit O’Connell, a longtime radical leftist activist and community organizer in Austin, said that shortly after Trump’s election, the group took part in anti-fascist protests in the city against a local white supremacist group and scuffled separately with Act for America, an anti-Muslim organization.
“They’ve been an influence at the protests, but they’re not in charge; no one’s really in charge,” O’Connell said.
Carl Guthrie, a lawyer for Samuel Miller, one of those charged with burglary, denied that his client had any connection to the Red Guards. He called such accusations “a transparent, incendiary attempt to distract from the problems plaguing our society: systemic racism and state-sponsored murder.”
Experts on extremism said the few suspects arrested with overt political goals fall under the broad category of “accelerationists,” groups that hope to exploit any public unrest to further their own anti-government goals.

SEATTLE — On the streets next to a police precinct in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, protesters and officers spent a week locked in a nightly cycle of standoffs, at times ending with clouds of tear gas.
But facing a growing backlash over its dispersal tactics in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, the Seattle Police Department this week offered a concession: Officers would abandon their precinct, board up the windows and let the protesters have free rein outside.
In a neighborhood that is the heart of the city’s art and culture — threatened these days as rising tech wealth brings in gentrification — protesters seized the moment. They reversed the barricades to shield the liberated streets and laid claim to several city blocks, now known as the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.”
“This space is now property of the Seattle people,” read a banner on the front entrance of the now-empty police station. The entire area was now a homeland for racial justice — and, depending on the protester one talked to, perhaps something more.
What has emerged is an experiment in life without the police — part street festival, part commune. Hundreds have gathered to hear speeches, poetry and music. On Tuesday night, dozens of people sat in the middle of an intersection to watch “13th,” the Ava DuVernay film about the criminal justice system’s impact on African-Americans. On Wednesday, children made chalk drawings in the middle of the street.
One block had a designated smoking area. Another had a medic station. At the “No Cop Co-op,” people could pick up a free LaCroix sparkling water or a snack. No currency was accepted, but across the street, in a nod to capitalism, a bustling stand was selling $6 hot dogs. It was dealing in U.S. dollars.
On Wednesday night, President Donald Trump tried to portray the scenes in the city as something more sinister. He called for government leaders to crack down on the protesters, declaring on Twitter that “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle.”
“Take back your city NOW,” Trump wrote in a tweet directed at Mayor Jenny Durkan and Gov. Jay Inslee. “If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game.”
Durkan responded with a tweet of her own: “Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker.”
The protest zone has increasingly functioned with the tacit blessing of the city. Harold Scoggins, the fire chief, was there Wednesday, chatting with protesters, helping set up a call with the police department and making sure the area had portable toilets and sanitation services.
“I have no idea where we’re headed,” Scoggins said in an interview. “We’ve been working step by step on how to build a relationship, build trust in small things, so we can figure this out together.”
The demonstrators have also been trying to figure it out, with various factions voicing different priorities. A list of three demands was posted prominently on a wall: One, defund the police department; two, fund community health; and three, drop all criminal charges against protesters.
But on a nearby fence, there was a list of five demands. Online was a list of 30.
While Floyd’s death in Minneapolis drove most of the energy in the streets toward ending police violence and racial injustice, some of those here in recent days have pushed for a wider focus. Some of the messages mirror the 2011 Occupy movement and seemed aimed at targeting corporate America for its role in social inequities.
“The more we encourage and focus on the race thing, the greater our attention is not focusing on the fact that this is class warfare,” said a 28-year-old protester and self-described anarchist who identified himself only by his first name, Fredrix.
On Tuesday night, Kshama Sawant, a City Council member affiliated with the Socialist Alternative Party, led protesters down to City Hall, holding a gathering inside the building in which she promoted her plan to tax Amazon, which is headquartered in the city.
But some of those who mobilized here over race and policing have begun to worry that these broader priorities could cloud the agenda at a time when vital progress for African-Americans seemed within reach.
“We should focus on just this one thing first,” said Moe’Neyah Dene Holland, 19, a Black Lives Matter activist. “The other things can follow suit. Because honestly, black men are dying and this is the thing we should be focusing on.”
The city prepared for the possibility that the street demonstrations could linger. On Wednesday, a team from the Seattle Department of Transportation came through and hoped to remove some of the orange barriers — including one marked with the message “People’s Republic of Capitol Hill” — and replace them with planter boxes filled with coral bells and other plants to give the new pedestrian zone an air of permanence.
But when the crews went to remove the barriers, some of the protesters objected. The crew stood down, and Rodney Maxie, a deputy director at the transportation department, told his team they might return later, after further talks with the demonstrators.
“This is good practice for the 9.0 earthquake,” he told his team.
The protesters also had differing opinions about how long the autonomous zone would last. Some wondered if the police department would try to reclaim the territory. Others said they expected the barriers to be up for weeks, until state and city leaders had done enough to meet their demands.
John Moore, 23, said he hoped to see the autonomous zone become legally recognized. Moore wore a stethoscope and paramedic apparel in a makeshift health center set up on the patio of a taco restaurant. The medic team was looking for a more permanent space to provide health services, and Moore said they had dozens of people with a range of qualifications, from CPR certifications to experience in a Level 1 trauma center.
Moore said the experiment in a place without police could work.
“We are trying to prove through action and practice that we don’t need them and we can fulfill the community’s needs without them,” he said.

NEW YORK — Riot helmets, ballistic vests, shields, batons — fully decked-out police officers have become staples in New York City as the protests against racism and police brutality approach their third week. But increasingly, one piece of equipment has attracted attention with its absence: the face mask.
On any given day, any corner, any group of officers, some or all of them are not wearing masks. Others wear them below their chin. With masks having become as ingrained as shirts and shoes in the vast majority of New Yorkers’ wardrobes, their widespread absence on the police is striking — and to a mayor and governor still fighting the coronavirus pandemic, troubling.
“Police officers should be wearing masks,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference in Manhattan on Monday. Likewise, Mayor Bill de Blasio, on his call-in appearance on WNYC on Friday, was asked why officers were unmasked.
”I’m frustrated by it, too,” he said. “The policy is police officers are supposed to wear face coverings in public, period.” But he noted that compliance is far from universal: “It has not been happening consistently. I have had this conversation with Commissioner (Dermot) Shea multiple times. It has to be fixed and that bothers me.”
While police officers may forgo mask-wearing for any number of reasons, from peer pressure within ranks that are loath to change to a desire to more easily communicate, the images have fueled a perception of the police as arrogant and dismissive of protesters’ health — perhaps even at the peril of their own.
And while several officers have conspicuously knelt down with or hugged people at rallies, the widespread failure to use masks is creating a more standoffish look, one that protesters say suggests that the police operate above the rules — one of the very beliefs motivating the nationwide movement.
“If you’re out here to protect the public, it starts with you,” said Chaka McKell, 46, a carpenter who attended a protest in Downtown Brooklyn on Monday. “The head sets the example for the tail.”
The official New York Police Department policy is that officers should wear masks when interacting with the public. But in a statement Wednesday, the department dismissed the criticism about the lack of masks as petty.
“Perhaps it was the heat,” Sgt. Jessica McRorie of the department’s press office said in a statement. “Perhaps it was the 15-hour tours, wearing bullet resistant vests in the sun. Perhaps it was the helmets. With everything New York City has been through in the past two weeks and everything we are working toward together, we can put our energy to a better use.”
Skipping personal protection may come with a cost. The city is still reporting hundreds of new coronavirus cases each week, and more than 40 members of the Police Department have died of COVID-19, the police said. Just days ago, Shea announced the virus-related death of Chief William Morris, who led the transportation division.
As of May 29, the most recent date that numbers were made available, 901 uniformed members of the department — about 2.5% of the total number — were out sick, down from 19.8% at its peak in April. As of that same date, 5,627 members of the department had returned to work after testing positive for the coronavirus.
Then the protests began, putting the officers, working in large crowds, in the spotlight. The new questions arise during what seems, from the outside, to be an evolving relationship between officers and protective masks. In the early days of the coronavirus’s arrival in the region, with cases seemingly few and isolated, officers for the most part set the masks aside, with the encouragement of their leaders.
On March 20, with the city moving toward a quarantine — bars and restaurants had closed three days earlier — Shea was asked at a news conference about officers without masks.
“That could very well be a good thing, quite frankly,” he said. “We’re trying to conserve the use of these and use them where appropriate. And I think the medical professionals would tell us that, generally speaking, it’s better to have the masks on the people that are sick as opposed to officers walking around in the street.”
Not long after, though, the governor made masks mandatory for all New Yorkers. Since April 17, anyone visiting an indoor location or unable to maintain social distancing must wear a mask — a striking period of 54 days and counting, perhaps indefinitely for many.
And so, the sight of maskless officers, at gatherings that are protesting police behavior nationwide, rankles some.
A Twitter account, @nypdmaskwatch, has posted photographs of officers without masks, including their names and badge numbers.
At a rally Monday outside Brooklyn’s Borough Hall, 11 of the 13 police officers near one section of the crowd wore masks, with the other two having pulled them down below their chins. But around the corner stood 12 officers, only three wearing masks.
At the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge stood 38 officers and captains. Eight wore masks, some below the nose, while 14 wore them below their chins and 16 wore none.
Asked about the masks, officers mostly declined to comment or ignored the question. One officer who was confronted about the matter by a young man in Brooklyn on Saturday responded, “We’ve got more important things to deal with.”
One captain who was walking alongside protesters without wearing a mask seemed to suggest the decision falls to the individual officer in the situation at hand.
“The focus is staying at peace with the protesters,” said the captain, who declined to give his name since he had no authorization to speak with the news media. “This isn’t the ideal scenario, but we’re doing the best we can. Ideally, officers wear their masks, they take precautions and they stay safe, but our priority right now is the protest and the protesters.”
Crista Simiriglia, the manager of the band Sunflower Bean, who was passing out Gatorades from the back of their touring van at a nearby demonstration, was struck by the lack of police masks. “It was very startling and very dangerous,” she said.
A musician in the band, Julia Cumming, 24, said she was surprised whenever she sees an officer wearing a mask. “I’ve come to expect them not to,” she said. “It’s just very strange. I’m generally confused. They’re supposed to give this sense of authority.”

Over the last two days, sportswear giant Adidas has made several promises to black employees.
The company said that 30% of new hires would be black or Latino. It pledged to fund 50 university scholarships a year for black students over the next five years. And in an employee call Wednesday, Zion Armstrong, president of Adidas in North America, said the company would expand funding for programs that address racial disparities to $120 million over the next five years.
But for some black employees, missing from all of the pronouncements this week was what they had been pushing for internally: an acknowledgment by company executives that Adidas had a problem with racism and discrimination, and an explicit apology for that treatment.
Late Wednesday afternoon, some black employees felt vindicated when Adidas put up a statement on Instagram, saying the company would be nothing without “Black athletes, Black artists, Black employees and Black consumers.”
“We’ve celebrated athletes and artists in the Black community and used their image to define ourselves culturally as a brand, but missed the message in reflecting such little representation within our walls,” the social media post said.
The tone on a call among 130 mostly black employees inside the company shortly after the social media post went up was celebratory, according to several people on the call, coming after what had been a particularly tumultuous period. But it did not totally satisfy everyone.
“It did acknowledge us and did own up a bit, but to me it is a devastating miss not to just say sorry,” said Kevin Wright, an Adidas gaming employee.
The unrest inside Adidas began two weeks ago when many black employees and their supporters were frustrated by the public response of the company, which has its global headquarters in Germany, to the protests rippling across the world following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died while a white police officer knelt on his neck.
Dozens of employees ceased working and instead attended daily protests held outside of the company’s North American headquarters in Portland, Oregon. Others posted on social media, detailing their experiences with discrimination in the workplace and arguing that the company’s words — its public anti-discrimination stance — did not match its actions.
A coalition of mostly black employees worked through the weekend with white leadership in Portland, creating a set of goals and a plan for achieving them.
Believing they were close to achieving a breakthrough, members of the coalition even drafted a statement this week for the company’s board of directors in Germany to sign off on. It included an acknowledgment of its problems with racism and would offer an official apology.
Instead, the company released a statement Tuesday that said 30% of new hires would be black or Latino and pledged to invest in scholarships for black students and programs that benefited the black community, but omitted any references to internal discrimination, angering many employees. On Wednesday’s call, Armstrong expanded on Tuesday’s statement but offered no corporate apology.
Adidas declined to comment beyond its statements.
The unrest inside Adidas may have followed the global protests, but many black workers have long felt discriminated against by their employer and disillusioned with the company’s leadership.
Last year, The New York Times found that in 2018 only 4.5% of the 1,700 employees on the Portland campus identified themselves as black, and only about 1% of the more than 300 of the worldwide vice presidents were black. Black employees often felt marginalized and sometimes discriminated against by the largely white executives in Portland. Two employees said they were referred to with a racist slur by white co-workers.
Adidas’ internal struggles with race run counter to its outward embrace of black culture and sports, particularly through its high-profile partnerships with entertainers like Beyoncé, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams and athletes, including NBA stars James Harden and Damian Lillard. Those relationships have translated into sales among black and Hispanic youth for Adidas.
“It is sad when this company is fueled by the culture outside, but inside there is a limitation on black talent because we are only good for that information extracted,” said Aric Armon, an Adidas footwear designer.
On Tuesday, the company banned the use of the word “asset” when referring to people, including sponsored athletes and entertainers, noting the word is offensive to cultures that have been enslaved. The announcement slide included a picture of Harden, noting “You are an athlete, not an asset.”
Frustration inside the company rose at the end of last month.
On May 29, Nike posted a 60-second video on its social media accounts that implored, “Don’t pretend there’s not a problem in America.” The next day, Adidas retweeted Nike’s social media campaign.
The company scrambled to come up with its own response. Later that day Reebok, a Boston-based footwear company owned by Adidas, posted on social media that, “Without the black community, Reebok would not exist.” Two hours later, Adidas put its statement on Instagram: an image of the word “Racism” crossed out. It was not well-received inside the company.
Adidas, aware of growing unrest among employees, said that June 2 would be a “Day of Reflection” and that employees should not have any meetings that day.
Julia Bond, who joined the company last year as an assistant apparel designer, used part of the day to write a letter to executives in Portland, asking for an apology for the racism and discrimination that she says has been “enabled and perpetuated” at the company.
The next day, Bond emailed her letter to Adidas leadership in North America. That afternoon, she began reaching out to the news media, taking her letter and story public.
“Adidas likes to keep it really quiet,” Bond said. “Keep it anonymous. I decided it was time to put a face to this problem. But it was very frightening and quite daunting to do that.”
Inspired by Bond, Armon sent a letter to his bosses detailing his experience with a white co-worker who used a racial slur. He also posted it publicly on Instagram.
“This is the time to stop it,” he said. “There is momentum like there has never been before. I want to make sure this brand is better after I leave than when I got in.”
While Adidas began holding company calls about racism and discrimination, a coalition of about a dozen mostly black employees inside the company put together a 32-page presentation that included a list of demands. It called for more diversity among employees and investment in the black community, along with timelines for when they should be accomplished.
Another group of employees made plans to strike until their demands were met. Some employees refused to work Friday and Monday, and others began a daily noon protest outside the company’s Portland offices — the first time many employees had seen one another in person in months because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Adidas executives in Portland, including Armstrong, began communicating with the coalition of employees who put together the presentation about its demands. Over the weekend, the two sides tried to formulate how to best bring about real, significant change inside Adidas.
The results of those meetings were sent to the Adidas board in Germany, while discussions and negotiations in Portland continued through Monday evening. Members of the employee group believed they were on the cusp of having many of their demands met and that they would finally see Adidas apologize and pledge to improve.
They were left disappointed by Tuesday’s announcement by Adidas and Wednesday’s statement by Armstrong.
But the mood shifted once again with Adidas’ posting Wednesday. Many saw it as a hard-won victory, a big step by the company to admitting the problem.
But others said something was still missing.
“This is a great first step,” said Aaron Ture, a product manager for footwear at Reebok who is biracial and has worked for Adidas for three years. Ture also wrote a letter to the company in recent days about his experiences and concerns with the company. “But we can only start to build this future once we have sorted out the past.”

A day after George Floyd was laid to rest during an impassioned service calling for broad corrections to racial injustice, his brother Philonise Floyd testified Wednesday before a House hearing on police accountability and racial bias in law enforcement, and offered lawmakers a wrenching plea for change.
“I’m here to ask you to make it stop,” said Philonise Floyd, the first and most central witness to testify at the hearing. More than half a dozen civil rights experts and activists also spoke.
“George’s calls for help were ignored,” he told the House Judiciary Committee, recalling how his brother gasped that he could not breathe while pinned under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer for nearly nine minutes May 25.
“Please listen to the call I’m making to you now, to the calls of our family, and to the calls ringing out in the streets across the world,” he said. “People of all backgrounds, genders and race have come together to demand change. Honor them, honor George and make the necessary changes that make law enforcement the solution — and not the problem.”
Moved to tears as he recounted how his brother had continued to address the officers detaining him as “sir” as he lay dying, Floyd alluded to the reason police were summoned that day: a complaint that someone had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.
“I am asking you, is that what a black man’s life is worth?” Floyd said. “Twenty dollars? This is 2020. Enough is enough.”
The hearing’s subject is the sweeping legislation proposed by Democrats that would be the most expansive federal intervention into law enforcement in recent memory. It comes amid a groundswell of public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, with widespread protests in big cities and small towns alike.
The shift in public opinion during an election year has sent Republicans scrambling to create their own policy proposals. Senate Republican leaders announced that Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Republican senator who is African American, would lead a legislative push to address racial discrimination and police brutality.
The announcements reflect mounting political urgency. House Democrats have indicated that they intend to act quickly, with a vote on their legislation by the end of the month.
Wednesday’s hearing included remarks from Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer who represents the family of George Floyd.
House Republicans invited Dan Bongino, the conservative political commentator and former Secret Service agent; and Angela Underwood Jacobs, whose brother, Dave Patrick Underwood, a Federal Protective Services officer, was shot and killed late last month during a night of unrest in Oakland, California.

Trump Smears A Protester, 75, Hurt in Buffalo: [National Desk]

Full text: The president attacked Martin Gugino even as the activist was in the hospital recovering from a head wound sustained when the police shoved him to the ground.
It is true, his friends admitted: Martin Gugino is an activist, a seasoned peacenik who in a lifetime of protest has taken part in demonstrations against military drones, climate change, nuclear weapons and police brutality.
But Mr. Gugino is also a football fan, they said, a mild-mannered bachelor and a Buffalo native who returned to his hometown some years ago to care for his ailing mother.
The one thing he is not, however, those who knew him said, is what President Trump suggested he was on Twitter Tuesday morning: a wily Antifa provocateur.
Mr. Trump's tweet -- none of it backed by fact -- raced across the internet all day even as Mr. Gugino, 75, still lay in the hospital, recovering from the serious head wound he sustained on Thursday night when two Buffalo police officers shoved him to the ground at a demonstration marking the police killing of George Floyd.
A cellphone video of the encounter has now been seen by millions of people and led to charges being filed against the officers on Saturday.
In the video, a tall and lanky Mr. Gugino can be seen in front of the police with what seems to be a cellphone in his hand. Two of the officers shove him and he falls backward, cracking his head against the ground. As blood seeps out of his right ear, several officers walk by him.
The president's tweet on Tuesday, which appeared to accuse Mr. Gugino of having instigated or even faked the encounter, was not the first time Mr. Trump has sought to blame Antifa -- a word that describes a loose collective of anti-fascist activists -- for encouraging what has now become nearly two weeks of nationwide demonstrations.
The president and his allies have often tried to place anti-fascists and other "outside agitators" at the center of the protests as a way to delegitimize them and to deflect from the fact that the vast majority of the demonstrations have been peaceful.
But even by his own standards, Mr. Trump appeared to test the boundaries of credulity by trying to brand a retired septuagenarian computer programmer as a follower of Antifa, whose adherents are, for one thing, generally much younger.
Some Antifa activists, practicing a tactic called Black Bloc, have been known to dress like ninjas and wear masks or balaclavas during protests while shattering windows and scuffling with the police.
Near Buffalo, however, the idea that Mr. Gugino was one of them struck many as absurd.
"Antifa? Oh, heavens no," said Judy Metzger, 85, a longtime friend who lives near Mr. Gugino in Amherst, a suburb of the city. "Martin is a very gentle, a very pleasant person."
Born in Buffalo, Mr. Gugino spent most of his working life in Cleveland, where he specialized in creating computer databases, his friends and colleagues said.
He went back to his hometown to care for his mother, and after she died, he lived alone in her home, finding fellowship at the Western New York Peace Center and at other parts of the city's close-knit left-wing activist community.
John Washington, 35, first met Mr. Gugino at an Occupy Buffalo event in 2011 when both men took to the streets of Niagara Square, the same place where Mr. Gugino was shoved by the police last week.
Mr. Washington was immediately struck by the older man's vitality and youthful demeanor, and by his command of issues that ranged from energy efficiency to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay.
"He has this kind of thirst for justice," Mr. Washington said. "He gets very latched onto powerful ideas and tries to really experience them, not just learn them."
Nate Buckley, a co-owner of the Burning Books bookstore on Connecticut Street in Buffalo, said that Mr. Gugino was a regular customer who often came to hear the speakers in the shop -- everyone from figures in the Catholic Worker Movement to Princeton University professors lecturing on race.
"Martin is interested in everything -- he's a very inquisitive person," Mr. Buckley said. "He's also a very social person with an active mind who's always asking questions."
Mr. Buckley said he was disturbed that Mr. Gugino -- "a 75-year-old elder," as he put it -- had effectively been tarred as a thug by Mr. Trump and his supporters.
"He's one of the most gentle people I know," Mr. Buckley said. "He's not aggressive at all. But people make up the most insane stories so they don't have to deal with reality."
Mr. Trump's tweet seems to have been based on a report by One America News Network, a right-wing cable television channel, which claimed that Mr. Gugino had been trying to knock out the police officers' radios with his cellphone -- an idea that several of Mr. Gugino's friends dismissed as ludicrous.
One America News, based in San Diego, was founded in 2013 by Robert Herring, a California businessman who made a fortune in the technology industry. The network rallied behind Mr. Trump in the 2016 presidential election, and its coverage increasingly shifted to cheerleading on behalf of the president and his administration.
Other conspiracy theories have surrounded Mr. Gugino in recent days on social media, among them that the blood seen leaking from his ear on the video was fake.
Hours after the tweet was posted, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lashed out at Mr. Trump, saying that he should "apologize" and "show some humanity." Mr. Cuomo said the tweet was "all made up," adding that he was shocked the president would accuse Mr. Gugino of being an anti-fascist plant without any evidence.
"You think the blood coming out of his head was staged?" Mr. Cuomo asked, sounding incredulous. "How reckless, how irresponsible."
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also denounced the president's tweet at a virtual fund-raiser Tuesday night with Senator Kamala Harris of California, noting that Mr. Trump tweeted "while George Floyd was being buried."
"Did you see that? I mean, my lord. What have we become if we abide by this? So much we can do and must do," Mr. Biden said.
Even some congressional Republicans questioned the post.
Senator Mitt Romney told reporters on Tuesday he thought the tweet was "shocking." Senator John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said, "It's a serious accusation, which should only be made with facts and evidence, and I haven't seen any yet."
At the end of May, Mr. Trump announced -- again on Twitter -- that he intended to designate Antifa as "a terrorist organization." There were, however, two problems with the declaration: The federal government can only designate foreign-based groups as terrorist entities, and anti-fascism is a political idea, like pacifism or communism, not an organization.
With tens of thousands of people marching across the country, it is all but impossible to accurately determine how many Antifa activists have taken part in the protests. But it is definitely clear that they are not playing a leading role in the protests.
Terrence Bisson, a mathematics professor who has known Mr. Gugino for a decade, mostly through the Western New York Peace Center, said his friend would remain in the hospital for weeks. Mr. Gugino was still in a delicate condition, disturbed by bright lights and unable to move his head without tremendous pain, he said.
Sage Green, a former program manager at PUSH Buffalo, a local activist group, said the last time she saw Mr. Gugino was early in the spring when he was asked to critique the presentations of some students in an environmental studies class at the University at Buffalo.
"He was there giving feedback almost in a grandfatherly way," Ms. Green recalled. "He was telling them they were all doing great work."
In Ms. Green's mind, Mr. Gugino was never without a smile on his face or an offer of help on his lips. He could also be astonishingly nerdy, she said, obsessed with wonky subjects like household utility budgets.
But now Mr. Gugino had become something he rarely wanted to be: the center of attention.
"Martin is a piece of the larger story," Ms. Green said. "All he was doing was going out there to fight for black lives. And that's something he should be able to do without being targeted as a provocateur."
Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

Entangled in the Trauma of Police Brutality: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: MoCA Cleveland has apologized to the artist Shaun Leonardo, whose charcoal drawings represent victims of police violence.
The artist Shaun Leonardo has accused the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland of censorship after it canceled an exhibition of his charcoal drawings of police killings of black and Latino boys and men.
The show, "The Breath of Empty Space," which includes images of Eric Garner, Walter Scott and Freddie Gray, was to open last week. In the drawings, the victims are sometimes hazy, a blur, or a void: Rodney King appears as a white blank surrounded by officers. Mr. Garner is shown in a chokehold. Another drawing depicts the Cleveland park where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed.
The museum canceled the exhibition, organized by the independent curator John Chaich, in March after local black activists and some of the museum's staff members objected to it. The museum shared a statement with the artist that said that "troubling community response" made the institution realize that "we were not prepared to engage with the lived experiences of pain and trauma that the work evokes."
The museum's director, Jill Snyder, described the complaints she was hearing -- namely, that "this work stirs the trauma back up for the very community that it is intending to reach, and also that there is a way in which institutions like MoCA put that pain and trauma on display disrespectfully and somewhat gratuitously -- that there is a performative aspect to our presentation of it."
In an email to his followers on June 6 revealing the cancellation, Mr. Leonardo, 40, who has shown his work at institutions throughout the United States, and created community-based arts programs in New York, responded.
"I must make it clear that I was never given the opportunity to be included in outreach, and therefore, never had a moment to engage any community member regarding the show," wrote Mr. Leonardo, who identifies as Afro-Latino.
"What has become evident to me," he said, "is that after grave mishandling of communication regarding the exhibition, institutional white fragility led to an act of censorship."
On Sunday, Ms. Snyder posted a lengthy public apology to Mr. Leonardo on the museum's website, which reads, in part: "I would like to acknowledge our failure in working through the challenges this exhibition presented together with Mr. Leonardo. In doing so, we failed the artist, we breached his trust, and we failed ourselves." It concludes, "The work of anti-racism involves taking responsibility and supporting risk. We did not do this. We failed. We are learning now."
Ms. Snyder, who said the museum has undertaken diversity initiatives in the past, added that she wished that she had invited the artist into the conversation and engaged a broader African-American constituency. In subsequent conversations "with civic leaders and other members of the community," she said, she heard "with difficulty and tough love, that the black community is not monolithic, that we should have sought other voices."
Earlier this year, "The Breath of Empty Space" was exhibited without incident at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore -- a community scarred by the death of Freddie Gray, 25, in police custody in 2015. Mr. Leonardo's works also include "The Eulogy," in which he delivers remarks about Trayvon Martin and other black men and boys who have been killed, accompanied by a band playing a New Orleans funeral march. It was performed in 2017 on the High Line in New York.
The Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland did not share the names of the critics, but in an interview, Mr. Leonardo said that he had "become aware that those views against my work are not representative of a larger black community's perspective."
"What I take the most offense to," he said, is that the museum leadership "was using my work to create the opening for the dialogue that should have been happening in the first place."
Mr. Leonardo said the reason he was speaking out now, months after the show was canceled, "was in reflection of what I saw as empty messaging coming out of primarily white art institutions since the death of George Floyd." For example, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles apologized for a May 31 Instagram post calling for "equity and fairness" that did not mention Black Lives Matter or Mr. Floyd by name.
Since the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, Mr. Leonardo, a Queens-born artist, has focused on social justice art, dealing with issues like the numbers of black and Latino men in prison, racial inequality, police use of force. "I Can't Breathe" is a self-defense workshop where participants learn how to escape the chokehold that killed Mr. Garner, as Mr. Leonardo tells them that police will interpret self-defense as resisting arrest. In "Primitive Games," enacted at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2018, Mr. Leonardo staged a nonverbal performance that brought together four groups with conflicting views on the debate over guns in America.
In the last three years, museums have become flash points for debates about racial justice after displaying artworks by white artists that address subjects like violence against African-Americans. Protests erupted over a painting based on a photograph of Emmett Till (at the Whitney Biennial in 2017) and a sculpture evoking the hanging of Dakota Indians (at the Walker Art Center the same year).
Since then, museums have sought to rebuild good will with people in the communities who feel their most painful stories are not for white artists, and museums whose leadership is overwhelmingly white, to tell. The conflict over the Cleveland exhibition reveals that even if the work is by an artist of color, an institution needs to do the proper outreach first to lay the groundwork for a sensitive show.

Dancing Amid the Pain: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Some came to the streets to dance. Others were moved to dance more spontaneously, and surprised to find themselves seen by millions online.
As protesters streamed through the streets of New York on Sunday afternoon, one group's chants of "Black lives matter!" and "No justice, no peace!" gave way to a sound more often heard at weddings and block parties. On 125th Street in Harlem, hundreds of people, many of them professional dancers, had congregated for a peaceful march across town and a collective performance of the Electric Slide.
The sea of grapevining, step-touching demonstrators, who filled a plaza near Malcolm X Boulevard, had been called together by two New York dancers, Sheen Jamaal, 27, and Alison Bedell, 24 (also known as Buttons). The event, Dance for George, paid tribute to George Floyd and called attention to the work of black artists at the heart of the dance and entertainment industries. Every so often the jostling line dance would reshape itself into a circle, with dancers freestyling at the center as the packed crowd cheered them on. (A mix of "Electric Boogie" spliced with hip-hop and R&B classics had been prepared for the occasion.)
The alternately euphoric and somber gathering -- after the dancing came a silent, nine-minute kneel -- is just one instance of dance intersecting with protest over the past two weeks of global demonstrations against racism and police brutality. Widely shared videos have shown a rendition of the Cupid Shuffle on the streets of Newark; an offering of bomba, an Afro-Puerto Rican tradition, from a young protester in Loíza, Puerto Rico; and a jingle dress dance, a healing practice rooted in Ojibwe culture, performed in Minneapolis as a prayer for Mr. Floyd's family
Scroll through social media, and you might also find twerking in New Orleans, Senegalese Sabar in Los Angeles and the Haka (an ancient Maori war dance) in New Zealand, all proclaiming through the body that black lives matter. The examples are so abundant that one hip-hop dancer and scholar, MiRi Park, has created a public Google document listing occurrences of dance as protest since May 26, together with further reading on the subject. It expands every day.
At the center of many of these videos are dancers expressing pain and joy -- affirming that they are alive. Some came to the streets with the purpose of dancing. Others were moved to dance more spontaneously, and surprised to find themselves seen by millions online. Dancers from three cities, featured in three videos, spoke about what it has meant to them to dance in protest.
New York: A brotherly moment
At a march in Lower Manhattan last week, three men who had never met were drawn to the same drumbeat. Fabricio Seraphin, Nathan Bunce and Areis Evans had gathered around a group of musicians, and during a pause in the procession, they broke into dance. A video of their exuberant, unplanned dance circle -- recorded and shared on Instagram by another protester, Antoinette Henry -- has now been viewed well over two million times.
In phone interviews, Mr. Seraphin, Mr. Bunce and Mr. Evans said they were not dancing with cameras in mind. "It all came together naturally," said Mr. Bunce, 47, an artist and teacher who lives in Brooklyn. "It was a big release for me."
Each dancer brought a distinctive style to the circle. Mr. Bunce said he was paying homage to New York's underground house scene, while invoking Haitian, South African and West African traditions of honoring ancestors through dance -- or as he put it, "speaking to those that were here before me."
Mr. Seraphin, 25, a contemporary dancer and circus artist living in Brooklyn, added ballet to the mix, with an ecstatic grand jeté that translated the words on his T-shirt -- "black boy joy" -- into movement. For him, joy is a form of resistance.
"You can take from us, but you cannot take our joy," he said. "That is ours to give, ours to do with what we please."
Mr. Evans, 33, a fitness and hip-hop instructor who lives in Harlem, described expressing joy and pain at once. In his emphatic solo, he did not hold back. "I was in tears," he said. "The way my style is, I really want people to see the hurt."
He tapped into these feelings with the support of strangers. "I saw three black men actually come together; we didn't judge each other," he said. "It was a brotherly moment, and I loved that."
Chicago: A vogueing intervention
One night last week, Karma Munez, a dancer in Chicago's vogueing ballroom scene, proposed an idea to two of her best friends: to dress up, find a protest and vogue in the streets. The next day, the three put on their thigh-high black boots, grabbed their speakers and joined a march in the city's Bronzeville neighborhood.
The results have circulated in numerous videos online, in which the dancers fearlessly strut, spin, kick and dip, letting their bodies crash to the pavement, as other protesters cheer them on. In one moment, Ms. Munez (who also goes by Gorgeous Mother Karma Gucci, her ballroom name), dances in front of a row of police cars, flipping her hair in front of their flashing lights.
"I thought it was the best way to make a stand with the talent that we have," said Dhee Lacy (a.k.a. Adonte Prodigy), when the trio got together for a FaceTime interview a few days later. "I didn't want to have to riot, and I think that ultimately people have different ways of speaking out."
With its origins in black and Latino, gay and transgender communities, vogueing has always been a mode of resisting oppression. The dancers said that through their street performance, they were advocating for black L.G.B.T.Q. people, who are sometimes pushed to the margins of the Black Lives Matter movement. "We wanted to stand up for ourselves, as well," said Amya Jackson (a.k.a. Amya Mugler), pointing to the brutal attack of a transgender woman, Iyonna Dior, by a group of black men during a recent Minneapolis protest. "What about us?"
Ms. Munez noted that some online viewers mistook the performance to be celebratory. "I feel like people misunderstand dancing, and they automatically assume that if I'm dancing, I'm happy," she said. "Dance is not a celebration; it's an expression."
Minneapolis: Solidarity across cultures
The group known as Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli, which practices Mexican Nahua dance, song and drumming, is a frequent presence at Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Its dancers first took to the streets in solidarity with the movement after the death of Jamar Clark, who was shot and killed by Minneapolis police in 2015.
"An injustice to one of us is an injustice to all," said Sergio Cenoch, who directs the group with his wife, Mary Anne Quiroz, when the two spoke by phone just before a vigil for Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis. "That's the message we want to convey when we're out there supporting."
A recent video posted on Instagram by a Kalpulli member, Samuel B. Torres, shows the dancers in bright regalia, kneeling outside the Fifth Precinct of the Minneapolis Police Department. After leading protesters in a chant of "George Floyd! Say his name!" they leap to their feet to an accelerating drum beat.
"One of the dances that we do a lot is called Tletl, which is fire," Mr. Cenoch said. "We do that to spark fire and have it be felt across everybody that is watching, to try to get them connected to what is going on, and get that fire within their soul lit."
Ms. Quiroz added that the dances they bring to protests "have survived colonization, have survived over 500 years." To keep them alive "is a symbol of resistance," she said, noting the connections between the struggles of black and Indigenous people. "It's a symbol of resilience."

Hace casi 30 años Floyd tenía grandes planes para su vida. Su muerte a manos de la policía impulsa un movimiento en contra de la brutalidad policial y la injusticia racial.

HOUSTON — Era el último día del penúltimo grado de bachillerato en la Escuela Preparatoria Jack Yates de Houston, hace casi tres décadas. De camino a casa, un grupo de buenos amigos iba pensando lo que traería el último año escolar y lo que vendría incluso más adelante. Eran adolescentes negros a punto de alcanzar la mayoría de edad. La pregunta que se planteaban unos a otros era: ¿Qué querían hacer con su vida?
“George me miró y dijo: ‘Quiero emocionar al mundo’”, comentó Jonathan Veal, de 45 años, al recordar las aspiraciones de uno de esos jóvenes, un destacado atleta, alto y sociable, llamado George Floyd, a quien había conocido en la cafetería de la escuela el día que comenzaron el sexto año. En sus mentes de 17 años, la idea de emocionar al mundo tal vez significaba la NBA o la NFL.
[ Sigue nuestra cobertura en vivo, en inglés, de las protestas por la muerte de George Floyd ]
“Fue uno de los primeros momentos que recordé después de enterarme de lo que le sucedió”, dijo Veal. “Floyd no podría haberse imaginado que esta sería la manera trágica en que la gente conocería su nombre”.
Ahora la gente conoce a George Perry Floyd Jr. por sus desgarradores momentos finales, cuando suplicaba que lo dejaran respirar mientras la rodilla de un policía presionaba su cuello durante casi nueve minutos en una calle de la ciudad de Mineápolis.
La muerte de Floyd, inmortalizada en el video que tomó en su celular una persona que pasaba por el lugar durante el atardecer del Día de los Caídos, ha desatado dos semanas de manifestaciones que se han extendido por todo Estados Unidos en contra de la brutalidad policiaca. Ha sido conmemorado en Mineápolis, donde murió; en Carolina del Norte, donde nació, y en Houston, donde miles de personas hicieron fila de pie bajo el calor implacable del lunes en la tarde para pasar junto a su ataúd dorado y darle el último adiós en la ciudad en la que pasó la mayor parte de su vida.
Muchos de los que asistieron a esta despedida pública dijeron que veían a Floyd como uno de ellos: un vecino de Houston que podía haber sido su padre, su hermano o su hijo.
“Esto fue algo que sentimos muy de cerca”, afirmó Kina Ardoin, una enfermera de 43 años que estaba formada en una fila que llegaba hasta muy lejos de la entrada de la iglesia. “Podría haber sido cualquiera de mi familia”.
Ahora que es una fecha marcada en la larga historia de violencia contra las personas negras, el asesinato de Floyd ha hecho que manifestantes de todas las razas marchen por las calles y se arrodillen coreando “¡Las vidas negras importan!” en cientos de ciudades y pueblos pequeños.
No obstante, Floyd, de 46 años, fue más que el video gráfico de su muerte de casi nueve minutos. Fue más que las dieciséis frases registradas en la grabación en las que dice de varias formas “No puedo respirar”.
Fue un hombre corpulento que tenía sueños muy grandes y que no se desanimó por los tropiezos de su vida.
Después de crecer en uno de los barrios más pobres de Houston, se distinguió como basquetbolista y futbolista, y completó tres pases para avanzar 18 yardas en un juego de campeonato estatal en su penúltimo año de bachillerato.
Fue el primero de sus hermanos en ir a la universidad gracias a una beca de deporte. Pero después de un par de años, regresó a Texas y pasó casi una década entre arrestos y encarcelamientos por delitos relacionados principalmente con las drogas. Para cuando salió definitivamente de su pueblo natal hace algunos años y se mudó a trabajar a Mineápolis, a unos 2000 kilómetros, estaba listo para comenzar de nuevo.
Cuando viajó a Houston en 2018 para el funeral de su madre —murieron con dos años y una semana de diferencia—, le dijo a su familia que había comenzado a sentir que Mineápolis era su hogar. Se hizo tatuar el nombre de su madre en el abdomen, un dato que se registró en la autopsia.
La vida en Bricks
Floyd nació en Fayetteville, Carolina del Norte, y fue hijo de George Perry y Larcenia Floyd, pero en realidad creció en un barrio de Houston llamado Bricks.
Luego de que sus padres se separaron, su madre se mudó con él y sus hermanos a Texas, donde creció en el mundo de ladrillos rojos de Cuney Homes, un complejo de 564 viviendas públicas ubicado en el tercer distrito de Houston nombrado en honor a Norris Wright Cuney, uno de los hombres negros políticamente más poderosos del estado a fines del siglo XIX.
La madre de Floyd —conocida como Cissy— era una lideresa de Cuney Homes y era integrante activa de la junta de vecinos. Crio a sus hijos y, en ocasiones, también a algunos de sus nietos e hijos de sus vecinos.
De niño, en Bricks, lo conocían como Perry, su segundo nombre. Cuando creció, también creció la cantidad de sobrenombres. Era el Gran Floyd, conocido tanto por su gran personalidad como por su sentido del humor.
La altura de Floyd —en el colegio medía más de 1,80 metros — creó una especie de mística.
“Imagínate a este chico alto como estudiante de primer año de secundaria caminando por los pasillos. Pensamos: ‘¿Quién es ese tipo?’. Era un bromista, siempre estaba riéndose y hacía chistes”, dijo Herbert Mouton, de 45 años, quien jugó en el equipo de fútbol americano de la secundaria Yates con Floyd. “Estábamos hablando el otro día con un compañero de clases tratando de pensar si Floyd había estado antes en una pelea. Y no pudimos recordarlo”.
Mouton dijo que después de perder un juego importante, Floyd dejaba que el equipo se pusiera de mal humor por unos minutos antes de contar un chiste para aligerar el estado de ánimo. “Nunca quería que nos sintiéramos mal por mucho tiempo”, dijo.
Floyd vio en los deportes un camino para salir de Bricks. Y fue así que, en un estado obsesionado con los deportes, se valió de su talla y destreza atlética. Jugando como ala cerrada, Floyd ayudó a llevar a su equipo de fútbol americano a la final del campeonato estatal en 1992.
En un emocionante momento que quedó grabado en video —y que ha circulado después de su muerte— Floyd se eleva por encima de un oponente en la zona final para atrapar un pase de anotación.
Después de graduarse del bachillerato, Floyd se fue de Texas con una beca de básquetbol al South Florida Community College (ahora llamado South Florida State College).
“Yo buscaba un ala-pívot que fuese alto y él cumplía con los requisitos. Era atlético y me gustaba cómo manejaba el balón”, dijo George Walker, quien reclutó a Floyd. “Era titular y anotaba de doce a catorce puntos y lograba de siete a ocho recuperaciones de balón”.
Floyd fue transferido dos años después, en 1995, al campus de Kingsville de la Universidad de Texas A&M, pero no se quedó mucho tiempo ahí. Regresó a Houston —y al tercer distrito— sin titularse.
Conocido a nivel local como el Tré, el tercer distrito, al sur del centro de la ciudad, es históricamente uno de los vecindarios negros de Houston y ha sido representado en la música de una de las personas más famosas que han crecido ahí: Beyoncé.
La vida en Bricks era despiadada en ocasiones. La pobreza, las drogas, las pandillas y la violencia atemorizaban a muchas familias del tercer distrito. Muchos de los compañeros de escuela de Floyd no cumplieron más de veintitantos años.
Poco después de regresar, Floyd comenzó a rapear. Apareció con el nombre de Big Floyd en cintas creadas por DJ Screw, un personaje de la escena hip-hop de Houston en la década de 1990. Con voz profunda y rimas intencionalmente lentas, Floyd rapeaba sobre autos con llantas de gran tamaño y el orgullo de pertenecer al tercer distrito, su barrio.
Según los registros del tribunal y de la policía, Floyd fue arrestado varias veces en Houston, a lo largo de un periodo aproximado de diez años que comenzó cuando tenía veintitantos. Una de esas detenciones, por una transacción de diez dólares relacionada con drogas en 2004, lo llevó a pasar diez meses en una cárcel estatal.
Cuatro años después, Floyd se declaró culpable de robo agravado a mano armada y pasó cuatro años en prisión. Lo liberaron en 2013 y regresó a casa, esta vez para empezar el largo y difícil camino de intentar cambiar su vida. Usó sus errores como una lección para otras personas.
Stephen Jackson, un jugador profesional de básquetbol jubilado de Port Arthur, Texas, conoció a Floyd un año o dos antes de unirse a la NBA. Tenían en común los deportes, dijo Jackson, pero también se parecían lo suficiente como para llamarse de cariño “gemelo” el uno al otro.
“Le digo a la gente todo el tiempo que la única diferencia entre George Floyd y yo, la única diferencia entre mi gemelo y yo, la única diferencia entre Georgie y yo, es el hecho de que yo tuve más oportunidades”, dijo, y luego agregó: “Si George hubiera tenido más oportunidades, podría haber sido atleta profesional en dos deportes”.
Luego de salir de prisión, Floyd se dedicó todavía más a su iglesia. Inspirado por su hija, Gianna Floyd, quien nació después de que fue liberado, Floyd pasaba mucho tiempo en Resurrection Houston, una iglesia que celebra muchos de sus servicios en una cancha de basquetbol ubicada en el centro de Cuney Homes. Colocaba las sillas y arrastraba hasta el centro de la cancha la figura principal del servicio: la pila bautismal.
“Bautizábamos a las personas en la cancha en este gran abrevadero para caballos. Él arrastraba sin ayuda esa cosa a la cancha”, dijo Patrick Ngwolo, abogado y pastor de Resurrection Houston, quien describió a Floyd como una figura paterna para los jóvenes de la comunidad.
Floyd terminó por integrarse a un programa cristiano que tenía tiempo llevando a hombres del tercer distrito a Minnesota, donde se les ofrecían servicios de rehabilitación para adicción a las drogas y de reinserción laboral.
“Cuando dices que te vas a Minnesota, todos saben que vas a este programa de trabajo de la iglesia de Minnesota”, señaló Ngwolo, “y que estás saliendo de este ambiente”.
Ese cambio sería un nuevo comienzo para Floyd, comentó Ngwolo, su historia de salvación.
Protector de los demás
En Minnesota, Floyd vivía en una casa dúplex de madera con dos compañeros en la orilla oriental de St. Louis Park, un suburbio en proceso de gentrificación de Mineápolis.
En 2017, comenzó a trabajar como guardia de seguridad en el Harbor Light Center del Ejército de Salvación, un refugio y alojamiento provisional para personas sin hogar del centro de la ciudad. El personal conocía a Floyd como alguien de temperamento estable que por instinto de protección acompañaba a los empleados hasta sus automóviles.
“Hay que ser una persona especial para trabajar en el ambiente del albergue”, dijo Brian Molohon, director ejecutivo de desarrollo en la división norte del Ejército de Salvación. “Todos los días te bombardean con angustias y quebrantos”.
Pese a que Floyd se adaptó a su puesto, buscó otros empleos. Cuando trabajaba en el Ejército de Salvación, solicitó empleo como portero en el restaurante y discoteca Conga Latin Bistro.
Jovanni Thunstrom, el propietario, comentó que Floyd pronto se volvió parte de la familia de empleados. Llegaba temprano y se iba tarde. Y, aunque lo intentó, nunca aprendió bien a bailar salsa.
“De inmediato me gustó su actitud”, afirmó Thunstrom, quien también era el casero de Floyd. “Te estrechaba la mano con ambas manos. Se inclinaba para saludarte”.
Floyd siempre tenía una Biblia junto a su cama. A menudo la leía en voz alta y, a pesar de su estatura, con frecuencia se acomodaba en el pasillo para rezar con Theresa Scott, una de sus compañeras de casa.
“Tenía una forma de hablar realmente genial. Su voz me recordaba a la de Ray Charles. Hablaba rápido y hablaba muy suavemente”, dijo Alvin Manago, de 55 años, quien conoció a Floyd en un juego de sóftbol en 2016. Se cayeron bien de inmediato y se convirtieron en compañeros de piso. “Tenía este tono de bajo grave. Tenías que acostumbrarte a su acento para entenderlo”.
Floyd pasó las últimas semanas de su vida recuperándose del coronavirus, el cual supo que tenía a principios de abril. Cuando ya estuvo mejor, comenzó a pasar más tiempo con su novia, y no había visto a sus compañeros de casa en algunas semanas, señaló Manago.
Al igual que millones de personas, sus compañeros de casa en la ciudad que sería su nuevo comienzo miraron el video que captó los últimos resuellos de Floyd.
Lo oyeron llamar a su difunta madre: “¡Mamá! ¡Mamá!”.
Desde la mañana del martes 9 de junio, 15 días después de ese grito de angustia, George Floyd yace y descansa junto a ella.

More than 300 theater artists — black, indigenous and people of color — on Monday published a blistering statement addressed to “White American Theater” decrying racial injustice in their industry.
“You are all a part of this house of cards built on white fragility and supremacy,” said the statement, which was published on the web. “And this is a house that will not stand.”
The signatories include Pulitzer Prize winners Lynn Nottage, Suzan-Lori Parks, Quiara Alegría Hudes and Lin-Manuel Miranda; film and television stars Viola Davis and Blair Underwood; and many Tony Award winners, including actor and director Ruben Santiago-Hudson and playwright David Henry Hwang, who is the chair of the American Theater Wing.
The statement is the artists’ response to the unrest that has roiled the United States since George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
In the weeks that followed, as discussion of race relations has intensified, numerous black theater artists have taken to social media to describe experiences of racism.
Two playwrights have begun surveying theatermakers of color about their experiences.
The Broadway Advocacy Coalition, an organization pressing for social change, this week is holding a three-part forum “for the Broadway community to heal, listen, and hold itself accountable to its history of white supremacy.”
In Britain, a group of theater artists has put together its own letter, calling for greater disclosure about diversity statistics by theaters there.
There is even a petition circulating to make the Apollo Theater, the historic Harlem venue, a Broadway house.
The statement addressing “White American Theater,” outlining the ways in which, it argues, artists of color are unjustly treated in the theater world, declares itself to be “in the legacy of August Wilson’s ‘The Ground on Which I Stand’,” an important 1996 speech by the playwright about race and the American stage.
Headlined “We See You, White American Theater,” the statement repeatedly uses the phrase “we see you” to punctuate its observations about the theater world, and adds, “We have always seen you. And now you will see us.”
It expresses concerns about programming (“We have watched you program play after play, written, directed, cast, choreographed, designed, acted, dramaturged and produced by your rosters of white theatermakers for white audiences”); labor unions (“we have watched you turn a blind eye as unions refuse to confront their racism and integrate their ranks”); media (“a monolithic and racist critical culture”); and nonprofit organizations (“asking us to politely shuffle at your galas, talkbacks, panels, board meetings, and donor dinners, in rooms full of white faces, without being willing to defend the sanctity of our bodies beyond the stages you make us jump through hoops to be considered for”).
The statement comes at a time when most American theaters, including all of those on Broadway, are closed indefinitely because of the coronavirus pandemic and most theater artists are unemployed. As unrest in the country over race relations has intensified, many theaters, as well as many commercial theater productions, have issued statements decrying racism and pledging to support systemic change; some have also opened their doors to protesters.
It was not immediately clear who organized the statement, or what the collective’s next steps will be. Several signatories referred news media questions to an email address; an inquiry to that address was not answered. The statement was posted as a petition on change.org, where tens of thousands of people signed.

When Safa Abdulkadir, a first-year medical student at the University of Minnesota, attended a protest in Minneapolis in response to the killing of George Floyd, she had no intention of putting her medical knowledge to use. It was May 26, one day after Floyd was killed, and although Abdulkadir was attending the demonstration as a protester, she made a point of wearing her white lab coat, a common symbol of medical professionals and students.
“I went more as a sign that there is someone in the medical community who is here supporting the cause,” Abdulkadir said. “I wanted my people to feel as though I was there and supporting them, and feel my presence.”
Before long, however, she saw a young woman on the ground crying, a small crowd around her. The woman told her that she had been shot in the breast with a rubber bullet. When Abdulkadir approached the group, they asked if she was a doctor, and she explained that she was a medical student. Someone asked her to look at the young woman’s wound, and bystanders formed a barrier around them so that Abdulkadir could do so. She discovered some bruising but no severe trauma; she then gave the woman a bandage she happened to have in her pocket and helped find her a cold compress.
“After that day, I decided to just continue going to the protests with the purpose of actually helping people who were hurt,” Abdulkadir said. She and some of her classmates started bringing along basic first-aid supplies, like bandages, gauze, and mixtures of milk of magnesia and water to counteract tear gas. They used red duct tape to put crosses on their white coats, and within a few days found other medical professionals who had set up volunteer triage stations to serve demonstrators.
Abdulkadir is just one of the many people in cities and towns across the country providing medical care during the George Floyd protests. These volunteers often refer to themselves as street medics, and have a history that stretches back to the civil rights movement. The term refers to a loose, informal group of people with varying degrees of medical experience, from physicians to amateurs, who attend protests and demonstrations specifically to provide medical care that participants may need.
Coalitions of street medics have formed, and many offer 20 hours of training to introduce participants to basic first-aid skills specifically tailored to protests, such as treating people with dehydration or tear gas exposure. Some organizations, like the Do No Harm Coalition, also offer bridge training to introduce medical professionals to the world of street medicine.
Ahmed Owda, a fourth-year medical student at Columbia University, watched one of the coalition’s webinars as he was preparing to attend protests as a street medic in New York.
“I’m an African American male, and that was one of the things that inspired me to come into medicine, the disparities that we witness in communities of color,” he said. As he saw documented instances of police violence against protesters nationwide, Owda said that although he was not yet a doctor, he felt it was important to use his position in, and knowledge of, health care to help protesters in ways that he could. He has been attending protests in New York in his scrubs, with bottles of water and a first-aid kit, but has not yet had to provide direct care.
Duck Bardus, a street medic in Columbus, Ohio, first completed street-medic training at the protests at the Standing Rock Reservation in 2016. Since then, Bardus has worked hundreds of protests — but this was the first time they had experienced violence directed at them while clearly marked as a street medic.
“This is the first time I have ever, ever seen anything like what we’re seeing on the streets in Columbus,” they said. “I have never been shot at with projectiles, I have never been Maced at a protest, and all of those things have happened over the last week here in Columbus.”
Bardus estimated that over the past two weeks they have treated 150 to 200 people, most frequently for chemical irritants, and called for an ambulance several times, although emergency medical technicians were not always able to reach injured people through the crowds, highlighting the important role of street medics.
On May 28, Bardus said that they were with a group of peaceful protesters when police started to “bombard them with Mace and pepper spray.”
“I treated the same guy three times in 15 minutes,” Bardus said. “I’ve never in my life seen a protester take chemical irritants like that and just pop back up and go right back. They were very, very resilient. They were determined.”
Darien Belemu, a graduate student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said that the possibility that an emergency responder might not be able to reach a protester in time was one of his main motivations for working as a street medic at protests in New York. Belemu has his EMT-B certification, and took a bridge street-medic training course, designed for people who had medical experience, from a coalition in New York.
“I see a lot of 20-year-old, 19-year-old kids that are acting, I think, really heroically and standing up to the police and making sure they know they’re not OK with police brutality,” Belemu said. “It scares me to think that somebody is not going to get treatment, especially if they have a head wound and it’s going to affect their ability to live a normal, healthy life.”
Belemu said he treated a protester on May 30 whom police had pepper-sprayed directly in the face. When the protester turned to run away, Belemu said, an officer hit the protester at the base of the skull with a baton. By the time Belemu reached him, the protester was bleeding profusely.
“That’s where your brain stem is, and any swelling there could threaten a person’s ability to breathe, or it could stop their heart,” Belemu said. “That was a very scary situation.” Belemu and a nearby medical worker cared for the protester and urged him to go to the hospital immediately if he vomited or developed a throbbing headache.
For many street medics, the coronavirus has only made their work feel more urgent. Police officers have been using tear gas on protesters, which often causes people to cough, potentially adding to the spread of the virus. Some health officials have voiced their concerns, and most street medics have been carrying masks with them to hand out to protesters, as well as trying to change gloves in between treating individuals.
“It makes me really concerned that National Guardsmen and police are using things like tear gas and pepper spray in light of the fact that we’re in a pandemic, and that those exposures could increase the risk of getting COVID-19,” said Dominique Earland, a first-year medical and doctoral student at the University of Minnesota, who has been working as a street medic in Minneapolis. “It’s especially concerning to me, as a black woman, to know that the black community was disproportionately impacted by COVID before, and then they didn’t really have any equitable responses.”
Owda shares Earland’s concerns. “Obviously COVID is an incredible disaster,” he said. “But in so many ways in my day-to-day life police violence is a bigger threat to me than COVID.”
There have been documented instances of the police destroying street-medic supplies, and Abdulkadir and Earland said that on May 30, they had to flee a triage tent where they were helping protesters, because police officers started firing rubber bullets near them.
“I cannot confirm that,” said John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department. “I have no knowledge of it.”
Earland said: “I guess I was naïve, even after most of my adult life seeing police be very brutal to people in the black community. I guess I thought that my white coat maybe could protect me.”

Artist Shaun Leonardo has accused the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland of censorship after it canceled an exhibition of his charcoal drawings of police killings of black and Latino boys and men.
The show, “The Breath of Empty Space,” which includes images of Eric Garner, Walter Scott and Freddie Gray, was to open last week. As a metaphor for erasure, the victims are sometimes hazy, a blur, or a void: Rodney King appears as a white blank surrounded by officers. Garner is shown in a chokehold. Another drawing depicts the Cleveland park where a 12-year-old boy, Tamir Rice, was killed.
The museum canceled the exhibition, organized by independent curator John Chaich, in March after local black activists and some of the museum’s staff members objected to it. The museum shared a statement with the artist that said that “troubling community response” made the institution realize that “we were not prepared to engage with the lived experiences of pain and trauma that the work evokes.”
The museum’s director, Jill Snyder, described the complaints she was hearing — namely, that “this work stirs the trauma back up for the very community that it is intending to reach and also that there is a way in which institutions like MoCA put that pain and trauma on display disrespectfully and somewhat gratuitously — that there is a performative aspect to our presentation of it.”
In an email to his followers Saturday revealing the cancellation, Leonardo, 40, who has shown his work at institutions throughout the United States and has created community-based arts programs in New York, responded.
“I must make it clear that I was never given the opportunity to be included in outreach, and therefore, never had a moment to engage any community member regarding the show,” wrote Leonardo, who identifies as Afro-Latino.
“What has become evident to me,” he said, “is that after grave mishandling of communication regarding the exhibition, institutional white fragility led to an act of censorship.”
On Sunday, Snyder posted a lengthy public apology to Leonardo on the museum’s website, which reads, in part: “I would like to acknowledge our failure in working through the challenges this exhibition presented together with Mr. Leonardo. In doing so, we failed the artist, we breached his trust, and we failed ourselves.” It concludes, “The work of anti-racism involves taking responsibility and supporting risk. We did not do this. We failed. We are learning now.”
Snyder, who said the museum had undertaken diversity initiatives in the past, added that she wished that she had invited the artist into the conversation and engaged a broader African American constituency. In subsequent conversations “with civic leaders and other members of the community,” she said, she heard “with difficulty and tough love, that the black community is not monolithic, that we should have sought other voices.”
Earlier this year, “The Breath of Empty Space” was exhibited without incident at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore — a community scarred by the death of Gray, 25, in police custody in 2015. Leonardo’s works also include “The Eulogy,” in which he delivers remarks about Trayvon Martin and other black men and boys who have been killed, backed by a band playing a New Orleans funeral march. It was performed in 2017 on the High Line in New York.
The Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland did not share the names of the critics, but in an interview, Leonardo said that he had “become aware that those views against my work are not representative of a larger black community’s perspective.”
“What I take the most offense to,” he said, is that the museum leadership “was using my work to create the opening for the dialogue that should have been happening in the first place.”
Leonardo said the reason he was speaking out now, months after the show was canceled, “was in reflection of what I saw as empty messaging coming out of primarily white art institutions since the death of George Floyd.” For example, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles apologized for a May 31 Instagram post calling for “equity and fairness” that did not mention Black Lives Matter or Floyd by name.
Since the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, Leonardo, a Queens, New York-born artist, has focused on social justice art, dealing with issues like the numbers of black and Latino men in prison, racial inequality and the use of force by police. “I Can’t Breathe” is a self-defense workshop in which participants learn how to escape the chokehold that killed Garner, as Leonardo tells them that police will interpret self-defense as resisting arrest. In “Primitive Games,” enacted at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2018, he staged a nonverbal performance that brought together four groups with conflicting views on the debate over guns in America.
In the last three years, museums have become flashpoints for debates about racial justice after displaying artworks by white artists that address subjects like violence against African Americans. Protests erupted over a painting based on a photograph of Emmett Till (at the Whitney Biennial in 2017) and a sculpture evoking the hanging of Dakota Indians (at the Walker Art Center the same year).
Since then, museums have sought to rebuild goodwill with people in the communities who feel their most painful stories are not for white artists, and museums whose leadership is overwhelmingly white, to tell. The conflict over the Cleveland exhibition reveals that even if the work is by an artist of color, an institution needs to do the proper outreach first to lay the groundwork for a sensitive show.

‘Morally Impossible’: Some Advertisers Take a Timeout From Facebook [With graphic(s)]

Nima Gardideh, the co-founder of a digital advertising agency, has encouraged his clients to hold back millions in advertising dollars from Facebook.
It struck him as “borderline tone-deaf” to run ads on social media platforms when they were being used to organize protests against racism and police brutality, he said. And the money spent on ads might have been wasted because the usual concerns of consumers seemed not to amount to much at a historic moment.
But there was something else weighing on his mind: Facebook’s hands-off attitude toward President Donald Trump’s aggressive, misleading posts.
“We harshly disagree with how Facebook has approached this,” said Gardideh, co-founder of Pearmill, a New York marketing agency with a dozen clients, mostly tech startups. “For the past couple of years, this problem has become bigger and bigger. These massive platforms have to care about free speech issues to some extent, but Facebook is on the extreme end of not caring.”
Unlike Twitter and Snap, which have toughened their stances against Trump’s online statements that contain misinformation or promote violence, Facebook has held firm on its decision to leave his posts alone. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has defended the policy, despite the resignations of some staff members and public criticism from current and former employees.
In recent days, many companies have cautiously returned to advertising, after having pulled back during the height of the pandemic in the United States. But some have decided not to advertise on Facebook, now that it has become clear that Zuckerberg will give the president a wide berth.
“I think this is Facebook’s time of reckoning,” said Dave Morgan, chief executive of Simulmedia, a company that works with advertisers on targeted television advertising. “It may not be immediate or dramatic, but advertisers have given Facebook a lot of passes, and now we are hearing they are saying it will be harder to stand back.”
In late May, the social media companies’ dealings with the president diverged. Twitter started fact-checking Trump and posted an addendum to a tweet that called for military action against participants in a protest whom Trump had described as “THUGS.”
“This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence,” the company said in a note attached to Trump’s statement.
Facebook reacted differently, allowing the same statement to go unflagged.
Around the same time, companies were struggling with how and whether to address the worldwide demonstrations prompted by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died last month in Minneapolis after a white police officer pinned him to the ground. On June 2, in an effort that became known as Blackout Tuesday, many advertisers posted images of black boxes instead of paid ads, a gesture intended to show support for the protests.
“They began to realize that all of their messaging was off-target,” said Rishad Tobaccowala, a former advertising executive who is now an author and marketing adviser.
Facebook generates 98% of its revenue through ads. It netted $17.4 billion from advertising in its most recent quarter. The pandemic has hurt advertising sales in general, and some companies are still “incredibly challenged,” said Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president for global marketing solutions. Blackout Tuesday “really had a very significant role on our platforms,” Everson added, with hundreds of companies pausing their spending.
Since then, ad revenue has mostly recovered for the company, she said, although several companies have been slow to return as they adjusted their messaging. Nike, Anheuser-Busch and others each slashed their daily Facebook and Instagram spending by more than $100,000 in early June, according to advertising analytics platform Pathmatics.
Some smaller advertisers — including authors, therapy providers and payment companies — described their break from Facebook as a protest against the platform and its subsidiaries.
Simris, an algae-growing business in Sweden, wrote in a LinkedIn post that it was “vitally dependent on digital marketing” but unwilling to “continue to enable a sick system with our funds.”
“The current developments have now rendered it morally impossible for us to continue feeding the same hand that complacently offers its services as the major platform for hate-mongering, promotion of violence, and disinformation,” the company wrote.
Last week, Braze, a software company in New York, withdrew a Facebook ad campaign it had planned later this summer valued at around $60,000. Its chief marketing officer, Sara Spivey, said Facebook’s decision to leave presidential statements untouched factored into the decision.
“Facebook is the biggest publishing platform arguably in the world, so of course we want to be on it,” Spivey said. “But the bigger question is Facebook’s responsibility to make its platform safe and if we want to be associated with it.”
Abe Kasbo, head of marketing agency Verasoni Worldwide in Fairfield, New Jersey, said his agency ceased all Facebook ads soon after Zuckerberg’s comments defending Trump’s posts. Verasoni, a small agency representing regional banks and retailers, said it stopped its $6,000 monthly budget on Facebook ads.
“The amplification of divisive speech and the lack of responsibility that Facebook is taking as a platform forced this,” Kasbo said.
Everson, the Facebook executive who deals with marketers, said she had never worked more closely with Zuckerberg than she has in the past week. She acknowledged that the company’s decision on Trump’s social-media statements “is not a decision that everyone agrees is a perfect decision.”
On Friday night, she sent a personal note to top advertisers, attached to a long public post from Zuckerberg that promised to review some of Facebook’s policies. She said that most of her discussions with clients now focused on efforts to dismantle systemic racial inequality within companies.
“Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the conversation has moved off the decision about the Trump post,” she said. “It actually would minimize the importance of this moment historically to just focus on one post from President Trump.”
The Trump campaign spent more than $2.8 million advertising on the platform last month, according to Advertising Analytics, a media tracking firm. Combined with spending by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint effort with the Republican National Committee, the president’s reelection team was the 10th largest advertiser on Facebook behind Samsung, Microsoft and The Walt Disney Co., according to Pathmatics.
Most of Facebook’s 8 million advertisers are small businesses or individuals, who “continue to depend and rely on our platforms,” Everson said. Many of them are uncomfortable with the negativity on the platform but feel they have no choice but to keep promoting themselves on it.
Gardideh, of Pearmill, said his clients had tripled their advertising spending in the past four months, as the pandemic pushed down the cost for ad space. In the past few days, some of them shifted some of their Facebook budgets to Google and LinkedIn, he said, or paused social media marketing entirely.
He conceded that his clients were likely to return to Facebook soon because the platform “is just the best option there is right now, in terms of cost and scale,” he said.
Lutchi Gayot, a small-business owner and congressional candidate in New York, said he paid for Facebook ads while feeling conflicted about it.
“The moral thing to do, of course, is to stand on the side that’s right,” he said. “But it’s hard — Facebook ads are keeping small businesses alive. If you’re not on Facebook, you don’t exist.”

One year ago Tuesday, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Hong Kong gathered for a march that became the start of the semiautonomous Chinese city’s biggest political crisis and the broadest expression of public anger with Beijing in decades.
In the months that followed, protesters filled the city’s streets, broke into the local legislature and vandalized it, staged sit-ins at the airport, and turned a university campus into a fiery battleground. Earlier this year, the demonstrations quieted amid the coronavirus pandemic.
But Beijing’s push to impose national security laws over the territory has prompted some protesters to return to the streets. Their presence is a reminder that many thorny issues — including the demonstrators’ demands for greater official accountability — remain unresolved.
Here is a look at how we got here.
Crowding the Streets
Organizers estimate that 1 million people marched June 9, 2019, against a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China. The rally was mostly peaceful, though some protesters and police officers clashed after midnight. Three days later, police fired tear gas at protesters who had blocked a major highway outside the local legislature. The heavy-handed response prompted another June march that organizers said drew nearly 2 million people.
Crashing the Legislature
On July 1, hundreds of thousands of people marched to denounce police brutality and Beijing’s growing influence over the city on the 22nd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to China. A group of demonstrators also smashed their way into the local legislature using metal bars and makeshift battering rams. That confrontation reflected a wider attempt by the protest movement to target symbols of authority, including local police stations and the Chinese government’s liaison office in the city.
Clashing With Police
Street clashes between black-clad protesters and police became routine. Increasingly, protesters coordinated their actions on the fly using encrypted messaging — an effort to evade police and new restrictions on public gatherings. Some began carrying makeshift weapons, attacking opponents on the streets and vandalizing businesses seen as supporting police and the government. A slogan from the movie series “The Hunger Games” — “If we burn, you burn with us” — became a call to arms.
Getting Attacked by a Mob
On July 21, after protesters vandalized Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong, a mob attacked a group of protesters in a train station. Dozens were injured, including journalists and a pro-democracy legislator. The appearance of police inaction that night would fuel widespread anger toward the Hong Kong police force and suspicion that officers were unwilling to protect anti-government protesters.
Shutting Down the Airport
By August, Hong Kong’s sleek and efficient airport was the center of protesters’ focus. First there were days of sit-ins by demonstrators who wanted to voice their complaints to some of the tens of thousands of travelers who move through the airport each day. The protesters then blocked some travelers, snarling flights and causing hundreds of cancellations. After protesters attacked two men from mainland China, the airport obtained a court injunction barring access to its terminals to anyone expect employees and travelers bearing flight tickets.
Firing at Protesters
While Beijing marked the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1 with a military parade, protesters in Hong Kong held widespread demonstrations that turned violent. An officer fired a live round that hit an 18-year-old who, according to video, appeared to hit the officer with a pipe. The teenager was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment. Days later, the Hong Kong government used emergency powers to ban face masks at protests, a move that was scaled back in a series of court rulings.
Taking Universities by Storm
In some of the most dramatic moments of the protest movement, university campuses became focal points of unrest in November after a student demonstrator died in a fall from a parking garage during a police operation. Protesters occupied the Chinese University of Hong Kong for five days. Activists in and around the Hong Kong Polytechnic University fought off police by hurling Molotov cocktails and launching arrows from bows. Police later arrested hundreds of protesters after a lengthy siege.
Winning an Election
The protest movement earned a stunning victory in late November as pro-democracy candidates captured most of the seats in local elections for district councils, one of the lowest elected offices in the city. It was a vivid expression of the city’s aspirations and its anger with the Chinese government, and the protests subsided for several weeks after that. On New Year’s Day, demonstrators returned to the streets in full force in a protest that started peacefully but descended into violent clashes with police.
Pausing for a Pandemic
Early this year, after the coronavirus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread around the world, the protests eased as residents stayed home and social distancing rules were imposed. But demonstrators pressured the government in other ways, notably through a union of hospital employees that went on strike to force the government to slow travel from mainland China to lessen the risk of spreading the coronavirus.
Facing New Scrutiny
Lunchtime rallies reemerged this spring, though on a much smaller scale than the protests by office workers and others that brought traffic to a halt in key business districts last year. Last month, protesters took to the streets to vent their anger over Beijing’s plan to impose new national security laws and a bill in front of the local legislature that would ban the disrespect of China’s national anthem. Police, who have taken a more aggressive approach to clamping down on protests after a new commissioner was installed last year, arrested at least 180 people.
Defying a Ban
Hong Kong has long hosted the only large-scale remembrance on Chinese soil of the Chinese military’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 4, 1989. Last year, in a reflection of the growing concern in the city over the proposed extradition law, organizers said more than 180,000 people attended the vigil. This year, police banned the event for the first time in 30 years, citing the epidemic risk, but thousands of people defied authorities and gathered in districts across the city.
One Year of Protests
On Tuesday evening, a few thousand people, some still in their office clothes, marched through downtown Hong Kong, holding up the lights of their cellphones and chanting protest slogans like, “Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!”

Roderick Sewell knows about making adjustments.
He was born without tibias, but his life changed when he got his first pair of prosthetic legs at 8 years old. As a child who loved sports, he played wheelchair basketball and ran track but found true love and major success in the pool.
Sewell made the U.S. national team in the 100-meter breaststroke for his classification at the 2017 world championships, competing against athletes with amputations or very limited use of some of their limbs.
Then, last year, a friend who saw Sewell’s prowess during the swimming and running portions of a relay triathlon suggested he try doing all three parts of the race, even though he had never operated a handcycle. Six months later, Sewell completed the mother of all Ironman courses — at the Ironman world championships in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii — in 16 hours 26 minutes. He was the first above-the-knee, double amputee to finish the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run.
The experience prompted a series of tantalizing thoughts: Given the increasing competitiveness of Paralympic swimming, might he have a better chance of making the U.S. team in cycling rather than in swimming? Could he win a medal in either sport? Better yet, might he be skilled enough to make both teams?
When the coronavirus pandemic caused the International Olympic Committee to postpone the 2020 Tokyo Games for a year, thousands of athletes who had been training for years had their lives disrupted. For Sewell, pushing back the games had a significant benefit: He now had an extra year to prepare for a two-sport attempt at the Paralympics, something only a few athletes do each quadrennial. And he was fairly certain that training for each event, both of which rely on his core and upper body strength, would improve his chances.
“I don’t just want a ticket to Tokyo,” Sewell, 28, said in a recent interview. “Now I have another year to get myself onto the podium.”
Sewell won’t really know whether his plan is working until competitions return later in the year. The journey has been a little complicated lately.
Sewell left his home in Brooklyn, New York, on March 3 to move to Colorado for high-altitude training. He rented an apartment on Airbnb near the Olympic and Paralympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. The first week, all was well. He’d wake up in the morning, eat and go train. Then the training center closed on March 18 and Colorado effectively shut down once stay-at-home orders went into effect on March 26.
He remained in Colorado through the end of March, but with infection rates rising in both Colorado Springs and, especially, at home in Brooklyn, Sewell went to Milwaukee to live with a friend for most of April. Then he headed to his aunt’s house in Homestead, Florida. He assumed that with beaches scheduled to reopen in early May he could swim 2 miles in the open water each day. But the beaches near his aunt’s house remained largely closed for swimming longer than he had anticipated. Unfamiliar with the roads, he didn’t feel all that comfortable training hard with his handcycle.
So Sewell has been running as many as 7 miles a day to maintain a base level of fitness and has kept his diet in check. Carbs in the morning, a waffle, maybe, and fruit. Meat — chicken, lamb, goat, bison — and other proteins during the daytime. Then vegetables at night. Asparagus, broccoli, spinach, especially anything dark green because of the nutrients.
As New York began to reopen, Sewell started planning to move home. Then George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, protests and civil unrest erupted across the country, and training receded a little further back in his mind.
“2020 has been an interesting year,” he said last week from Florida. “It’s definitely not going the way we thought it would be.”
Life rarely has for Sewell, who began swimming lessons when he was 10 because his mother feared that he would drown if he fell into the small pool at their apartment complex in San Diego.
Alan Voisard, who taught Sewell his first swim strokes and still coaches him, said Sewell struggled at first. But as Sewell grew — he now stands at 6-foot-1 on his prostheses — swimming became easier, and Voisard encouraged him to begin competing.
He will need to cut a few more seconds off his time in the 100-meter breaststroke to qualify for next year’s Paralympics. He finished in 1:35.58 at the World Para Swimming Championships in 2017. Training purists would likely say that improving on that time will require more time in the pool, but Sewell believes working on his cycling will actually help. Voisard said Sewell had already hit his swim goal in training but, in competition, he has a tendency to get excited and churn his arms, rather than feel the water and fall into an optimal rhythm for elite swimmers.
“His tempo gets off, and he ends up sort of spinning his wheels,” Voisard said.
Yet that tendency to churn, hard, with an intensity that can match his fitness and strength, made Sewell an immediate success on a hand-powered cycle.
Sewell had never planned to try cycling, but in April 2019 he completed the swimming and running legs of a relay triathlon. He ran a 1:39 half-marathon. That got Bob Babbitt thinking.
Babbitt is a founder of the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which provides opportunities and prosthetics for disabled athletes and was instrumental in getting Sewell’s first set of prosthetic legs. He is also a triathlon veteran, having first competed in 1980, when the triathlon was perceived as little more than a goofy endeavor. Babbitt later co-founded Competitor Magazine, formerly a mainstay of the endurance world.
“I thought, if Roderick could learn how to use a handcycle he could be a heck of a triathlete,” Babbitt said. “He never looked like he was pushing hard.”
Babbitt got Sewell a handcycle, and Sewell proved him right in Hawaii in October.
“I had never biked more than 100 miles,” Sewell said. “I had never run more than a half-marathon. There were a lot of firsts that day.”
There is no triathlon event in the Paralympics for double above-the-knee amputees. But the kneeling handcycle, a less common pursuit than swimming, may be Sewell’s best chance for success, especially with chances to medal in two handcycling road races at the games.
Now Sewell just needs pools to reopen and to get to New York, where he feels comfortable cycling in Brooklyn, Central Park or over the George Washington Bridge to the New Jersey Palisades. He plans to return this month.
After several years of teaching swimming, Sewell wants to begin training to work as a personal financial adviser, in addition to honing his skills on the handcycle. The coming racing schedule, which has yet to be announced, will help him set his time goals and training regimen — one more series of adjustments in a life filled with them.
“I can see what needs to change and what I need to fix,” he said. “It’s all about becoming one with the bike.”

Child Abuse Cases Drop 51%. The Authorities Are Very Worried. [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Reports of child abuse in New York City have dropped sharply since the coronavirus crisis began.
And that is worrying the authorities.
The steep decline could be a sign that an unseen epidemic of abuse is spreading behind locked doors, according to police, prosecutors and child protection officials. As the virus has shuttered the city, the fragile system of safeguards designed to protect children has fallen apart.
Teachers are normally the leading reporters of suspected abuse, calling for help when they notice bruises or signs of hunger or mistreatment at home. Now, teachers get a glimpse of their students only in a virtual classroom, if they see them at all.
And while much of the city has been staying indoors and “staying safe,” for many children from troubled homes, the coronavirus pandemic has confined them to the most dangerous place they can be.
In the first eight weeks of spring 2019, New York City’s child welfare agency received an average of 1,374 cases of abuse or neglect to investigate each week. In the same period this year, that number fell to 672, a decline of 51%.
The citywide shutdowns of schools and, until Monday, nonessential businesses have upended every aspect of the child welfare system. Besides the worrisome decline in the reporting of abuse and neglect, the pandemic has forced investigators to change how they do their jobs. They’ve also had to postpone reunions of children with parents who were successfully undergoing counseling or were cleared of wrongdoing.
“You would think that when we see a decrease in the number of incidents and reports, that would be a good thing: ‘Oh my God, that means kids are safer,’” said Darcel Clark, the Bronx district attorney. “But it’s just the opposite.”
“Those people who would ordinarily see our children,” she said, “their teachers, the pediatricians, social workers, camp counselors, etc., since they don’t have eyes on them now, we don’t know what’s happening with them.”
The tensions resulting from stay-at-home orders and social distancing — isolation, unemployment and even alcohol abuse — can easily erupt into violence, child welfare experts said. Sexual predators now have all-day access to children who would normally be in school; in the Bronx, for example, sexual abuse is the most common type of child abuse arrest since the start of the pandemic, according to the borough’s District Attorney’s Office.
Typically, most reports coming into the Administration for Children’s Services, the city’s child welfare agency, are unsubstantiated. Recently, however, some confirmed reports depict nightmarish scenarios in which children are virtually trapped by abusive or neglectful adults.
In one case, a foster mother was arrested after someone noticed marks on the wrist of an 8-year-old boy in her care.
The mother had strapped the boy to his bed, spreading each of his limbs and tightening them with zip ties until his wrists and ankles were bruised.
According to a criminal complaint that redacted the name of the person who reported the abuse, the foster mother, Lourdes Gonzalez, said that she tied the boy down because he kept leaving her apartment to ride his scooter. “This is the only way I can control him,” she said.
Reached by phone, Gonzalez, 53, said she wanted to consult her attorney before commenting.
In one home, two neglected children had been caring for themselves, including doing all the grocery shopping. They were finally discovered when their mother started a fire after falling asleep while using heroin.
The authorities removed an 11-year-old and a 4-year-old from another home after they grew frightened of their mother, who awoke each day from a drunken stupor and accused them of stealing food from the kitchen.
The number of cases citywide being referred to ACS rose from a low of 472 in the last week of March, when many low-income students were not attending virtual classes because the city had not yet given them iPads, to 823 in the third week of May. That was still far below the normal weekly rate.
Clark, the district attorney, said she could not speculate as to whether cases would be discovered sooner if children were physically in school. She noted that one teacher called the authorities after she saw a parent hit a child on camera during a virtual class.
The pandemic also has presented new difficulties for ACS, which has been heavily scrutinized in the past for missing signs of abuse or neglect that then led to the deaths of children.
The agency has had to adjust the way it handles complaints and checks on troubled families. For example, investigators now talk to parents and children outside their homes, not inside, so as to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. To get a look inside, to make sure there is food in refrigerators, investigators ask parents to give a tour with their phones, said David A. Hansell, the commissioner of ACS.
In many cases, investigators have responded to reports of neglect and found that they were related to families’ struggles with COVID-19. With the virus in mind, one investigator decided against removing children from a home where the food had run out. Instead, the investigator went to a pantry and took food to the family, according to the agency. In other instances, investigators have been helping families secure computer tablets for their children to attend online school after they were reported as truant because they had not been logging on during class.
In one particularly heartbreaking case, investigators found a teenager living alone and caring for a dog and three cats after his mother died of the virus. Investigators placed him in a foster intake center until they found his godmother, who took in the teenager and the pets a couple days later.
Though ACS has had scandals in the past surrounding the deaths of children, it also has been criticized for what parent advocates have called unnecessary investigations of families, particularly for poverty-related neglect, and the resulting removals of children from predominantly black and Hispanic homes.
Since a spike in the number of children placed in foster care in the 1980s, the agency has steadily reduced such placements, focusing more on keeping children with their families while supervised. It took decades to drive the number down from a peak of about 50,000 to the current 7,700.
But reuniting children with parents or placing them with adoptive families has virtually come to a halt during the pandemic.
Parents hoping for a resolution of custody cases can’t get a court hearing — family court has shrunk from 162 courtrooms to 11 virtual ones, and judges are prioritizing cases in which a child is deemed to be in immediate danger.
During the first full week of May last year, there were about 11,300 in-court appearances. During a similar time period this year, there were just 464, according to data from city courts.
And biological parents accustomed to weekly visits with their children in foster homes are now essentially cut off because many foster parents do not want their homes exposed to people who have taken public transportation.
One teenager, Liam, 14, a chronic runaway now staying at the Children’s Village, a youth home in Dobbs Ferry, New York, said he had been expecting to go home in March. He was on Facebook when he saw the news that the city was about to start shutting down nonessential activities. Fifteen minutes later, he said, the Children’s Village staff “told me I wasn’t going to be able to go home.”
Liam said he was missing weekend visits with his family; he sees them only through video chats now.
Visitation is key in placing children in permanent homes, whether back with their biological parents, with other relatives or with adoptive families, said Georgia Booth, senior vice president of child welfare for the Children’s Aid Society.
During these visits, adults and children receive therapy that involves play. “Visits provide the chance to help parents and teens work through techniques to de-escalate serious arguments,” said Jeremy Kohomban, executive director of the Children’s Village. And social workers can observe how parents and children are getting along to confirm that they are ready to reunite, he said.
Hansell, the ACS commissioner, said the agency was encouraging foster care agencies “to think creatively about visits outdoors, in parks, in public settings, with the least amount of transportation for parents and children.”
One mother, Jane, who did not want to use her full name to protect her privacy, was expecting in March to regain custody of her 2-year-old daughter, Anna. Jane’s daughter was taken from her at birth.
Years of drug dependency had contributed to her losing rights to her five older children as well. Now 41, Jane broke an addiction to crystal methamphetamine to get herself on track to regain custody of Anna. “I did a drug program,” she said. “I did a parenting class. They had me do drug tests, random drug tests.”
She got a job at a Whole Foods in Manhattan; she recently was promoted to assistant manager. She moved out of a homeless shelter and rented a room in a house. Her attorneys at the Center for Family Representation helped Jane go before a judge, who slowly restored more and more of her parental rights to Anna. But a March 23 hearing at which she was expecting to get permission for a trial custody period was canceled because of the coronavirus.
Last week, the hearing finally took place. Afterward, for the first time in Anna’s life, she spent the night with her mother.

Bail Is $1.25 Million In Floyd Murder Case: [National Desk]

Full text: Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Mr. Floyd's death.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The white police officer charged with murder in the killing two weeks ago of George Floyd, a black man whose death in custody led to nationwide protests, was given a bail of as much as $ 1.25 million on Monday.
Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran, participated in his initial hearing at the heavily fortified Hennepin County courthouse on a video feed from jail. Mr. Chauvin, who has been behind bars since he was arrested on May 29, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and second-degree murder, a more serious count than he had originally faced. He could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison.
Mr. Chauvin, who placed his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd for nearly nine minutes in a video that prompted anguish and outrage across the nation, has been a focus of anger, referred to as the most hated man in the world. Activists said they feared he would not abide by bail restrictions if he was permitted to go home until trial.
Arguing for a bail of $ 1.25 million, the prosecutor Matthew Frank said Mr. Floyd's death had created "a strong reaction in the community, to put it mildly." He said that created two factors in deciding bail.
"One is the likelihood to flee from the jurisdiction because of not only the severity of the charges, but the strength of the community's opinion," he said. "And secondly, because of the severity of those charges, a significant amount of bail is warranted."
During the hearing, Mr. Chauvin wore an orange jumpsuit and a blue mask that muffled his responses of "Yes, your honor" to a few procedural questions. Eric Nelson, Mr. Chauvin's lawyer, said he did not object to the state's bail request at this time; Judge Jeannice M. Reding granted it.
Mr. Chauvin's bail would be $ 1 million if he agrees to certain conditions, including surrendering any of his firearms, remaining in the state until trial, not working in law enforcement and avoiding any contact with the Floyd family.
His next court appearance is scheduled for June 29, when he will enter a plea and some of the state's evidence could be laid out.
Mr. Chauvin's bail is higher than the bail of at least $ 750,000 given last week to the other three officers accused of aiding and abetting in Mr. Floyd's death. Lawyers for two of those men, both rookies who had just days on the job, blamed Mr. Chauvin, who was a training officer for both of them. The third former officer has cooperated with the authorities. Those are all indications that the police officers will not be presenting a united front, unusual in cases in which the police are charged in a death.
All four men were fired the day after Mr. Floyd died.
On that evening of May 25, an employee of a corner store in south Minneapolis called the police, reporting that a counterfeit $ 20 bill had been used to buy cigarettes. The two rookie officers, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- who between them had seven days on the job -- responded first.
Mr. Floyd, sitting in a nearby car, stiffened when the officers tried to put him in the back of their police car, and fell to the ground, according to an arrest affidavit. Mr. Floyd told the officers that he was not resisting arrest but was claustrophobic and did not want to get in the back seat of the car.
Then Mr. Chauvin and his partner, Tou Thao, arrived. Mr. Floyd struggled, and began saying he could not breathe, the affidavit says. Mr. Chauvin pulled Mr. Floyd out of the passenger side of the squad car at 8:19 p.m. Still handcuffed, Mr. Floyd went to the ground.
The rookie officers held Mr. Floyd's back and legs. As Mr. Chauvin held his left knee on Mr. Floyd's neck over almost nine minutes, Mr. Floyd said "I can't breathe" and "Mama" and then, after a time, nothing at all.
The protests started the next day in Minneapolis before spreading to the world. Although some have turned into violent clashes with the police, and arsons and looting were reported in the early days in some protests, demonstrations were largely calm in recent days.
It is a temporary peace, activists cautioned, if Mr. Chauvin is not convicted.
"There is a real significant discrepancy between what happens when a policeman does something and a black man does something," said one protester, Sara Semi, who just got "#icantbreathe" tattooed on her neck. "Chauvin needs to get life in prison if we want to see justice."
Mr. Nelson, Mr. Chauvin's lawyer, declined to comment when contacted by The New York Times.
Since the protests, Minneapolis has made changes. The University of Minnesota, the city school board and the parks department have cut ties with the police. On Sunday, a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council pledged to dismantle the city's Police Department and create a new system of public safety in a city where the police have long been accused of racism.
In addition, Mr. Chauvin's wife of almost 10 years has filed for divorce. They separated three days after Mr. Floyd's killing.
Mr. Chauvin, who is 44, did not always want to be a police officer. He studied food preparation at a technical college, taking classes like "pantry food preparation," "job seeking skills" and "stocks, sauces and soups," according to his personnel file with the Minneapolis Police Department. He worked as a cook at McDonald's and made ribs and chicken at Tinucci's Restaurant. Then he switched paths, becoming a military police officer in the U.S. Army, serving in Germany.
At the Police Department, his record was mixed. Mr. Chauvin appears to have been reprimanded -- and possibly suspended -- after a woman complained in 2007 that he needlessly removed her from her car, his personnel file showed. She told the authorities that he searched her and put her in the back of a squad car for driving 10 miles an hour over the speed limit.
Mr. Chauvin was also the subject of at least 16 other misconduct complaints over two decades. His personnel file, heavily redacted, included no details on these.
But he was also given at least two medals of valor. One was for his role in fatally shooting someone who was pointing a sawed-off shotgun at officers in 2006, the records said. The second was for a domestic-violence call in 2008. Mr. Chauvin broke down a bathroom door; after a struggle, he twice shot the person being sought, his file said.
Mr. Chauvin was awarded two medals of commendation. In 2008, he was recognized for apprehending a man accused of pointing a gun at a man and a woman -- Mr. Chauvin and his partner followed the man with a gun, eventually tackling the man, who dropped a loaded .357.
His second was for working off-duty as security in November 2008 outside El Nuevo Rodeo. After he saw a man in an altercation fire off two rounds, Mr. Chauvin arrested him, the records showed. He also arrested some of the man's friends, the records said, all of whom were accused of being part of a street gang.
That club may have been Mr. Chauvin's only earlier connection to Mr. Floyd, who had also worked security at El Nuevo Rodeo for much of the year before their fatal encounter. It was uncertain whether they knew each other.

Full text: Legislators, responding to protests over the death of George Floyd, are approving a package of bills aimed at police misconduct.
Inspired by the protests sweeping the state and nation, New York legislative leaders on Monday began to approve an expansive package of bills targeting police misconduct, defying longstanding opposition from law enforcement groups, including police unions.
The measures range from a ban on the use of chokeholds to the repeal of an obscure decades-old statute that has effectively hidden the disciplinary records of police officers from public view, making it virtually impossible for victims to know whether a particular officer has a history of abuse.
The legislation marks one of the most substantial policy changes to result from the nearly two weeks of national unrest that followed George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, including in New York City, where tens of thousands of protesters participated in mostly peaceful marches to demand more police accountability.
The proposals signify a turning-point in Albany. Many of the policy changes being voted on this week languished for years because of opposition from influential police and corrections unions that contribute generously to the campaigns of elected officials -- a tactic that had great effect in the State Senate, which has traditionally been under Republican control.
But Democrats assumed control of the full Legislature last year for the first time in nearly a decade, clearing the way for lawmakers to pass some of the law enforcement bills on Monday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said on Monday he supported the bills and intended to sign them into law.
The pressure on elected officials to enact police reforms has reverberated across the nation.
Officials in Minneapolis moved to ban chokeholds and pledged to disband its police department. In Congress, Democrats plan to unveil expansive legislation this week to combat racial bias and excessive use of force by law enforcement. On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed for the first time to cut funding for the New York Police Department.
The protests in New York, which in some cases included violent clashes between the police and demonstrators, sparked a groundswell of support that seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago, placing unavoidable pressure on state and city lawmakers who were already consumed with the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
In one such clash, a police officer was recorded on video shoving a female protester to the ground and was heard calling her a "bitch." The officer, who has been identified by elected officials as Vincent D'Andraia, is expected to be arrested on Tuesday and face prosecution by the Brooklyn district attorney's office, according to three law enforcement officials.
Officer D'Andraia, who has already been suspended without pay, is expected to face misdemeanor charges of assault, harassment and menacing over the May 29 incident, one of the officials said. The protester, Dounya Zayer, 20, has said she suffered a concussion and seizures as a result of the attack.
The pending arrest lies in stark contrast to the aftermath of Eric Garner's death on Staten Island after a police officer held him in a chokehold in 2014.
The New York City Council soon introduced a bill to criminalize chokeholds by the police; after a Staten Island grand jury refused to approve criminal charges against the officers involved in Mr. Garner's death, the measure gained momentum.
But in December 2014, as anger against the police heightened, two police officers were assassinated in an attack that many officers thought had been inspired by anti-police rhetoric after Mr. Garner's death. Mayor de Blasio, in danger of losing the support of the rank-and-file police and their unions, threatened to veto the legislation.
The bill, which has languished since, now has enough support to overcome a mayoral veto, and will come to a vote on June 18. It would make the use of chokeholds by members of the New York Police Department a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine.
Rory I. Lancman, a councilman from Queens and the primary sponsor of the city's chokehold bill, said that when he saw video of Mr. Floyd's death, he immediately recalled Mr. Garner's death, and his repeated utterances of "I can't breathe."
"There was the same feeling of helplessness and wanting to jump in the screen and push that officer off him," Mr. Lancman said.
Mr. Lancman's bill has been expanded this year because of the way in which Mr. Floyd was killed. It will prohibit any action that "restricts the flow of air or blood by compressing the windpipe, diaphragm, or the carotid arteries" in the effort to make an arrest.
The State Legislature on Monday passed its own bill banning police chokeholds; the "Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act" characterizes police chokeholds as "aggravated strangulation" and classifies that as a Class C felony.
Prosecutors would have to meet a higher threshold to charge an officer with a felony, compared to a misdemeanor, and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer's intent was to block a person's breathing in order to get a conviction. They could, theoretically, charge an officer with both a chokehold misdemeanor and felony.
But another policing bill has been even more contentious: State lawmakers received thousands of emails in recent days urging them to repeal a 1970s-era law in the state's civil code known as 50-a, which prohibits the release of "all personnel records used to evaluate performance" of police officers without permission from the officer or a judge.
Under Mayor de Blasio, the New York Police Department fought in court to expand the interpretation of the law so that it shielded the results of disciplinary hearings against individual officers.
Calls to repeal the law escalated after Mr. Garner's death at the hands of Daniel Pantaleo, a police officer whose litany of misconduct complaints was kept secret for years. Mr. Pantaleo, whose records were eventually leaked following an unsuccessful lawsuit to make them public, was fired last year after an administrative judge found him guilty of violating a department ban on chokeholds.
Legislation to repeal or modify the law, however, never gained significant traction in the State Capitol.
Assemblyman Daniel J. O'Donnell, a Democrat from Manhattan who sponsored the bill to repeal the law, said that while public defenders and activists supported it, most ordinary citizens were unaware of the bill, and momentum never coalesced.
That changed as New Yorkers learned recently of past misconduct complaints lodged against Derek Chauvin, the white police officer whose actions led to the death of Mr. Floyd, who was black. The records became public because Minnesota does not have a law barring the disclosure of such records; New York is one of the few remaining states with such a secrecy law.
"The biggest problem in our nation now is the lack of trust between policing authorities and the policed," said Mr. O'Donnell, who first introduced the bill in 2015. "This is one way that would go a long way in restoring that."
The move to repeal the law drew forceful opposition from the state's powerful police unions, which argued that the changes could lead to reputational harm if complaints of misconduct that have not been substantiated were allowed to be released.
Union officials, including those from the Police Benevolent Association, which represents 40,000 active and retired New York City police officers, said lawmakers were voting with little deliberation and in the shadow of a pandemic and civil unrest.
"Beyond any specific policy changes, the overall impact of this legislative effort is to foster a view of law enforcement officers as alien agents of hostile power, whose authority can be disregarded or actively opposed at will," a coalition of unions representing law enforcement officers wrote in a memo of opposition.
Carl Heastie, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, said that the bills were not anti-police, but that the killing of Mr. Floyd was a breaking point for many lawmakers.
"Sometimes things happen, that even in the normal course of politics and governing, where it just opens people's eyes," he said during a news conference in Albany on Monday.
Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, said law enforcement has operated under "rules they set for themselves" for far too long.
"If I've got 20 accusations of excessive force that are unsubstantiated, that's got to be a red flag, one way or the other," she said in an interview. "We can no longer afford complaint after complaint built up on your record and then nobody does anything about it. That's over."
Mr. de Blasio has said he supports reforming, not repealing the law, with certain safeguards to protect officers' privacy.
Mr. Cuomo, following years of remaining mostly noncommittal on the issue, threw his support behind repeal, acknowledging it would infuriate law enforcement unions.
Lawmakers will vote later this week on 50-a and on a bill that would require state police officers to wear body cameras.
Other law-enforcement bills passed on Monday included legislation to require courts to compile and publish racial and demographic data on low-level offenders. Another measure would enshrine in law the special prosecutor's office to investigate police killings, which was created by executive order in 2015.
Another bill entitled people to "a private right of action" if they believed someone called a police officer on them because of their race, gender, nationality or any other protected class. The bill was a direct response to incidents of black people being falsely reported to the police, including the encounter caught on video last month of a white woman falsely claiming in a 911 call that a black birder was threatening her.
"I really don't want to lose this moment," said State Senator Kevin Parker, a Democrat from Brooklyn who introduced the bill. "The rate of protests is not sustainable indefinitely, so it's important to get as much as we can during this period."

Maurice Gordon’s mother and sister were at home in London when the call came.
Gordon, a 28-year-old black man who had moved to the United States from Jamaica to work and attend college, had been shot and killed by a New Jersey State Police trooper during a traffic stop on May 23. There had been a struggle, his mother said she was told, and Gordon had been shot four times.
The shooting occurred two days before the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis after a white officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes, setting off weeks of nationwide protests by demonstrators demanding an overhaul of policing and increased accountability.
“I’m broken inside,” Gordon’s mother, Racquel Barrett, said in an interview early Monday. “I just need answers: Why did they kill my son?”
Hours later, the state’s attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, released 12 audio and video recordings, including a limited backward-facing camera view of the deadly struggle between Gordon and the trooper, Sgt. Randall Wetzel, who is white.
The attorney general’s office said that Gordon had been spotted at about 6:26 a.m. driving southbound at 110 mph on the Garden State Parkway in Bass River, about 100 miles south of New York City.
It was Gordon’s fourth encounter with the police in 30 hours after a friend in New York called 911 to express concern about Gordon’s “well-being and whereabouts,” according to the attorney general. “He looked very, very panicked,” the friend told the dispatcher, according to a recording of the 911 call. “He said something about a paranormal experience.”
Before the shooting, Gordon tried twice to sit in the driver’s seat of Wetzel’s police car, prompting the officer to initially use pepper spray on Gordon, according to the attorney general’s office.
The attorney general’s office is investigating the shooting. Gov. Philip D. Murphy said a grand jury would review Gordon’s death to consider possible criminal charges under a protocol established by Grewal in December to guide inquiries into the police’s use of deadly force.
“Any life lost is a loss to be mourned and grieved,” Murphy said at a briefing Monday. “Police have a responsibility to protect the people they serve, and that demands a high level of accountability when things go wrong.”
Wetzel, a 15-year State Police veteran, has been placed on administrative leave. A union representative did not return calls seeking comment.
Gordon moved from Jamaica to Poughkeepsie, New York, at 19, joining several half-siblings who lived in the area. He drove for Uber and made deliveries for Uber Eats while studying chemistry at Dutchess Community College’s Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program, relatives and school officials said.
He dreamed of being a chemistry teacher, his mother said.
A former girlfriend told The Pine Barrens Tribune, a South Jersey publication, that he was being treated for schizophrenia. His mother, sister and a family lawyer neither confirmed nor disputed that, but they said it was irrelevant to his death. The former girlfriend could not be immediately reached for comment.
“I don’t think his mental health has anything to do with it,” Barrett said.
The lawyer, William O. Wagstaff III, said there were more questions than answers about what had led to the struggle, which he said happened nearly 40 minutes into Gordon’s encounter with the police.
Wagstaff, who said he had been allowed to view a portion of the police footage before it was released, said that Gordon’s car was pulled off to the side of the parkway’s left-hand passing lane. When Gordon was asked to move his car to the safety of the opposite shoulder, it would not start, Wagstaff said.
At first, Gordon sat in his car while waiting for a tow truck to arrive, the lawyer said. He then moved to the back seat of the trooper’s car, which was parked behind his.
Gordon was frisked before entering the trooper’s car and was not carrying a weapon, Wagstaff said.
He was not handcuffed, and there was no indication that he was being placed under arrest. At one point, Wetzel suggested that Gordon’s car might have run out of gas and he asked Gordon whether he wanted to accompany the tow truck to the repair shop once it arrived. The sergeant told Gordon that he was being held in the police car to avoid the danger of waiting on the busy highway.
Just after 7 a.m., Gordon, who can be seen in the police footage wearing a seat belt and sitting calmly in the back of the trooper’s car for about 21 minutes, climbed out, and the two men began to struggle.
“He’s aware he has no weapons on him,” Wagstaff, referring to the trooper’s knowledge that Gordon was unarmed. “There was no ticket — no notice that he’s being arrested.”
The video of the struggle offers only a partial, distant view of the altercation. Wetzel and Gordon can be seen grappling behind the trooper’s car, separating and then sparring again just before six shots ring out. After Gordon falls to the ground, Wetzel placed him in handcuffs.
After the shooting, Wetzel can be heard on the video telling another law enforcement official that Gordon had tried to grab his gun. “He ran away from me, tried to hop into my trooper car, grabbed my gun,” the sergeant said. “We were fighting with my gun and I shot him.”
According to Grewal’s office, Gordon ran out of gas twice in the hours before the shooting, with state troopers responding both times. He was also issued a ticket for driving 101 mph in Stafford, New Jersey, about 13 minutes before Wetzel stopped him.
Gordon’s sister, Yanique Gordon, 27, flew with her mother from London to monitor the investigation and to make funeral arrangements for her brother.
She said that she had often spoken out about inequality in England.
But she said that after the deaths of her brother and Floyd, she was increasingly worried about her five half-siblings who are black and live in the United States.
“It really scares the life out of me to think this could happen to them as well,” she said. “The odds are against us as black people in America.”
Yanique Gordon said she was wary of the authorities, and that she wondered what might have happened after Floyd’s death if there was no video evidence depicting it. She said she was similarly worried that her brother’s death might not result in a thorough investigation.
“I have zero trust in the American system,” she said. “There is no accountability. You have to get every single voice screaming and shouting for your rights.”

President Donald Trump on Monday flatly denied that systemic problems existed in American police departments, declaring that as many as 99.9% of the nation’s officers are “great, great people” as he rebuffed mass street protests denouncing racist behavior in law enforcement.
Trump, who has adopted an uncompromising law-and-order posture and scorned demonstrations that have broken out in cities nationwide, surrounded himself with law enforcement officials at the White House and tried to link liberals’ calls to defund the police to his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden — even though Biden came out earlier against defunding the police.
“There won’t be defunding,” Trump said. “There won’t be dismantling of our police. There’s not going to be any disbanding of our police.”
While Trump advisers had hoped to tie Biden together with the protesters to try to hurt him with moderate and independent voters, Biden’s campaign undercut that tactic by announcing that he “does not believe that police should be defunded,” while noting that he “supports the urgent need for reform.”
The back-and-forth highlighted how drastically the campaign has changed in the two weeks since George Floyd died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis. Biden has spent much of that time expressing solidarity with protesters against racial injustice, and on Monday traveled to Houston to meet with Floyd’s family in advance of Tuesday’s funeral. Trump has sought to appeal to his hard-core base with threats to use force in the streets and other harsh language to try to show he has no tolerance for disorder.
Trump called the family of Floyd last month, but he has not met with protest leaders or major African American political figures since the demonstrations erupted. White House officials have explored the possibility of a trip by Trump or Vice President Mike Pence to Minnesota but so far have backed off the idea, recognizing that neither would be welcome by many there.
While aides said Monday that Trump was studying possible proposals for changes to law enforcement, the president himself made little effort to suggest as much during his appearance with law enforcement officials.
“Our police have been letting us live in peace,” he said, “and we want to make sure we don’t have any bad actors in there and sometimes we’ll see some horrible things like we witnessed recently, but I say 99.9 — let’s go with 99% of them — great, great people and they’ve done jobs that are record setting.” Trump took no questions from reporters invited to record the event.
Recent polls indicate that Trump is out of step with many Americans on the protests, some of which have unfolded in Republican-leaning states that voted for him in 2016. A Monmouth University poll released last week found that 76% of Americans — including 71% of white people — called racism and discrimination “a big problem” in the United States, a 26-percentage-point spike since 2015. In that poll and others, majorities of Americans said that demonstrators’ anger was fully justified and that police officers were generally more likely to treat black people unfairly than to mistreat white people.
Trump’s own numbers have been sliding in battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin, and states that supported him four years ago like Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and even Texas appear increasingly in play. The president was so agitated over a new CNN national poll showing him 14 percentage points behind Biden on Monday that he posted online a memo from his own pollster calling surveys by major networks biased against Trump.
Officials at the White House said that Trump wants to focus on a law-and-order message both because he thinks it is his best political option and because it is his instinctive default setting on matters involving the police. Trump has long sought to divide people by race going back to the days when he took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of Latino and African-American teenagers later exonerated in a sensational rape case.
Even as the president has described some protesters as “thugs” and threatened to unleash “vicious dogs” on any who tried to enter White House grounds, advisers have suggested that Trump should give a speech going beyond previous statements or find another way to show that he hears the anger from protesters about police misconduct. Two officials said that there is still a push for Trump to hold “listening” sessions, an idea they have floated since shortly after Floyd was killed.
In private, Trump has been musing about race in America since Floyd’s death and his own response. In a meeting last week with roughly two dozen White House aides, campaign officials and surrogates, Trump expressed unhappiness about Floyd’s killing but immediately said the country needed law and order, according to people who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe his private comments. He said nothing more broadly about police treatment of black people in the United States.
Instead, he meandered as he talked, saying that he had signed legislation overhauling criminal justice in 2018 not because it was an issue that he was passionate about, but because Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, had wanted him to, according to one of the people familiar with what was said.
He also mused about how he has asked people whether they prefer being called “black” or “African American,” an issue he had his campaign research.
At another point, Trump talked about the protesters, questioning whether they were peaceful and citing the fire last week at St. John’s Church, a block from the White House. The fire caused relatively minor damage in a basement but has been seized on repeatedly by Trump and his advisers as a justification for forcibly pushing demonstrators out of the area a day later.
Republicans privately said they saw the cry for defunding as a political gift, one that will alienate middle-of-the-road voters and energize the president’s base. Trump’s advisers on Monday held a media call with Ken Blackwell, the former mayor of Cincinnati, and Carolyn Welsh, a former sheriff in Pennsylvania, to try to link Biden to the issue.
After Biden’s campaign declared that he did not support defunding police, Trump’s aides pressed the matter, calling it a “weak statement” by a staff member. “As the protesters like to say, silence is agreement,” said Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director. “By his silence, Joe Biden is endorsing defunding the police.”
Since Floyd’s death, Biden has urged Congress to pass several measures on policing, such as banning chokeholds and stopping the transfer of military weaponry to police departments. Last year, Biden called for spending hundreds of millions of dollars on community policing programs, including hiring more officers.
Even some of the law enforcement officials invited to meet with Trump urged him to support change. Sheriff Tony Childress of Livingston County in Illinois endorsed mandatory de-escalation training for officers; a ban on all physical restraint on or above the neck and any acts that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain; and requirements that officers render medical aid and intervene when physical force is being inappropriately applied.
“We look forward to working with you to hopefully getting legislation involved in making these things true and making them law,” Childress told Trump.
Trump, who brought no advisers of color with him for his Bible-holding photo op at St. John’s last week, included Ja’Ron Smith, the deputy director of the White House Office of American Innovation, in Monday’s event.
“As an individual, I’ve also had the fear of living in a certain neighborhood or driving certain types of cars as an African American just because of my relationship with the police,” Smith said. “There are a lot of African American males across the country that have stories that they can share.”
But he added that police officers should not be demonized. “We can’t let a few bad apples represent something that is the core of everything we do,” he said.
Attorney General William P. Barr, in an interview with Fox News on Monday, said that the demonstrations were so bad at the end of May that the Secret Service recommended that Trump go to his bunker for safety, contradicting the president’s claim that he went there to check it out.
‘Things were so bad that the Secret Service recommended the President go down to the bunker,” Barr said. “We can’t have that in our country.”

HOUSTON — Most did not know him. But they knew the city that shaped him, and that was enough.
They were black and white, young and old. They were people of prominence like the governor, and they were the diverse, multiethnic workers who had built the country’s fourth-largest city, lacking title but not honor. They waited in the Houston sun for hours to spend the briefest of moments in a hymn-filled sanctuary, to grieve and pray by the body of George Floyd.
They came by the hundreds. And then hundreds more.
“Numbers speak volumes,” said Angie Pickens, 43, a chemical-company worker who stood in line holding a bouquet of flowers to honor the 46-year-old man who has become the latest symbol of police violence in America. “I’m a mother of three sons, so we’re all in this fight together, and that’s why I’m here.”
Floyd was born in North Carolina and died in Minneapolis, but he spent most of his life in Houston, in the hard but proud streets of the city’s 3rd Ward. On Monday, Houston mourned for Floyd at a public viewing that stretched for more than six hours and became not so much a rally or a protest but an open-air memorial for a city’s fallen son.
Some wore crimson and gold — the school colors of the 3rd Ward’s Jack Yates High School, where Floyd was a member of the class of 1993. Others wore masks out of concern for the coronavirus that were emblazoned with Floyd’s dying words, “I can’t breathe.”
The majority were African American, but there was a diversity in the crowd — one young white man held a bouquet of flowers as he stood in line. People held umbrellas, waved fans and sat in a cooling tent as the heat and humidity soaked faces and shirts.
“I’m going to wait in line all day if it’s necessary,” said Charles Edward Jackson, 70, a retired bus driver.
Jackson went to Wheatley High, the longtime rival of Yates High. That connection to Floyd’s life, and anger over Floyd’s death, brought Jackson to the church on Monday.
“I wanted to physically be here to show respect for George Floyd and his family,” Jackson said. “His needless killing by the police, it has to stop. It has to stop or this world is headed to destruction.”
Unlike an earlier memorial service in Minneapolis last week and the funeral that was scheduled for Tuesday in Houston, the viewing on Monday at The Fountain of Praise church was the only time the public could grieve for Floyd in the presence of his body. Other services in recent days were for relatives and invited guests only; at the church on Monday, no tickets or invitations were required.
Those attending parked nearby and then boarded buses that dropped them off at The Fountain of Praise. American flags lined the street outside. More than an hour before the viewing began at noon, there were already more than 100 people in line. Hundreds of others continued to line up outside the church’s glass doors; the line went around a water fountain, down a walkway to the street and then back up the driveway of the parking lot.
From noon to the end of the service shortly after 6 p.m., nearly 6,400 people had walked past Floyd’s coffin, said a spokeswoman for Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center, the funeral home handling the arrangements.
Floyd died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis, as a police officer pinned him to the ground with his knee as Floyd cried out for his mother and pleaded with the officers for help. His death has ignited a protest movement around the country, and his name has become a global chant, a hashtag, a cause.
But he was one of Houston’s own.
Some of those who attended said they were heartbroken by the video and wanted to do something to honor a man who had experienced what so many black men had at the hands of the police, and paid for it with his life. Standing in line to view his body and pay their respects, they said, was the least they could do.
Others felt that Floyd was shaping a change in America, and this was their way of being part of history.
“This is a transformative moment in the country,” said Sheldon DeBraine, 49, who works in workforce development and whose words were muffled by his mask as he stood in line. “I wanted to make sure I supported the moment and I did my part, because this was a great injustice.”
Police officers had a presence in the area, but the mood was somber. The low-key viewing highlighted the ways in which the killing of Floyd has played out differently in Houston than in other cities.
The demonstrations in Houston over Floyd’s death have been largely peaceful and have for the most part not been disrupted by the looting and clashes with police that have occurred in some other cities. Police cars were vandalized and officers made a number of arrests, but protests in Houston were generally civil.
At least one of the reasons has something to do with the police chief in Houston, Art Acevedo, who marched with protesters, changed his department’s Twitter profile picture to an image of Floyd and made a sermon-style speech in which he said he did not “fear walking up to people who are angry, because we join them in their anger.”
Acevedo’s officers escorted Floyd’s body to the funeral home after his remains arrived in Houston on Saturday night.
Acevedo’s department has been no stranger to controversy, particularly after a deadly botched drug raid in 2019 and a string of shootings involving officers. But on Monday, the chief stood for several minutes next to the line of mourners.
“This community knows that we’re not perfect, but they know that we care,” he said. “You cannot build relationships via memo from headquarters. You cannot change culture via memo from behind your desk.”
Gov. Greg Abbott was among the first to pay his respects to Floyd at the church on Monday. He met later with the Floyd family privately, as did Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
“George Floyd is going to change the arc of the future of the United States,” said Abbott, a Republican, who wore a striped crimson-and-gold tie in tribute to Floyd. “I’m here to tell you today that I’m committed to working with the family of George Floyd to ensure we never have anything like this ever occur in the state of Texas.”
Carol Wright, 48, wiped tears from her eyes as she left the church.
“I wasn’t expecting the casket to be open, so that kind of caught me,” said Wright, an information technology consultant from the Houston suburb of Katy. “I was thinking about him calling for his mother and thinking about so many black men I know that age.”
After the viewing, she stood quietly in a line waiting to board a bus back to her car. The top of her mask was getting wet from her tears. Her 11-year-old daughter and her 9-year-old son stood next to her, trying to comfort her. They said very little — just being there for one another in silence seemed to be enough.
All three wore matching white T-shirts. On the front, in bold letters, was a line from a Langston Hughes poem: “I, too, am America.”

Face Masks on the Subway as New York City Begins Reopening [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Commuters wearing face masks gripped coffees and checked phones as they lined up on a subway platform in Manhattan for freshly scrubbed trains that smelled of cleaning solutions.
A half-dozen construction workers waited on a corner in the East Village to have their temperatures checked by a foreman so they could get back to building the city.
“We’ve been home for two months, going a little stir crazy,” said Anthony Gianfrancesco, 45, a construction shop steward.
Neighborhood stores unlocked their doors and prepared to welcome customers. On Fulton Street in Brooklyn, a sidewalk vendor, Sean White, 35, was setting out hats and bags next to a rack of one of his most popular items: masks in leopard prints.
“No mask, no service,” he said, “unless you’re buying one on the spot.”
New York City was officially back in business Monday morning, with as many as 400,000 people returning to work in construction, manufacturing and some retail.
The city was far from normal — the usual surge of people and the cacophony on the streets was still largely absent. But the reopening was a step toward resuming the routines of going to work, shopping and just moving around on the streets and subways after the coronavirus brought nearly everything to a screeching stop.
It was more than three months ago that the first coronavirus case was confirmed in New York City, but for many, it feels so much longer. More than 205,000 people were infected in the city, which became an epicenter of the global outbreak. Nearly 22,000 people died. At the worst, the virus claimed as many as 800 lives in a single day during the worst health crisis in a century.
Now, as city officials try to move forward, one of their biggest challenges will be how to get commuters safely to work and around the city. They have to worry about ensuring public health on a subway system where social distancing is essentially impossible.
In an effort to provide alternatives to the subway, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that the city would install five new busways that would give buses priority on some of the busiest streets in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens — largely by banning cars.
City officials have been under pressure from bus riders and transportation advocates to expand on the city’s first busway, created on 14th Street in Manhattan last fall, to other locations. The busway has led to increased bus speeds.
The city’s reopening came a day after de Blasio lifted a curfew — the city’s first since World War II — on Sunday. The curfew was imposed last week after looters targeted businesses in Manhattan and the Bronx during the protests for racial justice that erupted across the city after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The rat-a-tat of jackhammers could be heard again from construction projects. Manufacturing shops hummed as machines were dusted off and restarted. Retail stores were adjusting to curbside and in-store pickups of merchandise.
Outside Paragon Sports near Union Square, a sign offered color-coded instructions for where to wait for curbside pickup. The store was ready to join in Monday’s reopening even though it had been looted two Sundays ago.
“The next morning, our team swept up the glass and boarded up the windows,” said Zachary Blank, the Paragon Sports chief operating officer. “We kept on track, but it was with the hard work of our entire team that we were able to keep on track.”
The reopening allows 200,000 to 400,000 people to return to city workplaces in the first of a four-phase reopening plan. Subways and buses returned to regular service schedules, although the subway system remains closed overnight. Cars and trucks filled up midtown Manhattan streets that had been largely empty.
On Friday, transit officials had released a sweeping plan to protect public health as a projected 300,000 riders prepared to return to public transportation during the initial phase.
That program included ramping up service, deploying transit workers to enforce mask usage, increasing disinfection, placing floor markings and wall decals to encourage social distancing, and offering free hand sanitizer to riders.
“We have masks in every station, hand sanitizer in every station, the decals are down,” said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of New York City Transit, referring to indicators to encourage social distancing. “Our goal was to go into reopening having built for reopening.
“There is a clear uptick; there are absolutely more people in the system,” she added, referring to ridership Monday morning.
Although the virus remains a threat, new infections have fallen to about 500 a day, or roughly half the number from just weeks ago. City and state officials have significantly expanded testing and hope that newly hired contact tracers — who have been charged with tracking the disease’s spread from person to person — can isolate the virus before it can resurge.
New York City was the last part of the state to reopen, after meeting seven health-related metrics, including a decline in hospitalizations and deaths. Much of upstate New York has moved on to the second phase, which allows most stores, offices and hair salons to open with restrictions.

Full text: Many physicians wish to show solidarity at the demonstrations, but some fear a second wave of infection will follow.
Outside medical centers across the country, doctors and other health care workers have been stopping work in recent days for 8 minutes and 46 seconds to join in protesting the death of George Floyd, who was pinned down by a police officer in Minneapolis for that amount of time before his death.
For doctors in New York who have strained to meet the challenges of coronavirus care for months, participating in the demonstrations has been especially poignant. Workers at a number of the hospitals hit hard by Covid-19 including Bellevue, Downstate, Lincoln, Mount Sinai and Montefiore have held events displaying their support for the protests this week.
Many say they view the deaths of black people at the hands of police as a public health issue. But they also express worries that large gatherings will cause a second wave of Covid-19 cases, and they are balancing their involvement with calls for protesters and police officers to adhere to public health guidelines.
For some black physicians, the protests, like the pandemic, are a reminder of the unequal health risks that black Americans face.
"As a physician, when I hear 'I can't breathe' I'm usually rushing to someone's bedside," said Dr. Teresa Smith, an emergency doctor at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, who thought of her patients with respiratory failure when she saw the video of the killing of Mr. Floyd. "To see George Floyd crying that, that was personal for me as a physician of color."
To Dr. Smith, these protests are all the more important at a time when a public health crisis is disproportionately affecting black patients. Black Americans comprise 13 percent of the population, but 24 percent of deaths from Covid-19.
In New York City, black and Latino people died at twice the rate of white people, according to data released by the city. A study from the city's comptroller found that minorities make up 75 percent of the city's front line workers, and therefore many have not been able to shelter in place.
"The black community has been facing a pandemic that has taken the lives of their family and friends," Dr. Smith said. "Then the community had to wake up to face the deaths of their people by the hands of those who were supposed to protect them. It's a double whammy."

That's part of what motivated Dr. Rob Gore, an emergency physician, to lead more than 100 residents, medical students and nursing staff in a "die-in" on Thursday at SUNY Downstate. Dr. Gore said the action was intended in part to make medical workers imagine they were personally in Mr. Floyd's position. As a black physician, Dr. Gore said he wanted his co-workers to understand the fear of police violence as viscerally as they have felt the threat of Covid-19.
Dr. Oluyemi Omotoso, an emergency medicine resident at Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx, said he could not bring himself to watch the George Floyd video after all the Covid-19 deaths he had witnessed, especially among black patients.
"Seeing clips of it is traumatizing because in the last three months on the front line I kept seeing patients saying they couldn't breathe," Dr. Omotoso said. "I remember one shift where five people were intubated and five people died."
Dr. Omotoso led a solidarity event on Thursday, in which roughly 100 workers at Lincoln Medical Center gathered for a moment of silence and speeches.
But he simultaneously worries that the protests will cause a spike in coronavirus infections.
"The second wave might come sooner than anticipated given what's happening," Dr. Omotoso said. "Like most emergency departments in the city, we're preparing for the worst."
Some public health experts have also warned that the use of tear gas at protests and other police crowd tactics could increase the risk of coronavirus transmission.
"Arresting peaceful protesters and putting them in paddy wagons increases the risk of transmission," said Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency room doctor in New York who has spent recent weeks advising patients and colleagues on how to protest safely, and joined a solidarity event at New York Presbyterian. "There's also no reason to use chemical inhalants that cause people to cough."
Some physicians have used their involvement in the demonstrations to promote social distancing and ensure that protesters are wearing appropriate protective equipment. Dr. Madison Edens, an emergency medicine resident, said she brought masks to hand out at a protest in Union Square at the end of May, and another gathering for health care workers in Times Square on Tuesday.
Dr. Edens said she feels the role of physicians in the protests is important in a period when people are especially reliant on the expertise of the medical community.
"People are looking to doctors more than they usually do," she said. "It's our obligation to stand up and show solidarity even with the risks of gathering at this moment."
Some physicians say the unity they see at demonstrations has been a comfort after months of seeing patients struggling in isolation, as many hospitals have disallowed or strictly limited visitors during the Covid-19 crisis.
"People have been dying by themselves in the hospital," said Dr. Hillary Dueñas, a resident physician at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who helped organize the Times Square event. "To see people gather together in silence was so powerful."

None of the plans for how the nation might safely emerge from the coronavirus lockdown involved thousands of Americans standing shoulder to shoulder in the streets of major cities or coughing uncontrollably when authorities used tear gas to disperse them. No one planned on protesters being herded into crowded prison buses or left in crowded cells.
Before the eruption of outrage over the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, debates about reopening centered on whether states had adequate systems in place to detect and treat cases of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 110,000 people in the United States since the beginning of the year.
But as the protests against police brutality continue for a second week, public officials are warily watching for signs that an unanticipated end to social distancing on a mass scale has led to new cases of the virus. The question has become part of the politicized debate over the economic repercussions of the lockdown, which some critics have argued went too far.
And Sunday, infectious disease experts on Twitter debated how to supply a reliable estimate of the impact of the protests on virus transmission — or whether trying to do so may wrongly be seen as discouraging participation in the growing racial justice movement.
In what he called a back-of-the-envelope estimate, Trevor Bedford, an expert on the virus at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, wrote on Twitter that each day of protests would result in about 3,000 new infections. Over several weeks, as each infected person infected just under one other person on average — the current U.S. transmission rate — those infections would in turn lead to 15,000 to 50,000 more, and 50 to 500 eventual deaths. Given the racial disparities so far in the pandemic, he noted, those deaths will be disproportionately among black people. “Societal benefit of continued protests must be weighed against substantial potential impacts to health,” he wrote.
Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard, agreed that those projections were reasonable, and said in an email that Bedford had done “a service’’ by making an approximate estimate with explicit assumptions.
But he also noted that if states where the virus was still spreading managed to rein it in, that would “massively overshadow the effects of the protests.” About 20,000 new cases are being identified across the country on most days, and about 1,000 new deaths are announced. If all communities were performing enough tests and contact tracing to bring down those numbers, fewer of those acquiring infections at protests would infect others, shortening the transmission chain and reducing the number of eventual deaths.
Bedford wrote that his estimates contained a lot of uncertainty. There is no official estimate for how many people are protesting on an average day, for instance. Still, he thought it was important, he said, to provide a framework grounded in epidemiologic principles to counter the offhand assumptions being made by political pundits. But, in response, other scientists voiced concern that Bedford’s posts would “give fodder to those opposing civil rights.”
Many epidemiologists, including Bedford, have noted in recent days that America’s entrenched racial inequalities themselves translate into disproportionate early deaths and illness among African Americans. That has been especially evident in the coronavirus pandemic, in which black Americans are dying at about twice the rate of white Americans. A group of more than 1,000 people working in health and medicine signed a letter recently that said protests were, in fact, vital to public health.
“Racism and police violence are major threats to public health in this country, and protest is one of the only options available to people who have been systematically disenfranchised,” said Eleanor Murray, an epidemiologist at Boston University.
Because it can take up to two weeks for a newly infected person to show symptoms and the protests started shortly after Floyd’s death, health experts expect that any uptick in cases will begin to surface this week. Demonstrators in several places have contracted the virus, including in Lawrence, Kansas, where someone who attended a protest last weekend tested positive Friday. That person did not wear a mask while protesting, local officials said. In Athens, Georgia, a county commissioner who attended a protest said that she had tested positive.
In Oklahoma, a college football player who participated in a demonstration revealed that he later tested positive for the virus.
“After attending a protest in Tulsa AND being well protective of myself, I have tested positive for COVID-19,” Amen Ogbongbemiga, a linebacker at Oklahoma State University, wrote on Twitter. “Please, if you are going to protest, take care of yourself and stay safe.”
Many did their best. In Califoria, Jarrion Harris, 32, wore a cloth mask for a march in Hollywood on Sunday.
“I’m definitely not out here because I think COVID-19 has gone into the shadows,” he said. “It’s worth the risk.”
Politicians and public health officials have urged demonstrators to wear face coverings and to maintain social distancing. In some places, including Atlanta, Illinois, Los Angeles and Minnesota, officials have also urged protesters to seek coronavirus tests to make sure they have not become infected.
The surge of protests throughout American cities and the seeming support of some political leaders have not gone unnoticed on the right. Pundits and commentators have made the point in recent days that mayors and governors who sternly warned against public gatherings are now giving their blessing to the protests.
Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was appointed by President Barack Obama, tweeted last week that the threat to controlling the coronavirus was “tiny” compared with the threat “created when governments act in ways that lose community trust.”
That struck Jonah Goldberg, a writer for The Dispatch, an online conservative magazine, as an unfair double standard.
“You know what erodes public trust in people like Frieden?” Goldberg wrote. “When they say that you’re a fool or monster who will get people killed for wanting to go to church or keep your business open but you’re a hero when you join a protest they approve of.”
As the virus has spread across the country, many conservatives have rebelled against the stringent measures supported by public health experts, and there have been skirmishes over wearing masks in public, allowing in-person religious services and placing a premium on restoring the economy over other concerns.
If the virus surges again, said Christopher F. Rufo, director of the Center on Wealth and Poverty at the Discovery Institute, a conservative think tank, the experts’ standing will have been undermined. “You’re going to have half the country that has lost faith almost completely in the public health establishment,” he said.
But it may be hard to trace infections to other protesters, who are often marching side by side with strangers. And infectious disease experts have said that any uptick in cases may well be the result of the continued reopening of restaurants, workplaces and mass transit.
In Las Vegas, casinos are reopening. In New York City, long the center of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., as many as 400,000 workers on Monday can begin returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores as the city enters the first phase of its reopening.
“You cannot pin this on the protests,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, whose projections of the virus’ path suggest that U.S. coronavirus deaths will increase in the coming weeks. “The protests are not in and of themselves going to drive the resurgence in cases. This is associated with all the new opportunities that are providing a way for people to get together and pass the virus to one another.”
For their part, activists said the drive to protest in the face of the virus reflected the larger gravity of the moment and the intensity of their passion.
“If I get infected fighting for justice, my soul can sit with that,” said Sara Semi, 27, a protester in Minneapolis who wears a mask with a filter and carries cans of disinfectant spray. “I can’t sit at home protected by my privileges if others aren’t. I can’t sit inside my house safe while my friends and neighbors are not. Yes, corona is happening. It’s real, it’s deadly. But racism kills way more lives.”
Vidal Guzman, 29, a protester in New York, said: “People are more scared of the police than COVID-19. They are willing to do anything.”
Different conditions and the many remaining unknowns about how the virus is transmitted can make it difficult to predict the spread of the virus at any given protest. Outdoor gatherings are much lower risk than indoor ones. How many people are wearing masks, whether they are shouting or using noisemakers and even the weather may all affect the risk of infection.
Still, experts say it is within the power of law enforcement authorities to minimize or eliminate some of the chief risk factors, like arrests and tear gas. And they add that protesters, if they choose to take to the streets, should do everything they can to stay safe.
“If you attended a protest,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said Sunday, “assume you may have been exposed to COVID. Get tested.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council — a veto-proof majority — pledged on Sunday to dismantle the Police Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.
Saying that the city’s policing system could not be reformed, the council members stood before hundreds of people gathered late in the day on a grassy hill and promised to begin the process of taking apart the Police Department as it now exists.
For activists who have been pushing for years for drastic changes to policing, the move represented a turning point that they hope will lead to a transformation of public safety in the city.
“It shouldn’t have taken so much death to get us here,” Kandace Montgomery, the director of Black Visions Collective, said from the stage at the rally. “We’re safer without armed, unaccountable patrols supported by the state hunting black people.”
The pledge in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died 13 days ago after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer’s knee, reflected calls across America to rethink what policing looks like. Protesters have taken to the streets with demands to shrink or abolish police departments, and “defund the police” has become a frequent rallying cry.
Officials in other cities, including New York, have begun to talk of diverting some money and responsibilities from police forces to social services agencies, but no other major city has gone as far in reaction to the protests as the Minneapolis officials have promised to do.
Council members said in interviews on Sunday that they did not yet have specific plans to announce for what a new public safety system for the city would look like. They promised to develop plans by working with the community, and said they would draw on past studies, consent decrees and reforms to policing across the nation and the world.
Protesters who gathered at the windswept rally, with a view of Powderhorn Lake, said what mattered most was that elected officials had finally committed to a sweeping overhaul of policing, even though they had not offered specifics of how a dismantling would work.
“There needs to be change,” said Paola Lehman, a 23-year-old actor and educator in Minneapolis.
As the council members each read a line of the pledge to the crowd, Wintana Melekin, 32, clasped her hands above her head wrap, her mouth open in stunned silence beneath a sagging mask with the inscription “Defund Police.”
“I knew it was happening, but I didn’t believe it,” she said.
When the final portion was read, a roar went up among the hundreds in the crowd. Many people raised their fists in the air and chanted, “Defund MPD!”
Though the City Council controls the police budget, the department answers to Mayor Jacob Frey, who has a veto over the council’s actions. Council members said they had enough votes to override a veto by Frey, who was booed out of a rally by hundreds of people on Saturday after he said he did not believe in abolishing the Police Department. Frey quietly exited through an angry crowd as many shouted “Go home, Jacob Frey!” and “Shame! Shame!”
Councilwoman Alondra Cano, who leads the council’s public safety committee, said that scene made her think about the need to create space for discussions — a truth and reconciliation commission of sorts — to develop solutions to the city’s policing issues.
“Protesting is good and needed, press conferences are good and needed,” she said. “That third space is needed where we are committed to each other, and not the camera.”
Frey said on Sunday that while he opposed dismantling the Police Department, he would “work relentlessly” with the city’s police chief and the community “toward deep, structural reform and addressing systemic racism in police culture.” He added that he was “ready to dig in and enact more community-led public safety strategies.”
The City Council voted on Friday to accept a civil rights investigation of the police by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to amend the Police Department’s use-of-force policy to ban chokeholds, among other measures.
Protesters’ cries to defund or abolish the police are often not meant literally. Rather, they are demands to rethink a law enforcement system from the ground up and to grapple with deeply ingrained issues, including employing officers who do not live in the city they police — as is done in Minneapolis — and sending armed officers to respond to situations that turn out not to be crimes, as when a mentally ill person is in distress.
Some proposals have focused on ending heavy-handed police tactics like no-knock search warrants and military-style raids on the homes of suspects, restricting the flow of military gear to police departments and banning the use of military equipment on protesters.
A common thread has been the tendency of police departments to consume ever larger shares of city budgets.
“We’re really saying we want to grow our community, and we want to invest in the things we actually need,” said Montgomery, who led the protest on Saturday and grilled Frey on his views, leading to the chants that prompted him to leave the scene.
Council members and activists pointed to examples of different styles of policing in places like Austin, Texas, where the operators who answer 911 calls inquire whether a caller needs police, fire or mental health services before dispatching a response, and in Eugene, Oregon, where a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training are dispatched to emergency calls.
Many have called for relying more on self-policing by the community, in the way attendees often do at events like music festivals, with the police stepping in only when a true emergency arises. Some cited as an example how, in the days after the killing of Floyd, teams made up of dozens of members of the American Indian Movement patrolled streets and directed traffic in the Little Earth housing community in Minneapolis.
Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and chair of Reform L.A. Jails, said the move by the Minneapolis City Council members had shifted the movement to rethink policing from the fringe to the mainstream.
“This is massive,” Cullors said. “This is the first time we are seeing, in our country’s history, a conversation about defunding, and some people having a conversation about abolishing the police and prison state. This must be what it felt like when people were talking about abolishing slavery.”
Many advocates note that city budgets are already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down business and tourism, sharply reducing tax revenue, and that police budgets may be especially vulnerable.
The city of Minneapolis is looking to cut $200 million from its $1.3 billion overall budget, according to Lisa Bender, the president of the City Council. She said she hoped to reallocate some money from policing, which received $189 million in the 2020 budget, to other areas of need in the city.
Councilman Jeremiah Ellison, who represents North Minneapolis, said he would not frame what the council was doing as defunding the police, but rather as “funding a different safety strategy.”
He said: “Is the goal to execute some kind of vendetta against MPD? No.”
Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, did not respond to requests for comment.
Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said he supported reforming rather than defunding the police. While he welcomed additional investment in social services for mental health, domestic violence and homelessness, he said, the traditional police force “is an essential service and must still be funded.”
“When someone is in immediate danger, fearing for his or her life, would these victims still have a place to call and a person who is willing and able to help?” he asked. “If so, then we’re open to more discussions.”
Activists have been calling for change in the Minneapolis Police Department for a long time. Outrage over police killings prompted many of the current City Council members to run for office.
“We warned them years ago that this will become the next Ferguson,” Nekima Levy-Armstrong, president of the Racial Justice Network, said of city officials. “They didn’t listen.”
Levy-Armstrong said she was worried about completely abolishing the Police Department, fearing that city leaders would make decisions without sufficient input from minority communities.
“If they want to disband the police,” she said, “they need to come up with ways and methods to keep our people safe.”
After the accusations of police brutality through the years, the failed past attempts at reform and then the horrific footage of Floyd’s killing — as well as the police response to protests that has included rubber bullets and tear gas — major changes to policing in Minneapolis are now inevitable, said Kenza Hadj-Moussa, a spokeswoman for TakeAction Minnesota, an advocacy group.
“No one feels safe calling the police, period,” she said. “They’re not doing their basic function of public safety.”

The apologies keep coming.
After the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, allowed police to use its property to stage a response to a protest over George Floyd’s death, its director asked the police to gather elsewhere and issued a public apology.
When the Getty was criticized for putting out “vague” social media posts calling “for equity and fairness” that failed to mention Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, its chief executive pledged to do better.
The language of contrition was similar from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art after it was criticized for responding to Floyd’s death with an Instagram post: an image of a work by artist Glenn Ligon — who is black — without any statement from the institution.
“We can do better,” the apology said. The museum followed up with a second apology days later for having disabled comments in response to criticism of its initial post.
For decades, cultural organizations have generally opted out of politically heated debates, positioning themselves as neutral territory and preferring to let the artists they present do the opining. As civic institutions often supported by taxpayer dollars, they have historically eschewed political allegiances.
But this time is different.
In the period of protests, many arts organizations have entered the fray. Some of their public messages have been commended as better than silence; others criticized as tone deaf and too little too late.
Such efforts to meaningfully contribute to the conversation are especially sensitive because many of the institutions are led by white executives who answer to boards largely made up of wealthy white trustees. That composition has long fueled suspicion that arts organizations are inherently resistant to — or incapable of — real change.
“It’s not enough to issue these toothless statements,” tweeted Adrianne Russell, a writer, museums specialist and former employee at the Nelson-Atkins, “and that’s why I wish museums would just be quiet unless they’re going to tell the truth.”
When the Metropolitan Opera tweeted last week that there was “no place for racism in the arts,” several people commented on social media that the company had never performed an opera by a black composer. (Their first — Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” — was announced last year but has yet to be performed.)
“I do not think art museums have done enough,” Chris Anagnos, executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors, said in a statement on the organization’s website. “We have dabbled around the edges of the work, but in our place of privilege we will never live up to the statement that ‘museums are for everyone’ unless we begin to confront, examine and dismantle the various structures that brought us to this point.”
Some responses have landed more successfully than others, namely the impassioned statement from Lonnie G. Bunch III, secretary of the Smithsonian, who called on his professional cohort to step up.
“Will we join the struggle to seek justice and equality?” Bunch said. “Will we heed the call of courageous figures throughout history who spoke out against slavery, marched on for voting rights, and sat in for basic equality? Will we challenge the nation to live up to its founding ideals? In the memory of those taken from us and for the good of the country, I hope that we do.”
Other institutions tried a pragmatic approach. In New York, off-Broadway and Brooklyn theaters, as well as the Brooklyn Museum and MoMA PS1, have offered restroom access to protesters. Theaters in cities such as Oakland, California; Austin, Texas; and Washington, have done the same. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture created an online portal for a discussion about race.
The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis announced it would no longer contract the services of the local police department for events until the law enforcement agency “implements meaningful change by demilitarizing training programs, holding officers accountable for the use of excessive force and treating communities of color with dignity and respect.” Four Minneapolis officers were charged in connection with Floyd’s death.
Many organizations that view themselves as enlightened, progressive institutions decided they could no longer sit on the sidelines in order to avoid controversy.
“We are part of that problem — the racism is within us — as institutions that are always telling our audience what’s good art and making choices that set up or reinforce cultural orders,” said Michael Govan, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. “We have an ability to critique and change those orders.”
The conversation about the complacency of arts groups was building long before their recent public statements of solidarity or their posting of black boxes and #BlackoutTuesday on Instagram were judged insufficient.
The Whitney Museum of American Art faced criticism when it featured in its 2017 Biennial exhibition a painting by white artist Dana Schutz of the lynched black teenager Emmett Till, incurring protests. It kept the painting on the wall, saying it raised important questions.
Last year, the museum was the site of multiple demonstrations because one of its trustees, Warren B. Kanders, owns a company that sold the tear gas that was reportedly used on immigrants at the border. He ultimately felt compelled to step down.
Four of the 14 curators now are people of color, and the museum has featured black artists in earnest but acknowledges there is much more to do. “Everybody has to look at themselves and say, ‘We’re all not doing this as well as we should be,’” said Adam D. Weinberg, the museum’s director. “If you don’t have input from other voices, you’re just going to get the same answers.”
Many of these cultural organizations did not respond at all when Amadou Diallo was shot dead by police in the Bronx in 1999 or Michael Brown was killed by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. But this time around, the approach has changed, whether it is because the politics of the moment have triggered advocacy or because the multiple fatal encounters with police can no longer be ignored.
“They’re using language that they’ve never used before in terms of racism and white supremacy,” Melanie A. Adams, director of the Smithsonian’s Anacostia Community Museum, said of museums. She has worked as a facilitator of workshops on topics related to museums and race.
Adams said that she had noticed a shift in museum attitudes after the shooting of Brown and believes some of the change may be attributable to more young activists working in institutions. The challenge, she said, will be sustaining the discussion that currently feels so urgent. “Sometimes with these situations, for the next few months we’ll all wave the social justice flag, and then we’ll go back to our corners,” she said, “I’m hoping that’s not going to be what happens this time.”
Some efforts have been more symbolic. Last Tuesday, the Kennedy Center announced that its lights would be dimmed for nine nights in honor of Floyd, marking the final nine minutes of his life.
Next Saturday, a number of major institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and the Detroit Institute of Arts plan to devote the home pages of their websites to a 24-hour stream of “Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death,” the 2016 video by artist Arthur Jafa.
“No institutional leader has all the answers right now,” said Max Hollein, director of the Met. “There is a moment when you reflect, when you have to listen.”
Hollein learned this lesson the hard way last week when Ligon objected to the use of one of his artworks in the Met’s recent social media post. “I know it’s #nationalreachouttoblackfolksweek but could y’all just stop,” Ligon said on Instagram. “Or ask me first?”
Hollein said he has apologized directly to Ligon.
The Museum of Modern Art will present a special screening of Jafa’s 2018 “akingdoncomethas” — more than 100 minutes of black church services — on June 13 and has posted a list of organizations that fight racism and support equality.
“We can change the stories we tell in the galleries, and we have to do the work to make sure the institution reflects the richness and diversity of our country,” said Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA’s director. “This is a moment of reckoning.”
Many arts leaders agree that the most effective response is institutional change — hiring more staff members of color; diversifying the board; presenting a range of programming.
“We need to revisit deeply everything — our organizational structures, the programs that we value, what exhibitions we should be doing,” said Julián Zugazagoitia, director of the Nelson-Atkins who used to head El Museo del Barrio. “The actions speak more than declaratory statements.”
At the same time, change can cost money and some of the institutions pledging to diversify both their staffs and the moneyed boards that support their work are already facing severe financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Laura Raicovich, the politically outspoken former director of the Queens Museum, is working on a book due out next year, tentatively titled “The Myth of Museums: Why Cultural Institutions Can’t Be Neutral in an Age of Protest.”
In 2018, she stepped down after clashing with her board over an event sponsored by the Israeli government and over what, she believed, was her public support for young immigrants in the country illegally.
She said that museums should abandon the pretense of a united front. “It’s time for institutions to drop the monolithic responses,” she said, “to be more transparent about the different conversations happening inside of a museum.”
James Cuno, president of the Getty Trust, said he was comfortable with having had to revise his museum’s statement in response to criticism. “It was extremely important that our staff brought it to our attention,” he said. “It was the way institutions should work.”
The Guggenheim Museum, which did not have a black curator on staff until last year, has for several months been working with an outside diversity consultant, its director, Richard Armstrong, said. Its statement of support for Blackout Tuesday drew criticism from Chaédria LaBouvier, who organized the Guggenheim’s Basquiat show last year as a guest curator. She has said her experience at the museum was fraught with racism. Among the examples she cited was her exclusion from a museum panel that discussed the exhibition she designed.
Armstrong, speaking broadly in an interview, said that the museum should strive to be an ethical leader but that there invariably would be missteps.
“One of the missing links in our moving forward as a culture is a greater sense of forgiveness. We’ve made mistakes, we’ve tried as much as possible to address them and we will go on making mistakes.”
But some people in the art world are growing tired of what they view as excuses. After the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art apologized for blocking from view a critical comment from a former employee named Taylor Brandon, who is black, two artists, Leila Weefur and Elena Gross, along with the artists’ collective Heavy Breathing and others, decided to pull their work from a residency program. They wanted to send a clear message that the museum needs to address its institutional racism rather than just release statements of solidarity.
“It is their job to figure out how to resolve this problem,” Weefur said. “Do not put the labor solely on the artist.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged for the first time to cut New York City’s police funding, following 10 nights of mass protests against police violence and mounting demands that he overhaul a department whose tactics have caused widespread consternation.
The mayor declined to say precisely how much funding he planned to divert to social services from the New York Police Department, which has an annual budget of $6 billion, representing more than 6% of de Blasio’s proposed $90 billion budget.
De Blasio said the details would be worked out with the City Council in advance of the July 1 budget deadline.
“We’re committed to seeing a shift of funding to youth services, to social services, that will happen literally in the course of the next three weeks, but I’m not going to go into detail because it is subject to negotiation and we want to figure out what makes sense,” de Blasio said.
As recently as Friday, de Blasio expressed skepticism about cutting police funding, even as he noted that all city agencies might face cuts, absent more financial assistance from the federal government.
His Sunday morning reversal was one of two shifts in his stance toward protesters. In the early morning, he announced on Twitter that New York City’s first curfew since World War II would end effectively immediately, a day earlier than planned. He attributed the course correction to his belief that the protests had become more peaceful in recent days.
The mayor’s announcement that he favored the budget cuts represented the latest turn in his fraught relationship with the Police Department.
De Blasio campaigned for the mayoralty in 2013 on promises of reforming the department, which had been embroiled in controversy over its aggressive use of stop-and-frisk in communities of color. He made his wife, who is African American, and his children central to his campaign. But by the time he took office, the use of stop-and-frisk had already fallen dramatically.
During his first year in office, Eric Garner died in a police chokehold on Staten Island, and his final words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for activists across the country.
De Blasio tried to empathize with protesters, telling reporters that he had advised his son, Dante, “on how to take special care” during interactions with officers.
When, later that month, two police officers were fatally shot in Brooklyn while they were sitting in their patrol car, a police union leader said de Blasio had blood on his hands. Police officers turned their backs to the mayor when he attended the officers’ funerals — events that proved to be a turning point in the de Blasio administration, making the mayor more eager to accommodate the department.
Now, de Blasio is facing a possible $9 billion budget gap and significant unrest within his own administration over his handling of both the coronavirus crisis and the mass demonstrations following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd.
Many protesters and observers have accused the Police Department of using violent tactics during the unrest while enforcing the curfew, which began Monday.
The Brooklyn district attorney’s office said Sunday that it was investigating two police officers over their actions during the demonstrations.
One officer was seen on video shoving a female protester, who fell on the street and hit her head. The other officer was seen on video removing a protester’s mask and pepper spraying him.
On Saturday, dozens of employees at the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice signed a statement demanding that de Blasio support several policing reforms, including a ban on the use of chokeholds by police proposed by the City Council. The legislation, which is believed to have a veto-proof majority in the Council, would criminalize the use of chokeholds by law enforcement, making it easier for district attorneys to prosecute infractions.
De Blasio has resisted signing on to the measure unless it includes an exemption for officers in life-threatening situations. He did not address the issue in his announcement Sunday.
The statement from the criminal justice employees said the demonstrations in the streets mandated transformative change.
“As soon as the protests started, we felt such a disconnect, because we’re supposed to be the ones out there figuring this stuff out, we want to effect change and make things better,” said one of the letter’s signatories, who wanted to remain anonymous to protect his job. “We were left leaderless.”
That statement came on the heels of a letter Wednesday, signed by hundreds of former and current staffers, demanding that de Blasio cut Police Department funding by $1 billion.
In an apparent effort to quell rising internal unrest, on Saturday morning, de Blasio sent an email to staff assuring them that he and his wife, Chirlane McCray, understand “how deeply this moment hurts.”
“We are here for you,” reads the letter, which was acquired by The New York Times. “We will never stop fighting for you. Black Lives Matter in New York City.”
On Sunday, de Blasio’s chief of staff, Emma Wolfe, organized a remote meeting between the mayor, McCray and staff members.
De Blasio and his wife arrived 15 minutes late to the video conference meeting, one attendee said. McCray spoke first. According to an audio recording of the event, she and de Blasio repeated many of the same points they’ve made in more public settings: that they have been facing a perfect storm of challenges; that de Blasio, above all, wanted to prevent any protest-related deaths; and that more police officers will face disciplinary measures.
“It may be true to say that no people in government have ever dealt with so complex and so deep a challenge,” de Blasio said.
De Blasio didn’t take any questions directly from staff members, but did respond to some questions that his spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said deputy mayors solicited from staff in advance.
“Government is incredibly hard,” he told the employees.
De Blasio’s assertion Sunday that he would redirect some police funding was met with skepticism from both protesters and police leaders. He paired the proposal with a handful of other ideas, including removing street vendor enforcement from the Police Department’s purview. Advocates for vendors, many of whom are immigrants, have long accused the city of harassing the vendors. In November, police sparked a firestorm of criticism when they arrested a woman for selling churros on the subway.
He also affirmed his support for an effort to replace a state civil rights law known as Section 50-A, a law that his administration says requires it to protect the confidentiality of police disciplinary records.
It took five years for de Blasio’s police department to fire Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a chokehold, after a police administrative judge found that the officer had violated a department ban on chokeholds.
Given that history, critics are skeptical that de Blasio’s vow to cut funding for the Police Department would amount to anything substantive, or that it came from the heart.
“I hope he’s not trying to make it seem as if that was his calling,” said Anthony Beckford, president of Black Lives Matter Brooklyn, which has called for at least $1 billion to be cut from the department. “That was basically one of our major demands, one of many, but we were specific on numbers.”
“He’s trying to thread this needle where he can sound like he’s meeting the demands and not actually do it,” said Anthonine Pierre, deputy director of the Brooklyn Movement Center and an advocate for overhaul of the police.
Ed Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, a police union, expressed doubt that de Blasio would stick to his stance, too.
“I know he just recently said that he wasn’t going to do that,” Mullins said. “I guess, let’s see what he says on Monday and what his next decision is going to be.”

For Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, a Stinging Rebuke [With graphic(s)]

Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis retreated on Saturday through a sea of protesters yelling, “Go home, Jacob, go home!” and “Shame! Shame!” after he refused to commit to defunding the Police Department.
The scene in Minneapolis, which ricocheted across social media, reflected the intense pressure protesters nationwide are putting on elected officials to commit to sweeping changes in the nation’s law enforcement system after the death of George Floyd nearly two weeks ago.
Frey, a 38-year-old civil rights lawyer, swept into office in 2018 on promises to fix the broken relationship between the community and the police.
Across the country, calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments have gained new traction since Floyd, a 46-year-old black man from Minneapolis, died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes.
On Wednesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles announced that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the Police Department’s budget. And in New York, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Daniel Dromm, a council member from Queens, vowed even before the latest protests to cut the Police Department’s $6 billion budget.
In Minneapolis, at least four members of the City Council have called for dismantling the Police Department, where four former officers have been charged in Floyd’s death.
“And when we’re done, we’re not simply gonna glue it back together,” Jeremiah Ellison, a member of the City Council, said on Twitter this week. “We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response.”
On Saturday, Frey was pressed to state his position on the issue by protesters who had massed outside his house.
Looming above the mayor on a stage, a woman with a microphone asked him if he would commit on the spot to defunding the Minneapolis Police Department.
“It is a yes or no,” she said, instructing the crowd to be quiet and reminding them that the mayor is up for reelection next year. “And if he says no, guess what we’re going to do next year,” she said, adding an expletive for emphasis.
She then handed the microphone to Frey, who said in a barely audible voice muffled by his face mask, “I do not support the full abolition of the police.”
With that, the protesters began their chants of “Go home, Jacob, go home!” and “Shame! Shame!”
On Sunday, Frey said in a phone interview that after he walked away from the protesters chanting it at him, he stayed for about 45 minutes answering questions from reporters and others.
He emphasized again that while he doesn’t support abolishing the Police Department, he supported “deep structural reform of a racist system.” Asked what such reforms might include, he mentioned overhauling collective bargaining by the city’s police union.

NEW YORK — Exactly 100 days since its first case of the coronavirus was confirmed, New York City, which weathered extensive hardship as an epicenter of the worldwide outbreak, is set to take the first tentative steps toward reopening its doors Monday.
Getting here took the sacrifice of millions of New Yorkers who learned to live radically different lives. More than 205,000 have been infected, and nearly 22,000 have died.
As many as 400,000 workers could begin returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores in the city’s first phase of reopening— a surge of normalcy that seemed almost inconceivable several weeks ago, when the city’s hospitals were at a breaking point and as many as 800 people were dying from COVID-19 on a single day.
Many retail stores, battered by months of closure, are readying to do business again Monday, starting with curbside and in-store pickup. Construction companies are adding safety features and stockpiling masks and gloves. Manufacturers, whose shop floors have idled since March, are testing machines.
State and city officials said they were optimistic that the city would begin to spring back to life. Testing is robust and growing, reaching 33,000 people on a recent day. And new infections are now down to around 500 a day — half as many as there were just a few weeks ago.
That is low enough for New York City’s corps of contract tracers, who began work last week, to try to track every close interaction and, officials hope, stop a resurgence of the virus.
“You want to talk about a turnaround — this one, my friends, is going to go in the history books,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.
New York City, like nine other regions in the state, was required to meet seven health-related metrics before beginning reopening. New York City was the last part of the state to do so; much of upstate has already moved on to Phase 2, which allows most stores, offices and hair salons to open, with restrictions on capacity and social distance.
The road back will undoubtedly be challenging. More than 885,000 jobs vanished during the outbreak, and strong gains are not expected for the city until 2022. The city budget hemorrhaged tax revenue and now faces a $9 billion shortfall over the next year.
And the reopening has been complicated by the vast protests for racial justice that have swept the city for more than a week and have forced government officials and business owners to unexpectedly adjust their plans.
Hundreds of stores were burglarized by looters who took advantage of the protests to prey on commercial districts from Midtown to the Bronx. Shop owners scrambled to cover windows in plywood rather than reaching for welcome banners. Police officers enforced a nightly curfew.
“We were planning to make a lot of noise saying, ‘Hey, we’re back,’” said Ken Giddon, a co-owner with his brother of Rothmans, a small clothing chain with a flagship near Union Square. “Now we don’t think that would be appropriate. I think New York City needs a week or two of healing before a week or two of selling.”
In areas hit hard by looters in high-end retail neighborhoods of Manhattan, some stores were not planning to open Monday. The executive director of the business improvement group in SoHo declined to even discuss reopening in the neighborhood.
On Sunday morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he was lifting the 8 p.m. curfew a day early because the city had been relatively calm Saturday. The curfew had been scheduled to expire at 5 a.m. Monday, just as the reopening begins.
Even before the protests, some public health officials were privately fretting that the timeline set by Cuomo and de Blasio was too ambitious. They worried that infections could increase as people returned to work and commuters began to take the subway again.
But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it did not believe that rush hour would meaningfully return Monday — or anytime soon. Even when schools and Broadway are allowed to open in the fourth and final phase of the reopening, the authority is projecting ridership will be under 70%.
One person briefed on the authority’s planning said officials there expected the trains to be at well below 50% capacity at least through Labor Day — a calculation based on the idea that many office workers would continue to work remotely into the fall.
Many business leaders, particularly those in office-based jobs like technology and finance, are watching the transit system for signs that it is safe. The authority has embarked on large-scale cleanings and required riders to wear masks but said social distancing may not be possible if subways and buses carry anywhere close to their normal loads.
The city has yet to offer alternatives for how to move millions of commuters around. De Blasio suggested that many may drive. Urban planners and transit experts cautioned, however, that few would have that option and criticized de Blasio for not offering a street-level transit plan for easing commutes in the next phases of reopening.
City Hall said Friday it was working with the MTA to expand bus service and create new bus lanes around the city.
As many as 32,000 construction sites could open as of Monday, according to the city, the biggest part of the initial phase of reopening. The protests were not altering preparations, said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York.
LaBarbera, whose group represents unions for more than 100,000 workers, said his focus was on making sure workers would be safe when they return, with masks and other protective equipment available and construction sites reconfigured to allow distancing, health checks and hand-washing.
“In the construction industry, by the nature of the tasks that are at hand, it’s not always possible to social distance,” he said.
The unions reached an agreement with contractors and developers to mitigate risk, he said, including staggered shifts, altered start times and more flexible hours, like a four-day workweek with 10-hour days.
Some construction work was deemed essential early on and continued through the state’s pause. Many manufacturers, particularly those that made protective gear and medical equipment, have also been operating.
But many shops were dormant for months. That was true for Roberto Gil, owner of a small furniture-making business, Casa Kids, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. He said he left his shop suddenly back in March, leaving trash and bits of wood strewed about.
Over the past week, he has been cleaning up, painting, tuning machines and holding meetings with his handful of employees to go over rules for wearing masks, hand-washing and how to safely take lunch.
“Monday, we’re going to start with three or four people in the shop,” he said, adding that he would likely add more people to fulfill a backlog of orders.
“Once they’re in the shop — my shop is big — they have plenty of space to work,” he said, referring to distancing measures.
Gil said he was more concerned for his workers at lunch and during commutes and had arranged with one to start earlier or leave later to avoid rush hour.
Some businesses are taking it slowly and carefully.
Only about one-third of textile workers in the city are expected to be back at work Monday, said Edgar Romney, the secretary-treasurer of their union, Workers United/Service Employees International Union. Businesses that are operating have altered their shifts to reduce crowding and installed plastic shields to separate tightly packed sewing machines.
But many, particularly in midtown Manhattan, have remained closed, he said.
For retailers, the picture is even more complex. Just opening the doors does not guarantee that customers will return. Curbside pickup does not make a lot of sense for many retailers either, particularly in Manhattan.
Business groups said many retailers were waiting for the next phase to venture out — when outdoor dining is allowed, office workers are permitted to return, and shoppers are able to enter and browse around all types of stores, local business groups said.
The earliest that could begin would be late June, based on state mandates that each phase last at least two weeks. But de Blasio said Thursday that he did not anticipate the city moving into the next phase until early July.
“Businesses can be ready, but are the consumers ready?” asked Thomas Grech, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce. “I want to demonstrate to the buying public, to the consumers out there, that the businesses are making it safe.”
When more than 100 workers return next week to New Lab, a technology hub in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, they will have the option of wearing a device that buzzes every time two colleagues get too close to each other — a high-tech way to enforce social distancing.
The devices, made by StrongArm Technologies, a company based in the hub, were already being worn by most of the 80 or so workers deemed essential.
“In the first week, people were getting buzzed all the time,” said Shaun Stewart, chief executive of New Lab. “It flashes and it vibrates. That alone — that immediately changes your behavior and your perspective on distancing.”
The city’s contact tracing efforts are far less high-tech. But for the past week, newly infected New Yorkers have been receiving calls from the new corps of tracers. City Hall did not provide figures for how many people they were able to reach.
“The beginning of any program is challenging,” said Jay Varma, an adviser to de Blasio on public health. But so far, he said, “people are willing to participate; they’re willing to give information about their health conditions and about their close contacts.”
Still, a jump in cases could overwhelm the system, as happened at the start of the pandemic in New York in March.
Officials are watching barometers of the virus’ spread closely, from new positive tests to emergency room data, for any sign that the newly flattened curve of infection might be arcing upward again.
The work of contact tracing has taken on new urgency because of the public outpouring of anger at the death of George Floyd, a black man killed in Minneapolis on May 25 in a confrontation with four police officers.
The killing, captured on video, sparked the nation’s largest protest movement in more than a generation. It also raised questions about how mass gatherings might spread the virus, with some participants not observing social distancing.
“On the public health side, this has been a really long, arduous nearly 100 days of something none of us had never dealt with before; and then you see that activity. Of course you’re concerned,” said Jim Malatras, a close adviser to Cuomo. “The top blew off. The top blew off across this country.”
Malatras said he envisioned several possible results of the demonstrations.
People who are asymptomatic could transmit the disease far beyond the ranks of the protesters. Or, if there is no immediate surge of infections, some New Yorkers may begin to doubt strict adherence to social distancing.
The impact of having crowds of at least 20,000 protesters on the streets would not be apparent for as long as two weeks, officials cautioned.
“The mayor is appropriately concerned about the risk of a resurgence due to the mass gatherings that have occurred,” said Varma, adding that “there is a lot that we don’t know about how people’s behavior will change after June 8.”
He said, however, that because the protests took place outdoors and many demonstrators wore masks, the risks may have been lessened.
The state and the city will not make a decision about moving to the second phase of reopening for at least two weeks, at which point the public health effects of the protests should be more clear, officials said.

Full text: Elements of the package, to be unveiled on Monday by House and Senate Democrats, are certain to meet with opposition from police unions and their allies.
Democrats in Congress plan to unveil expansive legislation on Monday that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated the constitutional rights of civilians, and step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement.
The bill, which House and Senate Democrats have named the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, is a direct response to the recent killings of three black Americans by white civilians and officers that have prompted protests across the country, but it includes policies that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades to combat racial bias and excessive use of force by law enforcement. The New York Times obtained a copy of a section-by-section summary of its contents, circulated privately on Capitol Hill late Friday.
It would be the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory, and elements of it are certain to meet with staunch opposition from politically powerful police unions and other law enforcement groups that have fought against such efforts in the past. It is not clear whether President Trump, who often aligns himself with law enforcement and has advocated the use of brutal police tactics, will embrace such measures now.
As currently proposed, it would significantly change federal law and require states and localities to make modifications of their own, such as instituting mandatory bias training, to receive federal funds. It would create a national registry to track police misconduct and require that law enforcement agencies report data on the use of force, as well as ban certain chokeholds and other practices that were used in confrontations with the police that left black Americans dead.
"Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community," House and Senate Democrats who assembled the package wrote in an email to colleagues on Friday accompanying the summary. "Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies."
The effort is being led by Representative Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the only two black Democrats in the Senate. They cited the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky that have inspired protests across the country, as well as other well-known victims of such force in recent years.
"While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing -- it's time we create structural change with meaningful reforms," the lawmakers wrote.
The text of the bill was still being drafted on Saturday and could change before Monday's unveiling, as could the legislation's title.
Individual lawmakers in both parties have introduced their own proposals in recent days that the House and Senate could still consider going forward, but the bill by Ms. Bass and the others has the imprimatur of Democratic leadership in the House and Senate, as well as the influential black caucus. Democrats believe they will be able to swiftly pass it in the House, but prospects are less clear in the Senate, where the Republican majority is likely to pursue a narrower set of changes.
Because most police departments are under state and local control, there are limits to the kinds of changes Congress can mandate from Washington. Calls from activists to break up or drastically restructure police departments, for instance, are more likely to be answered at the state and local level.
Still, the changes Democrats are proposing would be significant.
If adopted, the bill would rewrite key elements of the federal criminal code related to police misconduct to make it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers and for individuals who are victims of such practices to recover damages.
The federal police misconduct statute currently makes it a crime for an officer to "willfully" violate an individuals's constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. Democrats plan to propose lowering that standard of criminal intent to "knowingly or with reckless disregard." The change is likely to face opposition from police unions and their allies.
The legislation would also alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.
In addition, Democrats are proposing to change the federal standard for the use of force by officers from "reasonableness" to only when it is "necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury." The bill would require that federal officers use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort. Grants to state and local agencies would require them to do the same.
In federal drug cases, lawmakers intend to propose banning "no knock" warrants, which allow police to enter a residence without warning or identifying themselves, and incentivize states to do the same. Ms. Taylor was shot and killed in her home during such a raid.
The legislation would also ban chokeholds or other carotid holds, and condition law enforcement funds on states and other agencies doing the same. The technique led to Mr. Floyd's death, prosecutors have said, and the high-profile death in 2014 of Eric Garner in New York.
It would also limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments.
It would give new power to Justice Department investigators conducting inquiries into patterns or practices of behavior by police departments that violate the Constitution and incentivize state attorneys general to conduct such investigations on their own.
Lawmakers would require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras and use dashboard cameras, which have been crucial tools to holding officers accountable in many cases, and they would mandate that state and local agencies use federal funds to "ensure" their use.
Democrats would also try to prod state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new effort to end discrimination in their practices, by conditioning federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat racial and other discriminatory profiling.
The bill would also impose new requirements on the Justice Department to assemble and promulgate new policing standards for state and local agencies and collect reams of data on police actions all over the country that could inform more changes in the future, particularly when a Democratic administration controls the department.
The bill would also include a provision, held up in the Senate, that would make lynching a new federal hate crime for the first time in American history.

Full text: More than 100 police officers, firefighters and other supporters crowded outside the courthouse in Buffalo to protest the assault charges filed against the officers.
Two Buffalo police officers were charged on Saturday with felony assault after a video showed officers shoving a 75-year-old man who was protesting outside City Hall on Thursday night, officials said.
"We had two of our police officers who crossed the line," the Erie County district attorney, John J. Flynn, told reporters after the arraignment. "My job is to prosecute those who have violated the law, plain and simple. And I believe, and I'm alleging, that these two officers violated the law."
Prosecutors identified the officers as Aaron Torgalski, 39, and Robert McCabe, 32. They pleaded not guilty and were released on personal recognizance.
The charges were filed after a widely viewed video taken by WBFO, a local radio station, showed two police officers appearing to shove Martin Gugino, who has been identified as an activist and a member of the Western New York Peace Center who was attending a protest stemming from the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Mr. Gugino, who was shoved after he approached officers, staggered backward and landed hard on the sidewalk. Blood was seen immediately pooling behind his head.
The two officers were suspended without pay, a move that incited outrage from the rank and file. The president of the officers' union, the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association, told The Buffalo News that the city's actions led all 57 officers on the Emergency Response Team to quit the unit.
Officers Torgalski and McCabe were assigned to the team, a special squad formed to respond to riots.
John Evans, president of the union, told WIVB-TV that the charges were "totally unwarranted" and thanked the police, firefighters and others who showed up to the courthouse to support the two men.
"It was tremendous, tremendous to see," Mr. Evans said. "I just think it's a strong indication of the outrage basically over this travesty."
Prosecutors said the officers appeared in court on Saturday morning after their lawyers were told about the charges against them.
The video of the incident spread rapidly across social media, fueling outrage over the growing body of videos showing officers responding to protests against police violence with more police violence.
The fury only intensified when the Police Department first claimed that Mr. Gugino "tripped and fell," a description at direct odds with the video.
Mr. Flynn, the district attorney, said that if Mr. Gugino was violating curfew and refused to move, officers should have moved to arrest him.
"You don't take a baton and shove him," he said, noting that the other officer shoved Mr. Gugino with his right hand, knocking him down. "That's what you don't do. You properly arrest him if he was committing a crime."
Mr. Flynn said Mr. Gugino was still hospitalized and in serious condition.
Under New York law, a person who attacks someone 65 or older and is more than 10 years younger than the victim can be charged with felony assault, Mr. Flynn said. If convicted, the officers face up to seven years in prison.
During the arraignment, supporters gathered outside the courthouse, some of them holding the American flag. Others wore T-shirts that said "BPD Strong."
A handful of counterprotesters showed up with megaphones, chanting, "Support good cops, not bad cops." One counterprotester chanted, "Don't push old men." The crowd of police supporters stared back at them but remained peaceful.
When Officers Torgalski and McCabe left the courthouse, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. Some appeared to hold up a sheet to shield the men from news cameras.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Saturday commended city and county officials for suspending and charging the officers.
"I think there was criminal liability, from what I saw on the video," he said. "I applaud them for acting as quickly as they did. There is no tolerance for delaying justice in society anymore."
Mr. Cuomo added: "What we saw was horrendous and disgusting, and I believe, illegal."
In Buffalo, Stefan I. Mychajliw, comptroller of Erie County, posted a video of himself on Twitter outside the courthouse, where he said he stood in solidarity with the Buffalo police. He called politicians who weren't supporting officers "cowardly."
"Right now, we need strong leaders who believe in the rule of law," said Mr. Mychajliw, who is running for a congressional seat in a district that includes the Buffalo suburbs. "Right now, radical progressives are attacking police and they want chaos and they want anarchy. Enough is enough."

Torgalski and McCabe were assigned to the team, a special squad formed to respond to riots.
John Evans, president of the union, told WIVB-TV that the charges were “totally unwarranted” and thanked the police, firefighters and others who showed up to the courthouse to support the two men.
“It was tremendous, tremendous to see,” Evans said. “I just think it’s a strong indication of the outrage basically over this travesty.”
Prosecutors said the officers appeared in court Saturday morning after their lawyers were told about the charges against them.
The video of the incident spread rapidly across social media, fueling outrage over the growing body of videos showing officers responding to protests against police violence with more police violence.
The fury only intensified when the Police Department first claimed that Gugino “tripped and fell,” a description at direct odds with the video.
Flynn, the district attorney, said that if Gugino was violating curfew and refused to move, officers should have moved to arrest him.
“You don’t take a baton and shove him,” he said, noting that the other officer shoved Gugino with his right hand, knocking him down. “That’s what you don’t do. You properly arrest him if he was committing a crime.”
Flynn said Gugino was still hospitalized and in serious condition.
Under New York law, a person who attacks someone 65 or older and is more than 10 years younger than the victim can be charged with felony assault, Flynn said. If convicted, the officers face up to seven years in prison.
During the arraignment, supporters gathered outside the courthouse, some of them holding the American flag. Others wore T-shirts that said “BPD Strong.”
A handful of counterprotesters showed up with megaphones, chanting, “Support good cops, not bad cops.” One counterprotester chanted, “Don’t push old men.” The crowd of police supporters stared back at them but remained peaceful.
When Torgalski and McCabe left the courthouse, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. Some appeared to hold up a sheet to shield the men from news cameras.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday commended city and county officials for suspending and charging the officers.
“I think there was criminal liability, from what I saw on the video,” he said. “I applaud them for acting as quickly as they did. There is no tolerance for delaying justice in society anymore.”
Cuomo added, “What we saw was horrendous and disgusting and, I believe, illegal.”
In Buffalo, Stefan Mychajliw, comptroller of Erie County, posted a video of himself on Twitter outside the courthouse, where he said he stood in solidarity with the Buffalo police. He called politicians who weren’t supporting officers “cowardly.”
“Right now, we need strong leaders who believe in the rule of law,” said Mychajliw, who is running for a congressional seat in a district that includes the Buffalo suburbs. “Right now, radical progressives are attacking police, and they want chaos, and they want anarchy. Enough is enough.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Democrats in Congress plan to unveil expansive legislation on Monday that would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct and recover damages from officers found to have violated the constitutional rights of civilians, and step up pressure on the Justice Department to address systemic racial discrimination by law enforcement.
The bill, which House and Senate Democrats have named the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, is a direct response to the recent killings of three black Americans by white civilians and officers that have prompted protests across the country, but it includes policies that civil rights activists have been pushing for decades to combat racial bias and excessive use of force by law enforcement. The New York Times obtained a copy of a section-by-section summary of its contents, circulated privately on Capitol Hill late Friday.
It would be the most aggressive intervention into policing by Congress in recent memory, and elements of it are certain to meet with staunch opposition from politically powerful police unions and other law enforcement groups that have fought against such efforts in the past. It is not clear whether President Donald Trump, who often aligns himself with law enforcement and has advocated the use of brutal police tactics, will embrace such measures now.
As currently proposed, it would significantly change federal law and require states and localities to make modifications of their own, such as instituting mandatory bias training, to receive federal funds. It would create a national registry to track police misconduct and require that law enforcement agencies report data on the use of force, as well as ban certain chokeholds and other practices that were used in confrontations with the police that left black Americans dead.
“Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community,” House and Senate Democrats who assembled the package wrote in an email to colleagues on Friday accompanying the summary. “Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies.”
The effort is being led by Rep. Karen Bass of California, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the only two black Democrats in the Senate. They cited the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky that have inspired protests across the country, as well as other well-known victims of such force in recent years.
“While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing — it’s time we create structural change with meaningful reforms,” the lawmakers wrote.
The text of the bill was still being drafted on Saturday and could change before Monday’s unveiling, as could the legislation’s title.
Individual lawmakers in both parties have introduced their own proposals in recent days that the House and Senate could still consider going forward, but the bill by Bass and the others has the imprimatur of Democratic leadership in the House and Senate, as well as the influential black caucus. Democrats believe they will be able to swiftly pass it in the House, but prospects are less clear in the Senate, where the Republican majority is likely to pursue a narrower set of changes.
Because most police departments are under state and local control, there are limits to the kinds of changes Congress can mandate from Washington. Calls from activists to break up or drastically restructure police departments, for instance, are more likely to be answered at the state and local level.
Still, the changes Democrats are proposing would be significant.
If adopted, the bill would rewrite key elements of the federal criminal code related to police misconduct to make it easier to prosecute law enforcement officers and for individuals who are victims of such practices to recover damages.
The federal police misconduct statute currently makes it a crime for an officer to “willfully” violate an individual’s constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. Democrats plan to propose lowering that standard of criminal intent to “knowingly or with reckless disregard.” The change is likely to face opposition from police unions and their allies.
The legislation would also alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that shields police officers from being held legally liable for damages sought by citizens whose constitutional rights were violated.
In addition, Democrats are proposing to change the federal standard for the use of force by officers from “reasonableness” to only when it is “necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury.” The bill would require that federal officers use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort. Grants to state and local agencies would require them to do the same.
In federal drug cases, lawmakers intend to propose banning “no knock” warrants, which allow police to enter a residence without warning or identifying themselves, and incentivize states to do the same. Taylor was shot and killed in her home during such a raid.
The legislation would also ban chokeholds or other carotid holds, and condition law enforcement funds on states and other agencies doing the same. The technique led to Floyd’s death, prosecutors have said, and the high-profile death in 2014 of Eric Garner in New York.
It would also limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments.
It would give new power to Justice Department investigators conducting inquiries into patterns or practices of behavior by police departments that violate the Constitution and incentivize state attorneys general to conduct such investigations on their own.
Lawmakers would require all uniformed federal officers to wear body cameras and use dashboard cameras, which have been crucial tools to holding officers accountable in many cases, and they would mandate that state and local agencies use federal funds to “ensure” their use.
Democrats would also try to prod state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new effort to end discrimination in their practices, by conditioning federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat racial and other discriminatory profiling.
The bill would also impose new requirements on the Justice Department to assemble and promulgate new policing standards for state and local agencies and collect reams of data on police actions all over the country that could inform more changes in the future, particularly when a Democratic administration controls the department.
The bill would also include a provision that would make lynching a new federal hate crime for the first time in American history.

Dismantling Law 50-a Is the First Step in Police Reform [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — At some point, history may show us that after years of aggression, after so much brutality that suggested so little fear of repercussion, it took the looting of Chanel, the reversion of SoHo to a wasteland, to disable a law that has made real police accountability so difficult in New York City. It required a political class moved by fear — of disorder and desecration — rather than compelled by the logic of justice, which had been apparent for so long.
The law, known by its identification in the state’s civil code — 50-a — has protected habitually delinquent police officers for decades. However unlikely it would have been just a few weeks ago, 50-a now faces the overdue prospect of erasure.
For several years, there has been no work more vital to ending police brutality than abolishing laws and policies that weaken transparency and soften repercussion. Chief among them are the statutes, like 50-a, that enshrine police misconduct in secrecy, shielding the personnel and disciplinary records of police officers from public view so that there is often no way for a victim, or his family, to know if an abusive officer has a history of dubious behavior.
Many officers dispatched to the protests last week concealed their badge numbers with strips of elastic or electrical tape. The department said that these were mourning bands, worn to honor colleagues who have died from COVID-19, but a civil liberties group demanded they be removed so that bad actors could be easily identified. In some sense, the law makes any attempt at obscuring unnecessary. Protesters who had their masks pulled off by officers or were shoved to the ground would not be able to find out whether they had ever done anything similar in the past anyway.
Two years ago, a BuzzFeed News investigation, based on hundreds of pages of leaked internal police files, revealed that between 2011 and 2015, dozens of officers were discovered to have used excessive force, or fired guns unnecessarily, or fixed tickets, or sexually harassed someone but kept their jobs regardless. In most instances they suffered only minor punishments. When information like this is kept from public scrutiny, it means that a person who is arrested has no way of knowing if the arresting officer has a record of transgressions, crucial details a jury might find relevant in any potential criminal or civil case.
California used to have the most restrictive law of this kind in the country until two years ago, when the State Legislature dismantled it; now that distinction belongs to New York. This past week, however, as any prior justification for keeping it disintegrated, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that he would support a repeal of 50-a if legislators returned to session to pass it. In recent months, it hadn’t even come up for a vote.
Over the past several years, it had fallen to a relatively small group of advocates from the Legal Aid Society in New York and a group called Communities United for Police Reform to lobby for the repeal of 50-a, a campaign that has failed to capture public attention in the way that bail reform managed to do, for example.
More dispiriting to advocates still was the incongruity in Mayor Bill de Blasio’s position. Although he ran for office on an agenda of police reform, he has not only neglected to make any impassioned effort to repeal the law, but has worked instead to expand its power. “It’s certainly as bad as it was under Giuliani and Bloomberg,” Joo-Hyun Kang, director of Communities United for Police Reform, said of the law’s application. “And in some cases it is actually worse.”
Even now, amid such dire and dramatic urgencies for change, the mayor has resisted speaking out in ardent favor of a full repeal of the law, maintaining instead that the statute should be amended and “replaced.” He has argued that personal information, like the home address of an officer, should never be made easily available. Few would suggest that it should. But to the extent that any such safeguards are actually possible in the age of Google, other elements of public-information law, where redaction is common, already address the problem.
Privacy regulations around police conduct originated for the most part during the high-crime era of the 1970s and were steeped in sound intentions. They arose at the insistence of police unions, which sought to protect officers from efforts to discredit their testimony on witness stands as well as various forms of retaliation. At the moment that 50-a came under review in 1976, a prosecutor named Joseph P. Hoey was virtually alone in opposing the legislation — on the grounds that it could eventually sow public mistrust.
De Blasio’s unwavering defense of the Police Department, as officers plowed into protesters and freely dispensed pepper spray last week, surprised many New Yorkers. But in the mayor’s commitment to privacy shields, his loyalties have been quite clear. Four years ago, the Legal Aid Society sued the city in order to obtain a summary of claims and disciplinary actions against Daniel Pantaleo, the officer whose chokehold led to the death of Eric Garner in 2014.
Pantaleo remained on the force for five years after the tragedy. When a judge ruled in favor of Legal Aid, the city did not honor the decision and release the documents but instead chose to appeal it. Pantaleo was eventually dismissed, but not before paperwork pertaining to the case was leaked to the website ThinkProgress, indicating that there had been a litany of misconduct complaints filed against him, including charges of abusive stop-and-frisk tactics. City officials did not respond passively. To the contrary, a city watchdog agency opened an investigation to uncover the identity of the leaker and then forced the person to resign, a decision supported by the mayor.
Even now, many questions about the Garner case have gone unanswered. Last year, Alvin Bragg, the state’s former deputy attorney general and one of the directors of the New York Law School’s Racial Justice Project, sued the city in the hope of acquiring some of those details: which officers were actually present at the arrest, what their histories were and so on. The de Blasio administration moved to dismiss the petition earlier this year. The airing of mass grief and fury that has erupted now has once again revealed the modern American city to be a locus of self-delusion. Smug in its refinements, convinced of its enlightenment, it has sanctioned barbarism in the name of order and civility over and over, marrying earnest rhetoric to insidious accommodation.
The dynamic works at the personal level as well, in the psychology of a familiar urban type — the devoted progressive who, in the sacred name of localism, will arrive at the farmers’ market every Saturday from the first blueberries through root-vegetable season but fail to show up for the small-bore elections and community proceedings that can genuinely lead to change in the way that municipal police departments are governed.
All week long, as protests and rioting continued, major cultural institutions and businesses in the city have sought to align themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement. A few days ago, the Laundress, a line of upscale detergents with a flagship store in SoHo, already ripped apart, sent out an email to “The Laundress Community,” articulating the responsibility it felt “to put an end to systematic racism.” The work was there to be done all along.

In Empty Theater Hoping Disney Advertisers Show Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: "We're a mess," the late-night host said at an online event meant to replace the annual celebrity-studded showcase hyping the Disney-owned networks ABC, ESPN and FX.
From a Lincoln Center stage, Jimmy Kimmel looked out at nearly 3,000 empty seats that, in any other year, would have been filled for the Walt Disney Company's annual presentation to advertisers.
"I forgot to delete this from my iCal," he said on video presented to the media giant's advertising clients.
In reality, the host of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on Disney's ABC network, was nowhere near the New York landmark, having filmed his segment in front of a green screen at home.
The computer-generated set was one of many concessions that networks have made as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the upfronts, a series of springtime events where advertisers attend canapé-and-cocktail parties and celebrity-studded showcases meant to hype the fall television season.
"You want shrimp? Next year we'll give you shrimp," Mr. Kimmel told the ad buyers watching him from home this year. "But in the meantime, we need cash."
The advertising industry is still feeling out how to do business in the pandemic. Major spenders such as Anheuser-Busch and L'Oreal scaled back marketing. Many others are shying away from long-term promises to buy commercial time and opting for deals made on short notice.
Flexibility has never been more important as companies scrambled to adjust their reactions to the news: first opting for caution during the pandemic and then, in recent days, pausing some ad campaigns out of sensitivity to the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.
With theaters closed in New York, media companies have resorted to less elaborate presentations to keep advertisers interested. Following events by NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS and other companies, Disney put on what it called a "virtual roadshow" made up of seven presentations, shown to ad agencies over the past two weeks, filled with sizzle reels backed by triumphant music.
Executives hyped upcoming shows from various Disney channels: an FX drama starring Jeff Bridges and Matthew McConaughey, a detective thriller on ABC from David E. Kelley, an ESPN documentary about Tom Brady. There were appearances by Alex Rodriguez, Gordon Ramsay, David Muir, Robin Roberts and Bear Grylls.
In a presentation shown to reporters, Jeff Meacham, an actor from ABC's "black-ish," had a conversation with a Barbie doll. Ryan Seacrest, who hosts "American Idol," called Disney a "reach machine" for its popularity with multiple generations. Kerry Washington, who stars in "Little Fires Everywhere" on Hulu, talked up product placement opportunities.
The topic of production delays laid bare the effect of the pandemic. The new season of the National Geographic show "Genius," featuring Cynthia Erivo as Aretha Franklin, halted filming with two episodes left. "Supermarket Sweep," an ABC game show hosted by Leslie Jones, was stalled just before filming was set to start. After the death of George Floyd, Disney added a note to the presentations expressing support for the black community, saying that the company was "struggling to make sense of all recent tragedies" and that it was "outraged by the killing of George Floyd among so many others."
TV viewership has surged during the pandemic, but companies have slashed budgets for commercials by more than 40 percent, according to the research firm Kantar. Ad spots, which had grown steadily more expensive in recent years, have sold for 20 percent or more below their usual rates, media buyers said.
Disney's ad revenue is expected to slump $ 1.4 billion this year and will not fully recover for another two years, according to a forecast from the research firm MoffettNathanson.
"Many advertisers are unable to commit to budgets, and many TV networks don't have finished product to sell," said Tim Nollen, an analyst with Macquarie Capital, in a note to investors last month.
Companies canceled between 15 and 20 percent of third quarter spending commitments with ABC, up from 5 to 10 percent normally, said Rita Ferro, Disney's ad sales chief, in an interview.
Networks hope that sales recover as golf and other sports return. To lure advertising dollars, networks are dangling flexible payment terms.
"People and brands are starting to feel a little more -- I'm not going to say 'comfortable' with the new normal, but understanding that they have to get back into the market," Ms. Ferro said.
Disney has a new chief executive, Bob Chapek, who replaced Robert A. Iger in February and then had to announce that Disney's profit fell more than 90 percent in its most recent quarter. The head of streaming, Kevin Mayer, left Disney last month to become the chief executive of TikTok.
The whiplash informed Mr. Kimmel's virtual monologue, which was dotted with fake applause.
"We are a mess," he said. "We don't know who our boss is."

Full text: Officers have charged and swung batons at demonstrators after curfew with seemingly little provocation. The mayor said he would review any reports of inappropriate enforcement.
It was about 45 minutes past New York City's 8 p.m. curfew on Wednesday when a peaceful protest march encountered a line of riot police near Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn.
Hundreds of demonstrators stopped and chanted for 10 minutes, arms raised, until their leaders decided to turn the group around and leave the area.
The protesters had not seen that riot police had flooded the plaza behind them, boxing them in. The maneuver was a law enforcement tactic called kettling. The police encircle protesters so that they have no way to exit from a park, city block or other public space, and then charge in and make arrests.
For the next 20 minutes in Downtown Brooklyn, officers swinging batons turned a demonstration that had been largely peaceful into a scene of chaos.
The kettling operations carried out by the police department after curfew have become among the most unsettling symbols of its use of force against peaceful protests, and have touched off a fierce backlash against Mayor Bill de Blasio and the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea.
In the past several days, New York Times journalists covering the protests have seen officers repeatedly charge at demonstrators after curfew with seemingly little provocation, shoving them onto sidewalks, striking them with batons and using other rough tactics.
The escalation in the use of force in New York is part of a national trend. Across the country, local police have resorted to increasingly violent crowd control techniques to control the protests ignited by the death George Floyd, a black man, as he was being held down by a white officer in Minneapolis.
In Minneapolis, the police have used tear gas, rubber bullets and projectiles to deter peaceful protesters and journalists. In Los Angeles, the police were recorded using batons to strike demonstrators, and in Philadelphia, police officers corralled and tear-gassed an entire crowd.
Two Buffalo officers were suspended after they were filmed by a local news outlet shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground. And in Atlanta, six police officers were charged after they were recorded pulling two college students out of their car, and using a stun gun on them.
Several incidents are under investigation in New York, too, the authorities said, including a moment when two police S.U.V.s drove forward into a crowd that had been blocking them, knocking several people to the ground.
The kettling strategy has been broadly defended by both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Shea, who said it was necessary escalation to deter looters who ransacked parts of Manhattan over the weekend. "There comes a point where enough is enough," Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday.
But there have been few reports of looting in the last three days of unrest, and the police are deploying their more aggressive tactics against protesters who have done little beyond continuing to march after the city's 8 p.m. curfew. About 270 people were arrested on Thursday night.
The police department's crackdown suffered a blow on Friday from the district attorneys in Manhattan and Brooklyn, who announced they would not prosecute anyone arrested during the protests on low-level charges.
The Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said he would not prosecute those charged with violating curfew or unlawful assembly, while Manhattan's prosecutor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said that "in the interest of justice" he would decline to pursue convictions for unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct.
"Our office has a moral imperative to enact public policies which assure all New Yorkers that in our justice system and our society, black lives matter and police violence is a crime," Mr. Vance said in a statement. Mr. Gonzalez's said, "We stand for the right of people to protest." Both said they would continue to prosecute people accused of violence against officers and of looting.
As images of police officers using force to arrest seemingly peaceful demonstrators have circulated online, Mr. de Blasio, who ran on a platform to reform the police, has come under sharp criticism from some elected officials, community leaders and even his former aides. He was jeered and booed at a memorial for Mr. Floyd on Thursday.
By Friday, after more than a week of protests, the mayor had softened his tone, pledging to review reports of police officers behaving inappropriately and promising he would announce disciplinary measures against some officers shortly.
Later, in an interview on WNYC, the public radio station, the mayor said that the encircling of protesters was sometimes necessary for public safety, and that the police were charging into crowds only when their commanders had evidence of imminent violence.
"I don't want to see protesters hemmed in if they don't need to be," he said, but he added "that sometimes there's a legitimate problem and it's not visible to protesters."
On Thursday, the police commissioner said he was reviewing at least seven videos that showed potential police misconduct and promised he would hold the officers accountable if the allegations were proven. On Friday night, he announced the suspension of two officers: one who violently pushed a woman to the ground, and another who pulled down a protester's face mask and then pepper sprayed him.
But Mr. Shea also stressed that some protesters had come to the demonstrations with the intent to attack the police. He also said the anti-police rhetoric of the demonstrators -- and some elected officials -- was encouraging attacks on officers, several of whom had been injured with sticks, or thrown bottles and bricks.
"We need healing," Mr. Shea said. "We need dialogue. We need peace."
For many protesters, however, the hard-nosed tactics the police have employed to shut down marches after curfew have only exacerbated the violence.
Axel Hernandez, 30, was protesting at Cadman Plaza on Wednesday night when officers rushed into the crowd. Mr. Hernandez, who had marched several times this week, said that up until that point it had been one of the calmest demonstrations he had attended.
"That was the most peaceful, no bottles thrown, no anything," he said. "The next thing I know, police rush in, with batons, and started moving people, and start hitting people."
Experts on crowd control say kettling is a technique the police have used for decades, not just in New York City, but around the world, including Northern Ireland. In theory, officers surround protesters, cutting off exits until they tire, then let them disperse in small groups.
But because demonstrators have nowhere to go, the maneuver often ends with a charge and mass arrests. Since the city put a curfew in place this week, the police have used the technique in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx.
"Kettling is basically when you take the crowd and drive it into a box, which is a great idea if you're wanting to capture people," said Dennis Kenney, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "It's generally a way to greatly increase the likelihood of conflict."
On Thursday night, in the Bronx, rows of officers surrounded protesters from all sides, pinning them in before running at them with batons and striking several people. At least one was taken away in a stretcher.
Asked about the incident on WNYC, Mr. de Blasio said the police believed some in the crowd had intended to be destructive.
"The groups organizing that event advertised their desire to do violence and create violence," Mr. de Blasio said.
"If any protesters were there peacefully and not associated with that, and they got hemmed in at all, that's something I don't accept that and we have to fix," Mr. de Blasio said, promising a full review of the incident.
Mr. Shea said Friday that police officers recovered gasoline and weapons, including a firearm, from the crowd.
Many demonstrators whom the police have trapped in kettle formations have had no way to disperse before being arrested, witnesses and protesters said. On Wednesday night, for instance, the police would not to let protesters encircled near Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence in Manhattan, comply with an order to leave.
"We were asking them, 'Where should we go?' Everyone's hands were in the air,"' one of the protesters, Lucas Zwirner, said. Many demonstrators told the police they would disperse and go home, Mr. Zwirner said, but officers would not let them through.
Police officers have used the maneuver to end some marches, but not others. At one demonstration n Brooklyn on Wednesday, the police waited until 9 p.m. -- an hour beyond the 8 p.m. curfew -- to surround protesters and charge.
The day before, they allowed thousands to march peacefully across the Manhattan Bridge hours after curfew had ended, and escorted a group of thousands back to Brooklyn before letting them disperse. It was a different story in the Bronx on Thursday, when officers surrounded a group of demonstrators and began making arrests just minutes after the 8 p.m. curfew.
"We are continuing to exercise discretion," Mr. Shea said Thursday evening. "Where we have made arrests, we have made them strategically."

Full text: A video showed the protester motionless on the ground and bleeding. Fifty-seven officers resigned from the department's Emergency Response Team in solidarity with the two who were suspended.
Prosecutors are investigating the actions of two Buffalo police officers who were suspended without pay on Thursday night after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester, who was hospitalized with a head injury.
The video taken by WBFO, a local radio station, shows the man, identified on Friday as Martin Gugino, approaching a group of officers during a protest stemming from the death of George Floyd. He was identified by the Western New York Peace Center, a nonprofit that named him in a Facebook post, saying he is a peace activist and a member.
After the video shows Mr. Gugino stopping in front of the officers to talk, an officer yells "push him back" three times; one officer pushes his arm into Mr. Gugino's chest, while another extends his baton toward him with both hands. Mr. Gugino flails backward, landing just out of range of the camera, with blood immediately leaking from his right ear.
An officer leans down to examine him, the video shows, but another officer then pulls the first officer away. Several other officers are seen walking by the man, motionless on the ground, without checking on him.
On Friday, John T. Evans, the president of the Buffalo police union, said all 57 officers on the Emergency Response Team, a special squad formed to respond to riots, had resigned from the team in support of the suspended officers, according to The Buffalo News. The officers remain employed by the department.
"These officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square," Mr. Evans told The News. "It doesn't specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40. They were simply doing their job. I don't know how much contact was made. He did slip, in my estimation. He fell backwards."
The Erie County District Attorney's Office said in a statement on Friday that prosecutors were investigating the incident. It said Mr. Gugino was unable to provide a statement to investigators on Thursday night at the Erie County Medical Center, where he was taken for treatment for the head injury. On Friday, Mr. Gugino was in serious but stable condition and was alert and oriented, according to a hospital spokesman.
The video, which rapidly spread across social media, added to a growing body of videos from across the nation that showed officers responding to protests against police violence with more police violence. Fury among online supporters of the protests was heightened by the Police Department's initial claim that he "tripped and fell," a description at direct odds with the video.
The officers' union and the Buffalo Police Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Friday. Byron Brown, the mayor of Buffalo, said the city was aware of the development.
"At this time, we can confirm that contingency plans are in place to maintain police services and ensure public safety within our community," he said. "The Buffalo police continue to actively work with the New York State Police and other cooperating agencies."
A lawyer for Mr. Gugino described him on Friday as a "longtime peaceful protester, human rights advocate and overall fan of the U.S. Constitution for many years."
"Mr. Gugino requests privacy for himself and his family as he recovers," the lawyer, Kelly V. Zarcone, said. "He appreciates all of the well-wishes he has received and requests that any further protests continue to be peaceful."
The Buffalo Police Department told local news media that five people were arrested during the protest.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York condemned the actions of the officers in the video late Thursday night.
"The incident in Buffalo is wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. "I've spoken with City of Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and we agree that the officers involved should be immediately suspended. Police officers must enforce -- not abuse -- the law."
"It sickens me," the Erie County executive, Mark Poloncarz, said on Twitter of the video, which includes both vulgarity and disturbing images.
Mr. Brown, the mayor, said in a statement that he was disturbed by the episode and that the city's police commissioner had ordered an immediate investigation.
"After days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, police leadership and members of the community, tonight's event is disheartening," he said.
Like other cities in New York, Buffalo has widely deployed law enforcement during the protests. On June 1, officers in armored vehicles fired tear gas after asking a crowd to disperse. Several stores were looted; a vehicle drove into a group of police officers, injuring two; and two people were struck by gunfire.
The next day, Mr. Poloncarz said he was imposing a curfew because of those events, when a "peaceful protest devolved into violence."
In response, the New York Civil Liberties Union raised concerns that the curfew would be disproportionately enforced against nonwhite residents of the state. On Thursday, John Curr, the director of its Buffalo chapter, referred to the treatment of Mr. Gugino, saying the "casual cruelty" of the officers was "gut-wrenching and unacceptable."
"Suspensions and an investigation are already in order, but there is little more we have to see to know what took place," Mr. Curr said in a statement. "Police officers cannot continue to hide behind the lie that they are protecting and serving."
Mr. Curr said city leaders "need to take this as a wake-up call and seriously address the police violence during this week's protest and the culture of impunity that led to this incident."
The Buffalo Police Department has been accused in lawsuits in recent years of discriminating against minority groups. In 2018, the department was sued in federal court, accused of discriminating against people of color through traffic enforcement practices that included checkpoints in neighborhoods where a majority of residents are black.
Chinyere Ezie, one of the lawyers litigating the case, said additional plaintiffs had been added to the suit, amended in April. Ms. Ezie said the video showing Mr. Gugino's treatment highlighted "systemic problems and institutional failures" in the department's enforcement, even when both the city's mayor and police chief are black.
"It is a lens applied as to who and what is criminal," she said. "We are seeing a pandemic of police brutality in a racial justice lens."

Cities Ask if It’s Time to Defund Police and ‘Reimagine’ Public Safety [With graphic(s)]

Full text: Enlarge this image.
After more than a week of protests against police brutality and unrest that left parts of the city burned, a growing chorus of elected officials, civic leaders and residents in Minneapolis are urging the city to break up the Police Department and reimagine the way policing works.
“We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department,” Jeremiah Ellison, a member of the City Council, said on Twitter this week. “And when we’re done, we’re not simply gonna glue it back together,” he added. “We are going to dramatically rethink how we approach public safety and emergency response.”
At least three others, including the City Council president, Lisa Bender, have also called for taking the Police Department apart.
Minneapolis is not the only city asking the question. Across the country, calls to defund, downsize or abolish police departments are gaining new traction after national unrest following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes on a busy Minneapolis street.
On Wednesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles announced that he would cut as much as $150 million from a planned increase in the Police Department’s budget. And in New York, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Daniel Dromm, a council member from Queens, vowed even before the latest protests to cut the Police Department’s $6 billion budget, which they noted had been left almost untouched even as education and youth programs faced steep cuts.
The calls to redirect money away from the police come as cities face steep budget shortfalls because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus, and as public anger against police brutality has roiled the country. Redirecting funding is one of the few levers that elected officials have over the police, who are frequently shielded by powerful unions and labor arbitrators who reinstate officers fired for misconduct.
Dromm, chair of the city’s finance committee, said that in order to restore some funding to youth programs he was considering a delay in the next class of police cadets and scrutinizing the $700 million in police overtime that has been budgeted for this year. He said the events of recent days — including police officers’ treatment of peaceful protesters — had shown that years of efforts to reform the department had not succeeded.
“The culture in the New York City Police Department has not changed,” he said. “The white shirts, the commanding officers, they kind of get it and talk the talk, but the average beat cop doesn’t believe in it and we’ve seen this over and over again.”
In Minneapolis, calls to dismantle the police are likely to further demoralize a force that already is reeling from the killing of Floyd, the criminal charges filed against four former officers, looting in the city and the burning of a police precinct.
“That’s not the answer,” said Gwen Gunter, a retired lieutenant of the Minneapolis Police Department who is also a member of a black police officers association.
“There’s a part of me that hopes they do succeed,” she said, “because I want to see how long it takes before they say, ‘Oh, no we do need a Police Department.’”
The Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, pledged Friday to “continue to work on efforts to improve public trust, public safety and transformational culture change of the MPD.” His statement did not address the recent calls to dismantle the department.
Those who support the movement to scale back the responsibilities of the police say officers frequently abuse their power and instigate violence rather than prevent it. They say many social welfare tasks that currently fall to armed police officers — responding to drug overdoses and working with people who have a mental illness or are homeless — would be better carried out by nurses or social workers.
One model that members of the Minneapolis City Council cite is Cahoots, a nonprofit mobile crisis intervention program that has handled mental health calls in Eugene, Oregon, since 1989. Cahoots employees responded to more than 24,000 calls for service last year — about 20% of the area’s 911 calls — on a budget of about $2 million, probably far less than what it would have cost the Police Department to do the work, said Tim Black, the program’s operations coordinator.
“There’s a strong argument to be made from a fiscally conservative perspective,” Black said. “Public safety institutions generally have these massive budgets and there’s questions about what they are doing.”
But handing over one aspect of police work is not a panacea. Eugene has had at least two officers shoot people in the past year.
Last year, after a campaign by a group called Durham Beyond Policing, the City Council in Durham, North Carolina, voted against hiring 18 new police officers and began discussing a “community safety and wellness task force” instead.
Minneapolis took a step in that direction last year when it redirected funding for eight new police officers into a new office for violence prevention.
“We have an opportunity to reimagine what the future of public safety looks like,” said Steve Fletcher, a City Council member who pushed that effort. But he acknowledged that the effort to build a viable alternative to the police on social and mental health issues would take years and that no one could be sure what it would look like in the end.
“It’s very easy as an activist to call for the abolishment of the police,” said Fletcher, himself a former activist who protested a 2015 police shooting. “It is a heavier decision when you realize that it’s your constituents that are going to be the victims of crime you can’t respond to if you dismantle that without an alternative.”
Black activists in the city have been calling for the police to be dismantled for years, issuing a report in 2018 that argued that the oppression of poor people and black people was baked into the very founding of the department in 1867. Police reform has roiled politics in the city for years, and politicians who have been seen as slow to reform have been defeated. But only recently have calls to dismantle the police been widely embraced by white leaders in the city.
In Linden Hills, a predominantly white Minneapolis neighborhood near a golf course and two lakes that has not seen very many of the overly aggressive police tactics that the city’s black residents complain about, residents acknowledge that the department needs to be significantly reformed. But they have been leery of pledges to abolish the police.
“What does that even mean?” asked Steve Birch, the chair of the Linden Hills Neighborhood Council. “Then who provides the public service of policing? I don’t even know how to answer that.”
But in Kingfield, a neighborhood in South Minneapolis not far from where Floyd died, Chris DesRoches, the president of the neighborhood association, said he supported defunding the department.
“The killing of George Floyd has opened the eyes of people to the worst case scenario of police,” he said, adding that the case has created an opportunity “for white people to start hearing what communities of color and community leaders have been saying all along, which is that the police are an organization which has been actively harmful to our communities.”
Mayor Jacob Frey has said he does not support calls to dismantle the department. On Friday, City Council members voted to accept a civil rights investigation by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to adopt updates to the Police Department’s use of force policy that include a ban on chokeholds. The topic of eliminating some of the department’s functions was not discussed.
Still, council members acknowledged during their debate that something had changed fundamentally in the way that city residents view the police. The University of Minnesota, as well as the school board and the parks department in Minneapolis, decided in recent days to cut ties with the Police Department.
Many in Minneapolis have said that Floyd’s death provided a stark illustration of how far efforts to institute reforms in the wake of the 2015 police shooting of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old African American man, had fallen short.
After that shooting, police officers received implicit bias training and body cameras. The department appointed its first black police chief. Community policing was emphasized. Policies were rewritten to include a “duty to intervene” if an officer saw a colleague endangering a member of the public — a policy that was key to the swift firing and arrest of the four officers involved in Floyd’s death.
But those reforms were not sufficient to prevent Floyd’s death.
“The fact that none of the officers took the initiative to follow the policy to intervene, it just became really clear to me that this system wasn’t going to work, no matter how much we threw at it,” said Alondra Cano, who heads the City Council’s public safety committee.
Cano, who says she was part of a “prosecute the police” campaign while she was a college student, acknowledged that it might take years to build viable alternatives. But she said many city residents, some of whom have formed mutual protection neighborhood groups in the wake of the unrest, were ready to try.
“There’s a moment of deep commitment that I’ve never seen before, and that gives me leave as an elected official to start experimenting with other systems,” she said.

Their faces are painted on the walls so that people will not forget.
In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, grocery shoppers at the Triple S Food Mart walk by an image of Alton Sterling near the spot where the 37-year-old black man was fatally shot by two police officers in 2016.
In the Bronx, New York, a portrait of Amadou Diallo adorns a building on Wheeler Avenue close to where he was killed in a hail of 41 police bullets in 1999.
But the murals that memorialize people killed in deadly encounters with police do not always survive as legacies of loss.
So it is with the mural that was painted on a Staten Island, New York, storefront in 2018 to mark the death of Eric Garner, who suffocated in a police officer’s chokehold in 2014. This week, when protesters decrying the death of George Floyd in Minnesota marched on Staten Island, they passed the spot on Bay Street where Garner had died, but the mural has been painted over.
In Minneapolis last week, Cadex Herrera, Greta McLain and Xena Goldman created a mural of Floyd near the site of his fatal encounter with police. Now Herrera and Goldman are working on another one down the block.
“I hope that no one desecrates it,” Herrera said. “If they do, we will paint again.”
The portrait features Floyd’s likeness crowned by a flaming sunflower that contains the names of others who have died in custody or in encounters with police. The mural, and more significantly the outrage associated with Floyd’s death at the hands of a police officer now charged with murder, have inspired similar images of him everywhere from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Idlib, Syria.
“We needed to see his face,” Herrera said. “We needed to show that he was a human being.”
When they are first painted, murals can act as ad hoc altars for public mourning. But their existence is often fleeting. A mural of Philando Castile, who was killed in 2016 during a traffic stop by a Minnesota police officer, was destroyed when the building was demolished later that year. The officer was acquitted of manslaughter at trial in 2017.
In making his 2001 mural of Diallo in the Bronx, Hulbert Waldroup dressed the officers who shot Diallo in the white hoods of the Ku Klux Klan, a depiction that upset police officials. The mural was later vandalized with black paint, but the image was restored by Waldroup.
The mural was ultimately repainted by Hawa Diallo, no relation, in 2017 with Waldroup’s permission after years of deterioration. The new version, requested by the community, eliminated some of the painting’s controversial elements. The police officers, who were criminally charged in Diallo’s death but acquitted, are no longer shown. The current version emphasizes Diallo’s West African roots.
“Everyone may not have my views,” Waldroup said in an interview. “When you put something on a wall, you know it’s temporary. I’m now OK with the mural changing.”
Diallo’s mother, Kadiatou Diallo, was present at the unveiling of the redone mural in 2017.
“Time passes by, but for those who love, time will never pass,” she told reporters. “We will never forget what happened that night.”
In Trenton, New Jersey, a 2014 mural marking the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old student who was fatally shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, was removed soon after it was created.
The mural on a vacant storefront gate was sandblasted after some police officials said they worried it could damage community relations. The artist, Will Condry, protested the city’s decision and eventually met with the mayor and chief of police alongside representatives from the NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union, who joined in arguing that his portrait of Brown, dressed in his high school graduation cap, should be restored.
“I had a seat at the table, and I thought progress was being made, but once the attention died down they pushed me out,” said Condry. “I was disappointed.”
Federal and state officials in Missouri declined to prosecute the officer who shot Brown, and the officer later resigned from the force.
“Artists have a responsibility to promote the truth,” Condry said. “When you see an image of someone who was murdered by police, that’s going to speak to you.”
There had been tension, too, in Louisiana, where Jo Hines created the mural of Sterling in 2016. A federal investigation declined to bring charges against the officers, one of whom was later fired for having violated the Baton Rouge Police Department’s use-of-force policies during the incident.
The Sterling mural has evolved over the years, gathering messages of prayer from people. Some have added images of balloons and teddy bears, small updates that allow the mural to function as a living memorial.
But Hines also remembers how tense things were when he first made the mural. “Depending on what I painted, the attitudes of people would change. If I painted something angry, there could have been violence,” he recalled. “But I saw women and children walking by and decided that I would do something for Alton’s family.
“It’s about honoring Alton,” Hines said. “We know what happened to him, but allowing that person who was done wrong to live forever through a mural is a more powerful message.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday laced into President Donald Trump’s stewardship of the economy, arguing that even as a new jobs report showed moderate and unexpected gains, Trump should be held to account for deepening the nation’s staggering and unequal economic pain.
Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, delivered the speech at Delaware State University, a historically black university in Dover, Delaware, just hours after a jobs report showed the unemployment rate falling to 13.3% from 14.7% in April as employers added some 2.5 million jobs, to the surprise of many economists. Republicans hope to run on a message of economic comeback after months of devastating numbers amid the pandemic, and Biden, too, said that he was “proud of” and “so happy” for the Americans who had found work.
But it was far too soon, he warned, to declare the economic crisis over, noting that black unemployment had risen and millions of Americans continued to face extraordinary financial difficulties — circumstances that could have been mitigated, he said, had Trump responded more quickly to the coronavirus crisis.
It was Biden’s latest effort to center the race around familiar themes of leadership and steadiness, as well as to press populist language he has increasingly embraced in recent months as the nation’s economic footing has crumbled.
“It’s time for him to step out of his own bunker,” Biden said of the president, suggesting that Trump was prematurely seeking to declare “Mission Accomplished.” “A president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of Americans their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.”
Biden’s remarks came as the country also reeled from unrest surrounding issues of race and police violence, following the killing in Minneapolis last week of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck.
As Trump touted the economic news Friday, he also referenced Floyd, saying, “Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that’s happening for our country.”
This is “a great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody,” the president continued.
Biden called those remarks “despicable.”
He also noted that Trump’s comments about Floyd came as the economic picture continued to look grim, especially for African Americans.
Joblessness for black workers rose slightly in Friday’s report, to 16.8% from 16.7%, and unemployment for Asian Americans increased to 15% from 14.5%. The unemployment rate for white workers fell from 14.2% to 12.4%, while joblessness for Hispanic workers declined from 18.9% to 17.6% (Biden said in his remarks that Hispanic unemployment had risen; a spokesman later said he was referring to Latino youth in particular).
And the full scope of the economic downturn remains catastrophic, even after Friday’s numbers. The U.S. economy lost more than 20.5 million jobs in April, according to Labor Department numbers, the largest decline since the government began tracking the data in the 1930s.
“The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God,” Biden said, “but to a failure of a president.”
Biden charged that Trump’s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis had needlessly cost both American lives and jobs.
On Friday, by contrast, Trump sought to claim credit for steering America through a crisis he asserts is receding, with his campaign declaring in a statement, “the great American comeback is underway.” The statement said “the economy roared back” and it “was thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the solid foundation his policies have laid.”
“Sadly, Democrat leaders in blue states have kept the economy from reopening for all Americans, preventing everyone from sharing in the economic rebirth as the people most heavily impacted by COVID are not yet seeing improvement,” it read. “Incredibly, Joe Biden is counting on more economic pain for Americans so he can capitalize on it politically.”
In fact, Biden has repeatedly lamented the economic toll, and did so again Friday.
Throughout his brief remarks, which lasted just over 12 minutes, Biden also sought to cast himself as a champion of the middle class running against a candidate concerned only about the wealthiest Americans.
And he previewed the sweeping economic proposals he plans to release to address public health and economic crises as well as a “crisis of inequity and indignity being endured by African Americans and many other people of color.” He noted that “those three challenges alone are deeply connected to one another, so the solutions have to be connected as well.”
The goal, he said, was “not just to build back the economy the way it was before COVID-19, but to build it back better” — a message that reflected the hope of many progressives who want to see Biden, a moderate former senator, pursue more systemic change.
Echoing a theme he emphasized in a speech earlier this week, he cast the stakes of the election as far greater than those of a typical partisan political contest.
“Every American has a choice to make in November,” he said. “Not simply who they’re going to have as their president or senators or congresspeople. But what kind of country do we want to be? What kind of economy do we want, and who will it serve?”

Maybe it was something in Odessa McAtee’s dressing that led her son to a career in cooking.
“He loved my dressing,” she said, speaking over the phone Thursday from her home in Louisville, Kentucky. “‘Mama, make me some dressing,’” she recalled his asking all the time.
Her turkey dressing and collard greens were his favorites. “My collard greens? I pick them, I wash them, and I make sure that they are good and clean,” she said. “When I put them in the pot, I put my ham hock and my country ham and some red dry pepper and some regular salt.”
And the turkey dressing? “My dressing is really a secret recipe.”
Taking lessons learned in part from his mother’s kitchen, David McAtee went on to become a beloved fixture on the corner of 26th Street and Broadway in the predominantly black West End neighborhood of Louisville. There, his simple takeout restaurant, YaYa’s BBQ, was a rare source of good food in an area with few businesses of any kind.
McAtee, 53, the youngest of nine children raised by Odessa and James McAtee, died early Monday morning on that corner. He had been shot once in the chest amid a volley of bullets fired by two police officers and two National Guard members enforcing the city’s curfew on a group of people who were mingling and having a good time.
Federal and state officials are still investigating the shooting. The Louisville Metro Police Department released a video Tuesday that it said shows McAtee firing a gun at law enforcement officers. An analysis of that video and others by The New York Times suggests that McAtee did shoot. It also shows that police first fired pepper balls toward McAtee and his relatives, almost hitting his niece.
The notion that McAtee, who adopted the name YaYa after he became a Rastafarian a decade ago, would have fired on police officers is very much at odds with the man his mother and others remember.
“He fed them police, I know that for myself. Gave them food, didn’t charge them nothing,” recalled his mother, who sometimes helped out at the restaurant. “He fed a whole lot more people. Homeless people. He fed them. Why? That’s the way I raised him. To be nice to people. Treat people right.”
David James, president of the Louisville Metro Council, said McAtee’s generosity was well known.
“Say a meal cost $10, and someone said, ‘Hey I lost my job. I only have $5.’ Instead of him saying, ‘Give me $5,’ he would say, ‘You’re going to need that $5,’ and he’d give them the meal,” said James, a 30-year-veteran of the Louisville police force and one of McAtee’s customers.
Shannon Drew went to high school in the West End and remembers McAtee from her student days in the mid-1990s, when he sold barbecue on a neighborhood corner. By the time she saw him again, in 2016, she was the mother of two young sons, staying at a Volunteers of America shelter where McAtee was a chef from 2013 to 2016.
Drew had endured a run of misfortune: After a knee injury left her unable to work her day-care job, she was fired. Unemployment and medical bills left her behind on rent, and she was evicted Christmas Eve 2015.
At the shelter, she saw McAtee every day as he served food. “He encouraged me,” she recalled. “He would tell me, ‘You’re doing the best you can. You’re taking care of your sons; don’t be ashamed.’”
His words of encouragement were important to her sons as well. While she is white, her sons, Jaden and Darius, are biracial. McAtee, she said, was an especially good role model for them.
Last year, she saw McAtee for the last time. She was working at the Department of Motor Vehicles, and he came in to renew his license. “I’m sure with his business, he sees hundreds and hundreds of people,” she said. “Before I said anything, he knew me right away. He asked how my sons were doing.”
McAtee’s death has been particularly hard for a community that was already protesting the killing of Breonna Taylor, a black emergency medical technician, in her home by white police officers in March.
Louisville, according to political and civic leaders, has never fully recovered from government practices that have crippled black economic development and progress in the city for generations.
In 1917, in Buchanan v. Warley, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a city law prohibiting the sale of property to African Americans in predominantly white neighborhoods. But since the policy applied only to laws and not private agreements, white residents began to use racially restrictive private covenants to keep black residents from investing or living in neighborhoods that were mostly white.
The federal government’s “urban renewal” efforts of the 1950s and 1960s further damaged the fabric of black neighborhoods in the name of redevelopment.
As for McAtee’s neighborhood, “a concerted effort through city ordinances and policies of redlining effectively cut the west Louisville neighborhoods off and led to disinvestment and neglect of the West End for many years,” said Cheri Bryant Hamilton, a 19-year veteran of the Louisville Metro Council.
As a result of these and other policies, the West End lacked many of the amenities Americans generally associate with urban living.
“The West End is a food desert, or food apartheid area,” said Hannah Drake, a poet and activist, who said McAtee’s restaurant filled a void. “There are not that many places to eat in the West End. Kids could get food from him after school. Now there is a hole in that community.”
Hundreds of people stood near McAtee’s restaurant for hours after his death, Drake said. For nearly 14 hours, his body remained there while police investigated, said Sadiqa Reynolds, a former deputy mayor and current president of the Louisville Urban League.
“You know how it is to be in community with people who absolutely adored this man, standing across the street from the place they know his body is, and having police on the other side of the street guarding him, and understanding that it was police who took his life?” Reynolds said.
After McAtee’s body was removed and police left, Reynolds sensed a need for closure. She called on Pat Mathison, a gospel singer whose a cappella rendition of “Amazing Grace” at the scene lent a modicum of dignity to the moment.
When police finally cleared the scene, there was cheering but also rage, Reynolds said. At that point, she said, “there were a million ways this thing could have gone wrong.”
Something else did go wrong in the neighborhood, early Tuesday morning. Looters broke into a Kroger supermarket and left with shopping carts full of goods. The store was one of the few places in the area where people could buy fresh food or have prescriptions filled.
“After they trashed the Kroger, people in the community came out at 4 a.m., of their own volition, and started cleaning it up,” said Gerald Neal, a state senator who represents western Louisville.
Odessa McAtee, whose youngest daughter also died this year after battling health problems, said the family had not finalized plans for the future of YaYa’s BBQ. But Marvin McAtee said he would keep operating the business.
“Hopefully the business will continue on,” said Glenn Browder, a cousin of David McAtee’s who lives in Santa Ana, California. “David’s brother has sons, and they helped out there. It’s important to the family and important to the city as well.”

Last week, Andrea Ritchie, a researcher at Barnard Center for Research on Women, joined thousands of others across the U.S. to take part in a protest demanding justice for George Floyd. She proudly chanted his name outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.
“But I was shocked that I didn’t hear anyone say Breonna Taylor’s name at any point,” Ritchie said, referring to the black emergency medical technician in Louisville, Kentucky, who was killed by police in March, just weeks before Floyd’s death. Officers burst into Taylor’s apartment while she was asleep during a late-night drug investigation using a so-called “no-knock warrant.” Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who has said he was worried someone was breaking into the apartment, shot and wounded an officer. The officers have said that they then returned fire and shot Taylor at least eight times in her own home.
Her mother filed a lawsuit against the Louisville Metro Police Department in late April, and people in Louisville started taking to the streets demanding justice in May. None of the officers in her case have been arrested or fired, though the FBI is currently investigating the case.
In an effort to resurface Taylor’s story on social media, users started using the hashtag #SayHerName last week.
But even that, Ritchie noted, has been turned into #SayHisName.
“ All black lives matter,” she said, adding that this movement should be striving to address police brutality against black men and women and LGBTQ people, who also face violence by law enforcement.
“We’re not trying to compete with Floyd’s story; we’re trying to complete the story,” said Ritchie, who is also the author of “Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women and Women of Color.”
Sen. Kamala Harris echoed that sentiment on Thursday. “We can’t forget about black women in our quest for justice,” she wrote on Twitter.
Things started to shift Friday, on what would have been Taylor’s 27th birthday. Protesters marched in her honor. Some sang Happy Birthday; others released balloons and sent birthday cards to Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, demanding justice. The hashtag #BirthdayForBreonna was used widely on social media.
Still, Taylor’s case remains largely disconnected with the broader national conversation that’s happening around George Floyd — no celebrities have offered to pay for her funeral or taken out full-page ads in newspapers across the country dedicated to her, and few brands have started campaigns in her name.
Perhaps it’s because there was no graphic video footage of the scene or because it all happened back in March at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But her exclusion, and that of other black women, is the latest iteration of a long-standing issue: Black women’s experiences of police brutality and their tireless contributions to mass social justice movements have almost always been left out of the picture, receiving far less media or political attention.
For years, black women have faced a double bind of racial and gender discrimination.
According to a 2017 report by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, black women remain underrepresented in the political system; black women are more likely to work jobs that lack crucial benefits and protections; more black women live in poverty than any other group; black women experience higher rates of intimate partner violence; and the gender barriers in access to health care are higher for black women than white women.
The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened all of those fissures. The unemployment rate for black women is now 16.4% compared with 15.5% for women overall, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving them in increasingly precarious positions.
When it comes to interactions with police, the same racial biases that apply to black men apply to black women too, Ritchie said. Black women are more likely than white women to be pulled over in traffic stops, according to data from the Prison Policy Initiative. They are also more likely than white women to be incarcerated and currently make up the largest portion of women in local jails compared with other women of color. Black women also face brutal police violence, which frequently takes the form of sexual assault or harassment at the hands of officers, away from cameras and the public eye, Ritchie said. And, she added, alarmingly, it often occurs when officers are responding to calls for help from domestic violence or sexual assault.
It is in large part because of these layers of inequalities that black women have risen up to form the backbone of some of the largest civil rights movements in U.S. history — from abolition and suffrage to #MeToo.
“Some of our loudest voices against oppression have come from black women,” said Monique Morris, founder and board chair of the National Black Women’s Justice Institute. Young black girls, too, have been a big part of “the articulation of our democracy” — like 15-year-old Claudette Colvin, who refused to give up her seat on a bus months before Rosa Parks did the same. In fact, it was 17-year-old Darnella Frazier who filmed Floyd’s killing in a video that has since sparked protests across the country.
The Black Lives Matter movement was also founded by three women — Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi — who were angered by the acquittal in 2013 of George Zimmerman, the man who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
“We did want to start a movement,” Cullors said. “Did we know we were going to be successful? No. But we worked hard, for years, making sure that people saw what was happening and how it was happening.”
Yet, movements tend to latch on to a singular ‘face’ or leader and, for many, that ideal image is predominantly still a straight man, Cullors said.
“It’s easier to be seduced by masculinity and the idea that we’re going to be saved by a black Christian male,” Cullors said, noting the appeal around Martin Luther King as an example. “That’s a problem. We don’t fully understand how racism and sexism and patriarchy and homophobia impact our community.”
Without that understanding, any proposed changes in police conduct or laws will be limited in scope, and women’s concerns will continue to be overlooked, Ritchie said. For example, there currently isn’t any official data collection on police sexual misconduct, nationally or at the local level, Ritchie added, and changing that should be a part of the broader police reforms.
America needs an intersectional lens over what all black communities are experiencing and the strategies to address them, Morris said.
“We need to understand justice to be expansive,” she said.

TACOMA, Wash. — A woman who witnessed the arrest of Manuel Ellis, a black man who died during the police encounter in Tacoma, has come forward to dispute the account provided by police, saying officers themselves had initiated a confrontation so violent that she yelled at them to “stop hitting him.”
Sara McDowell, who was in a car behind the officers, said Friday in an interview that she saw Ellis approach the police car late on the night of March 3 for what she initially thought was a friendly conversation. But that suddenly changed, she said, when an officer threw open the car door and knocked Ellis to the ground.
Police have provided a different account, saying that Ellis initiated the confrontation when he picked up a police officer and threw him to the ground, prompting officers to move in to restrain him.
McDowell, who recorded parts of the encounter on video, said that the violence of the police response had appeared to her to be unprovoked.
In brief video clips captured by McDowell, officers can be seen punching Ellis, 33, while he was on the ground. On one of the video clips, her voice can be heard calling out to them: “Stop. Oh, my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.”
“I was terrified for his life, honestly,” McDowell said. “The way that they attacked him didn’t make sense to me. I went home and was sick to my stomach.”
Ellis died in the minutes following his arrest after pleading, “I can’t breathe” — an eerie echo of some of the final words from other black men who have died in police custody, including Eric Garner and George Floyd.
McDowell said she did not realize until this week that Ellis had died in the aftermath of what she saw.
The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, which has been investigating the death, had no immediate comment on McDowell’s account or on the two videos she posted of the arrest.
The county medical examiner’s office reported this week that Ellis died from respiratory arrest, hypoxia and physical restraint and categorized the death as a homicide. The report listed methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease as contributing factors.
After McDowell’s videos were posted online Thursday, Tacoma’s mayor, Victoria Woodards, released a video message late Thursday night saying she was enraged by what she saw and was directing the city manager to fire all of the officers involved.
“The officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Woodards said.
While the videos show only two officers arresting Ellis, the Tacoma Police Department has identified four officers involved in the arrest: Christopher Burbank, 34; Matthew Collins, 37; Masyih Ford, 28; and Timothy Rankine, 31. Two of the officers are white, while one is black and one is Asian, according to the Police Department.
After the death, the officers had been placed on leave but then returned to work because no policy violations were found. They were placed on leave again this week.
On the night of his death, Ellis had been jubilant after playing drums at a church service, family and friends said. Marcia Carter, his mother, said he called her late that night as he returned home and told her that he was feeling good.
“I’m just coming from church, Mom, feeling real good,” Carter recalled him saying. “I’m ready to give my life to Christ. I want to live it right. I want to raise my kids. I want to be around in their lives. I want to do the right thing.”
Family members said he later went out to get a snack from a convenience store.
Detective Ed Troyer of the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department said earlier that before the arrest, Ellis was bothering people in vehicles, approached the officers and then violently attacked one of them when they stepped out of the vehicle, throwing one officer to the ground.
The first video captured by McDowell begins in the middle of the encounter, showing two officers taking Ellis to the ground on the road in front of some garbage cans. With Ellis on his back, one of the officers got down on his knees and began punching Ellis.
In a later clip, as McDowell drove past the scene, video showed the officers asking Ellis to put his hands behind his back. The officers appeared to have Ellis subdued and on his side.
Troyer said earlier this week that Ellis at one point called out, “I can’t breathe,” and the officers called for medical support and propped Ellis on his side. He has said that Ellis was breathing when medics arrived but that though personnel worked on him for more than half an hour, he did not survive.
The officers were not wearing body cameras, and Woodards said Thursday that she would push to get funding for body cameras.

It is a simple gesture, swaddled in outrage and long-endured grief, that gained powerful currency through the protest against police brutality and racial injustice led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick on the fields of the National Football League.
Taking a knee.
Across the nation these last hard, uncertain days, demonstrators have turned to the gesture on city streets. At a nighttime march in Minneapolis on Wednesday, a crowd of 400 knelt for nearly five somber minutes. On the same day, George Floyd’s son, Quincy Mason, walked through a crowd at the site where a white police officer had pinned his father to the ground by a knee to the neck. There, before a makeshift memorial, Mason dropped to a knee.
The gesture has even been made sporadically by law enforcement officers, members of the National Guard and by prominent politicians as an act of solidarity or effort to pacify.
In New York, an NYPD commander knelt with activists outside Washington Square Park. In Portland, Oregon, police in riot gear knelt before cheering demonstrators, some of whom responded by walking toward the officers to shake their hands. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles walked amid a demonstration and knelt. And the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, took a knee at a campaign visit to a black church in Delaware.
Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since Jan. 1, 2017, his career cut short when no team would sign him following a season of player protest he led with the help of a teammate, Eric Reid.
But his kneeling objection during the playing of the national anthem has boomeranged through the choppy slipstream of the American consciousness and is again at the center of a turbulent moment with newfound force and, for the NFL, renewed debate.
“It’s a powerful, peaceful way to say you’re not OK with what’s been happening,” said Hibes Galeano, 32, a Latina who attended a protest in Minneapolis this week.
Others who knelt spoke of Kaepernick with reverence. “He did what a lot of other athletes wouldn’t have done,” said Dorien Harris, a black 19-year-old marcher who wore a face mask inscribed with the words “I Can’t Breathe” as he knelt.
“It took a lot of guts for him to do that, a lot of heart,” he added. “He knows what the community needs. It needs that strength. He was saying to stand up for what you believe in, no matter your position.”
While some demonstrators say they have had Kaepernick and his campaign in mind when kneeling, the gesture is also — intended or not — an echo to the manner of Floyd’s death.
“Kneeling is both an act of defiance and resistance but also of reverence, of mourning, but also honoring lives lost,” said Chad Williams, chairman of the department of African and Afro-American studies at Brandeis University. “It is also simple and clear. Its simplicity gave it symbolic power, and as we see now, its power persists.”
So does the controversy surrounding it.
Starting in 2016, despite Kaepernick’s explanation that his kneeling during the national anthem was a call to end racial injustice and police brutality toward people of color, a backlash fomented, spurred largely by President Donald Trump, who tried to recast Kaepernick and the predominantly African American group of players who followed his lead as unpatriotic. That viewpoint persists, expressed this week by New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who publicly apologized after saying in an interview that he views taking a knee during the anthem as an insult to the country.
“I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country,” Brees said, linking such defiance to condemnation of the military.
Taking a knee might be a simple gesture, but the fraught, contentious opinions about it are a mirror into the complexity of race in America.
Consider its NFL origin story.
Kaepernick and Reid came up with the idea after consulting a former Green Beret, Nate Boyer, who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan before playing college football at Texas and then getting a tryout with the Seattle Seahawks. “Colin straight-up asked me what I thought he should do,” said Boyer, speaking recently over the phone from Oregon.
Boyer said he did some research and came across a photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. kneeling in prayer and protest in Selma, Alabama, during the 1960s. Boyer also remembered taking a knee at Arlington National Cemetery, in reverence of fallen friends.
“If you’re not going to stand,” Boyer told Kaepernick and Reid as they sat in a hotel lobby hours before the 49ers’ final preseason game, against the San Diego Chargers, “I’d say your only other option is to take a knee.”
Boyer said he would never do such a thing during the anthem. But he had fought for the right of free expression, and though he said he was apolitical, he empathized with the drive to end racism and police brutality.
At the game that evening, he stood next to Kaepernick as he knelt and felt the sting of an angry, booing crowd rain onto the field. “Maybe that was my little taste of what it is like to be black. It helped me understand,” he said.
The players’ kneeling reached a peak in the 2017 season — when Trump demanded that team owners “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now!” for kneeling — but has since petered out.
In early 2019, the NFL handed over a payout believed to be roughly $6 million to settle a legal fight with Kaepernick and Reid, who argued they had been denied jobs because of their actions during the national anthem.
The league agreed to donate millions of dollars to community groups and causes chosen by players. It joined with Jay-Z, the hip-hop empresario, to consult on entertainment and contribute to the league’s activism campaign, Inspire Change. It also updated a policy, so far not enforced, requiring players to stand for the national anthem or remain in the locker room while it is played.
Within a week of Floyd’s death, kneeling became a common gesture. And its complexity carries on.
The way it has been adopted by members of law enforcement and politicians, for example, is best viewed with an eye that is both skeptical and hopeful, said Mark Anthony Neal, chairman of the African and African-American studies department at Duke.
“It’s an important gesture showing maybe they get it now,” he said. “But if those same officers and politicians are not willing to hold their own accountable going forward or look at their own actions and examine them closely, this is at best empty rhetoric.”
Kaepernick has remained publicly silent aside from recent postings about the protest on social media.
His latest on Twitter? A sarcastic retweet of Brees that shows a 2017 photo of the Saints quarterback taking a knee.

NEW YORK — It was about 8:45 p.m. in Brooklyn on Wednesday, 45 minutes past the city’s curfew, when a peaceful protest march encountered a line of riot police, near Cadman Plaza.
Hundreds of demonstrators stood there for 10 minutes, chanting, arms raised, until their leaders decided to turn the group around and leave the area.
What they had not seen was that riot police had flooded the plaza behind them, engaging in a law enforcement tactic called kettling, which involves encircling protesters so that they have no way to exit from a park, city block or other public space, and then charging them and making arrests.
For the next 20 minutes in downtown Brooklyn, officers swinging batons turned a demonstration that had been largely peaceful into a scene of chaos.
The kettling operations carried out by the city’s police after curfew on recent nights have become among the most unsettling symbols of the department’s use of force against peaceful protests, which has touched off a fierce backlash against Mayor Bill de Blasio and the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea.
In the past several days, New York Times journalists covering the protests have seen officers repeatedly charge at demonstrators after curfew with seemingly little provocation, shoving them onto sidewalks, striking them with batons and using other aggressive tactics.
The escalation in the use of force in New York is part of a national trend. Across the country, local police have resorted to violent tactics to control the protest movement that was ignited by the death George Floyd, a black man, as he was being held down by a white officer in Minneapolis.
The strategy has been broadly defended by both de Blasio and Shea, who said it was necessary escalation to deter looters who ransacked parts of Manhattan over the weekend.
“There comes a point where enough is enough,” de Blasio said Thursday.
But there have been few reports of looting in the last three days of unrest. Instead, police are deploying their aggressive tactics against protesters who have done little beyond violating the city’s 8 p.m. curfew to march. About 270 people were arrested Thursday night.
As images of police officers using force to arrest seemingly peaceful demonstrators circulated online, de Blasio, who ran on a platform to reform the police, came under fierce criticism from some elected officials, community leaders and even his former aides. He was jeered and booed at a memorial for Floyd on Thursday.
By Friday, after more than a week of protests, the mayor had softened his tone, pledging to review reports of police officers behaving inappropriately and promising he would announce disciplinary measures against some officers shortly.
Later, in an interview on WNYC, the mayor said the encircling of protesters was sometimes necessary for public safety.
“I don’t want to see protesters hemmed in if they don’t need to be,” he said, but he added “that sometimes there’s a legitimate problem and it’s not visible to protesters.”
On Thursday, the police commissioner said some police officers could be suspended if their behavior is found to have violated department standards. But he also said the anti-police rhetoric of the protesters and some elected officials who support them was putting officers in danger and he pointed to numerous instances in which the police had been injured with flying debris.
“We need healing,” Shea said. “We need dialogue. We need peace.”
For many protesters, however, the aggressive tactics of police to enforce the curfew have only worsened the crisis.
Axel Hernandez, 30, was protesting at Cadman Plaza on Wednesday night when police rushed into the crowd. Hernandez, who had marched several times this week, said it was one of the most peaceful demonstrations he had attended until the police charged in.
“That was the most peaceful, no bottles thrown, no anything,” he said. “The next thing I know, police rush in, with batons, and started moving people, and start hitting people.”
The kettle is a crowd control technique that has been used for decades. In theory, officers surround protesters and give them no exit, tire them out, then let them disperse in small groups.
But in New York in recent days, the maneuver has often ended with a charge and mass arrests. Since the city put a curfew in place this week, police have used the technique in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx.
According to accounts from Times journalists, other witnesses, and protesters who were arrested, many demonstrators have been trapped in kettle formations by police and have had no way to disperse. In one instance, in Manhattan, police refused to let compliant protesters leave the area and comply with their orders.
“We were asking them, ‘Where should we go?’ Everyone’s hands were in the air,” said Lucas Zwirner, one of the protesters arrested Wednesday after being surrounded by police officers in Manhattan after curfew.
Many demonstrators told police they would disperse and go home, Zwirner said, but officers would not let them through.
Police officers have used the maneuver to end some marches but not others. In Brooklyn on Wednesday, the police waited until 9 p.m. — an hour beyond the 8 p.m. curfew — to surround protesters and charge.
The day before, they allowed thousands to march peacefully across the Manhattan Bridge hours after curfew had ended and escorted a group of thousands back to Brooklyn to disperse. In the Bronx on Thursday, officers began surrounding a group of demonstrators before 8 p.m. and began making arrests by 8:02 p.m.
“We are continuing to exercise discretion,” Shea said Thursday evening. “Where we have made arrests, we have made them strategically.”

The existential question that every big tech platform from Twitter to Google to Facebook has to wrestle with is the same: How responsible should it act for the content that people post?
The answer that Silicon Valley has come up with for decades is: Less is more. But now, as protests of police brutality continue across the country, many in the tech industry are questioning the wisdom of letting all flowers bloom online.
After years of leaving President Donald Trump’s tweets alone, Twitter has taken a more aggressive approach in recent days, in several cases adding fact-checks and marks indicating the president’s tweets were misleading or glorified violence. Many Facebook employees want their company to do the same, although the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said he was against it. And Snapchat said Wednesday that it had stopped promoting Trump’s content on its main Discover page.
In the midst of this notable shift, some civil libertarians are raising a question in an already complicated debate: Any move to moderate content more proactively could eventually be used against speech loved by the people now calling for intervention.
“It comes from this drive to be protected — this belief that it’s a platform’s role to protect us from that which may harm or offend us,” said Suzanne Nossel, head of PEN America, a free-speech advocacy organization. “And if that means granting them greater authority, then that’s worth it if that means protecting people,” she added, summarizing the argument. “But people are losing sight of the risk.”
Civil libertarians caution that adding warning labels or additional context to posts raises a range of issues — issues that tech companies until recently had wanted to avoid. New rules often backfire. Fact-checks and context, no matter how sober or accurate they are, can be perceived as politically biased. More proactive moderation by the platforms could threaten their special protected legal status. And intervention goes against the apolitical self-image that some in the tech world have.
But after years of shrugging off concerns that content on social media platforms leads to harassment and violence, many in Silicon Valley appear willing to accept the risks associated with shutting down bad behavior — even from world leaders.
“Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves,” Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, wrote.
A group of early Facebook employees wrote a letter Wednesday denouncing Zuckerberg’s decision not to act on Trump’s content.
“Fact-checking is not censorship. Labeling a call to violence is not authoritarianism,” they wrote, adding, “Facebook isn’t neutral, and it never has been.”
Timothy Aveni, a Facebook employee, wrote in a separate letter that he was resigning and said, “Facebook is providing a platform that enables politicians to radicalize individuals and glorify violence.”
Ellen Pao, once the head of Reddit, the freewheeling message board, publicly rebuked her former company. She said it was hypocritical for Reddit’s leader to signal support for the Black Lives Matter movement, as he recently did in a memo, since he had left up the main Trump fan page, The_Donald, where inflammatory memes often circulate.
“You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence,” Pao wrote on Twitter. “So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don’t get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long.”
A hands-off approach by the companies has allowed harassment and abuse to proliferate online, Lee Bollinger, president of Columbia University and a First Amendment scholar, said last week. So now the companies, he said, have to grapple with how to moderate content and take more responsibility, without losing their legal protections.
“These platforms have achieved incredible power and influence,” Bollinger said, adding that moderation was a necessary response. “There’s a greater risk to American democracy in allowing unbridled speech on these private platforms.”
Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, passed in 1996, shields tech platforms from being held liable for the third-party content that circulates on them. But taking a firmer hand to what appears on their platforms could endanger that protection, most of all, for political reasons.
One of the few things that Democrats and Republicans in Washington agree on is that changes to Section 230 are on the table. Trump issued an executive order calling for changes to it after Twitter added labels to some of his tweets. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has also called for changes to Section 230.
“You repeal this, and then we’re in a different world,” said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston. “Once you repeal Section 230, you’re now left with 51 imperfect solutions.”
Blackman said he was shocked that so many liberals — especially inside the tech industry — were applauding Twitter’s decision.
“What happens to your enemies will happen to you eventually,” he said. “If you give these entities power to shut people down, it will be you one day.”
Brandon Borrman, a spokesman for Twitter, said the company was “focused on helping conversation continue by providing additional context where it’s needed.” A spokeswoman for Snap, Rachel Racusen, said the company “will not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice by giving them free promotion on Discover.” Facebook and Reddit declined to comment.
Tech companies have historically been wary of imposing editorial judgment, lest they have to act more like a newspaper, as Facebook learned several years ago when it ran into trouble with its Trending feature.
It is complicated when Dorsey begins doing that at Twitter. Does that mean a person who is now libeled on the site and asks for a fact-check gets one? And if the person doesn’t, is that grounds for a lawsuit?
The circumstances around fact-checks and added context can quickly turn political, the free-speech activists said. Which tweets should be fact-checked? Who does that fact-checking? Which get added context? What is the context that’s added? And once you have a full team doing fact-checking and adding context, what makes that different from a newsroom?
“The idea that you would delegate to a Silicon Valley board room or a bunch of content moderators at the equivalent of a customer service center the power to arbitrate our landscape of speech is very worrying,” Nossel said.
There has long been a philosophical rationale for the hands-off approach still embraced by Zuckerberg. Many in tech, especially the early creators of the social media sites, embraced a near-absolutist approach to free speech. Perhaps because they knew the power of what they were building, they did not trust themselves to decide what should go on it.
Of course, the companies already do moderate to some extent. They block nudity and remove child pornography. They work to limit doxxing — when someone’s phone number and address is shared without consent. And promoting violence is out of bounds.
They have rules that would bar regular people from saying what Trump and other political figures say. Yet they did not do anything to mark the president’s recent false tweets about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. They did do something — a label, though not a deletion — when Trump strayed into areas that Twitter has staked out: election misinformation and violence.
Many of the rules that Twitter used to tag Trump’s tweets have existed for years but were rarely applied to political figures. Critics like the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, have pointed out, for example, that the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has a Twitter account that remains unchecked.
“What does and does not incite violence is often in the eyes of the reader, and historically it has been used to silence progressive, anti-racist protest leaders,” said Nadine Strossen, a former head of the American Civil Liberties Union and an emerita law professor at New York University.
“I looked at Twitter’s definition of inciting violence, and it was something like it could risk creating violence,” she added. “Oh? Well, I think that covers a lot of speech, including anti-government demonstrators.”
Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization that defends free speech online, said people could be worried about Trump’s executive order targeting Twitter “without celebrating Twitter’s choices here.”
“I’m worried about both,” she said.

In the confusing final seconds of his life, David McAtee saw his barbecue stand in Louisville, Kentucky, fill with people seeking shelter from law enforcement.
The police and National Guard had gotten to the intersection of 26th Street and West Broadway to enforce a 9 p.m. curfew. It was past midnight, and groups of friends in the city’s predominantly black West End were mingling and listening to music outside of Dino’s Food Mart, a popular gas station hangout, and YaYa’s BBQ, McAtee’s modest restaurant.
“Go! Go!” the officers yelled. Then, they fired pepper balls.
As people rushed inside his side door to take cover, McAtee peeked out, gun in hand. He appeared to shoot.
Moments later, he lay dead, killed by a single shot to the chest. Two police officers and two Guard members had discharged their weapons, firing about 18 rounds.
What transpired in the few minutes between when law enforcement arrived and when McAtee, 53, was killed early Monday morning is now under investigation by federal and state authorities in Kentucky. Protests against police brutality had already raged in Louisville over the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Now demonstrators added another name to the list: David McAtee.
The authorities say the police and National Guard were returning McAtee’s fire. Surveillance videos released by the Louisville Metro Police Department, as well as a bystander video analyzed by the visual investigations team of The New York Times, suggest that he did shoot his gun.
But they also show, based on a synchronized chronology of the events that night, that the police had first fired at least two pepper balls from outside the restaurant toward McAtee and his relatives. One of the balls — which may not have been distinguishable at the time from other ammunition — hit a bottle on an outdoor table, and another came close to hitting his niece in the head right before McAtee fired.
The volley was intended to disperse a crowd outside the restaurant in violation of the curfew. But the gathering was not of protesters, those who were there said, but of residents who were out for a good time on a Sunday night.
“They may be violating the curfew, but I don’t know if that justifies being shot with pepper balls,” said David James, a former police officer and the president of the Louisville Metro Council, whose district includes the site of the shooting.
James, who knew McAtee, said he and other African Americans in Louisville cannot help but wonder if the authorities would have been so quick to deploy pepper balls against curfew violators in a white neighborhood.
“If they’d been in another part of town and people were out lounging in a large group like that, would they have rolled up with the National Guard and fired pepper balls, or would they have gone up and talked to people?” James said. Had the officers simply told people to clear out, James said, “I have a feeling that the outcome would have been different.”
McAtee’s relatives say he would not have knowingly shot at the police. He liked to offer officers free meals at his restaurant, named YaYa’s because YaYa was McAtee’s nickname. The barbecue stand was also McAtee’s home: He lived in the basement, said his nephew Marvin McAtee, 46, who helped run the business and was in the restaurant when the shooting began.
Law enforcement had shown up Saturday night to warn people outside about the curfew, McAtee said. When the police and National Guard pulled up early Monday morning, he thought little of it. Things sometimes got rowdy at Dino’s, where arrests were not uncommon, he said, but his uncle was on good terms with the police.
The group on YaYa’s porch consisted of maybe a half-dozen people, he said, most of them close friends listening to music and enjoying the nice weather after weeks of staying at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Several relatives were inside, helping David McAtee clean up.
People started streaming in once the pepper balls were fired. The Police Department’s policy is to shoot the balls into the ground in front of a crowd to try to disperse it, Assistant Chief LaVita Chavous said at a news conference Tuesday.
The guidelines also say officers should try to avoid the use of force to disperse nonviolent crowds, identify themselves as the police and give people a reasonable time to comply with dispersal orders.
One of the balls appeared to directly hit a soda bottle outside of YaYa’s BBQ, knocking it off a table. Another pepper ball struck the doorway. McAtee’s niece, who had approached the door from the inside, was nearly hit in the head. She backed away, security video showed.
David McAtee grabbed his gun, which was holstered on his hip, and moved toward his niece. He put his arm up and out the door. Then came the sound of a shot — his, according to the police — followed by a string of shots from the police and National Guard.
Marvin McAtee said he did not see his uncle shoot. Other people in the crowd had been armed, he said; the police recovered six handguns and one shotgun from the crime scene.
“There’s no way he had a clear vision of the police from there,” McAtee said. “He had no intention of shooting at no police.”
If he did shoot, he said, it would have been to defend his property in the belief that someone outside might be threatening it — and, above all, to protect his niece: “I know in my heart he died for her.”
Chavous said the surveillance video released by the authorities showed that David McAtee “fired his weapon out the door of his business as police approached.”
Gov. Andy Beshear said his administration had released unusually detailed information about the investigation so Kentuckians could “make determinations with their own eyes.”
“I know we have to be transparent,” he said.
On Tuesday, Mayor Greg Fischer fired Steven Conrad, the police chief, after learning that the officers involved in the shooting had failed to activate their body cameras. The firing came after years of troubling incidents that have sown mistrust in the police, including a scandal in which officers sexually assaulted teenagers in a department-run youth program. The city has also seen a spike in its murder rate.
Under pressure over Taylor’s killing, Conrad said last month that he would retire at the end of June. But McAtee’s killing sped up his departure, and Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder has taken his place for now, ahead of a national search. The city also plans to hire a consultant to review the department’s training and policies, Fischer said.
The mayor ended the curfew Thursday, saying that it had helped keep the peace but also acknowledging that the city had shown an “inability to apply it evenly.”
Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician, was killed in her apartment in March after the police tried to serve a warrant; there are differing accounts of whether they knocked on the door, and the officers said someone inside fired first. The officers in that unit were not required to wear body cameras, outraging residents and forcing a policy change. Louisville has also suspended the no-knocks warrant practice. No officers have been fired in the shooting, which is under investigation.
The two police officers who fired their weapons the night McAtee was killed, Allen Austin and Katie Crews, have been placed on administrative leave. The department also began a professional standards investigation into Crews over a Facebook post in which she referred to a photo of a female protester trying to hand her flowers.
“She was saying and doing a lot more than ‘offering flowers’ to me,” the officer wrote. “I hope the pepper balls that she got lit up with a little later on hurt. Come back and get ya some more ole girl, I’ll be on the line again tonight.”
Major Stephen Martin, a spokesman for the Kentucky National Guard, whose mission was to support the Police Department, declined to identify the two Guard members involved in the shooting.
McAtee’s grieving family and friends have spent the days since his death hearing from community members about McAtee’s generosity. James, the council president, remembered that the restaurant owner offered a free meal last year to the family of a man who was living in his car. The man did not want to accept it because he was embarrassed to have his family see him unable to pay.
“I will take care of how it appears,” McAtee said, according to James, and he made it look like the man paid for everything.

New York Times Says Senator’s Op-Ed Did Not Meet Standards [With graphic(s)]

Executives at The New York Times scrambled Thursday to address the concerns of employees and readers who were angered by the newspaper’s publication of an opinion essay by a U.S. senator calling for the federal government to send the military to suppress protests against police violence in American cities.
James Bennet, the editor in charge of the opinion section, said in a meeting with staff members late in the day that he had not read the essay before it was published. Shortly afterward, The Times issued a statement saying the essay fell short of the newspaper’s standards.
“We’ve examined the piece and the process leading up to its publication,” Eileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman, said in a statement. “This review made clear that a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an op-ed that did not meet our standards. As a result, we’re planning to examine both short-term and long-term changes, to include expanding our fact-checking operation and reducing the number of op-eds we publish.”
The op-ed, by Tom Cotton, R-Ark., was posted on the Times website Wednesday afternoon with “Send In the Troops” as its headline. “One thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers,” the senator wrote.
More than 800 staff members signed a letter protesting its publication, according to a union member involved in the letter. Addressed to high-ranking editors in the opinion and news divisions, as well as New York Times Co. executives, the letter argued that Cotton’s essay contained misinformation, such as his depiction of the role of “antifa” in the protests.
Dozens of Times employees objected to the op-ed on social media, despite a company policy that instructs them not to post partisan comments or take sides on issues. Many of them responded on Twitter with the sentence, “Running this puts Black @NYTimes staff in danger.” More than 160 employees planned a virtual walkout for Friday morning, according to two organizers of the protest.
Conversation and debate filled videoconference meetings for many newsroom departments Thursday. The newspaper scheduled a town hall meeting for Friday to allow employees to express their concerns to company leaders, including A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher; Dean Baquet, the executive editor; and Bennet, the editorial page editor.
Bennet said in a video meeting attended by Sulzberger and employees late Thursday that he had not read Cotton’s essay before it was published, according to two people who were present.
On Thursday morning, Sulzberger had sent an email to the staff backing the op-ed’s publication.
“I believe in the principle of openness to a range of opinions, even those we may disagree with, and this piece was published in that spirit,” he wrote. “But it’s essential that we listen to and reflect on the concerns we’re hearing, as we would with any piece that is the subject of significant criticism. I will do so with an open mind.”
He added, “We don’t publish just any argument — they need to be accurate, good faith explorations of the issues of the day.”
On Thursday night, Sulzberger struck a somewhat different tone in a Slack message sent to company employees. He said that “a rushed editorial process” led to the publication of an op-ed “that did not meet our standards.” He added that an editor’s note from the newspaper’s standards department was on its way.
“Given that this is not the first lapse, the opinion department will also be taking several initial steps to reduce the likelihood of something like this happening again,” Sulzberger said. He added that the opinion section would “rethink op-eds, generally” for the social media age.
Bennet had also defended publishing the op-ed early Thursday, saying in an article published on the Times website that he disagreed with Cotton’s opinion but believed that it was important to publish views that ran counter to his own.
“It would undermine the integrity and independence of The New York Times if we only published views that editors like me agreed with, and it would betray what I think of as our fundamental purpose — not to tell you what to think, but to help you think for yourself.”
Through a Times spokeswoman, Sulzberger and Bennet declined requests for interviews.
The op-ed was handled by Adam Rubenstein, an editor in the opinion section, according to staff members in that department. Several of them said they had not been aware of the article before it was published.
During the editing process, Rubenstein asked a photo editor, Jeffrey Henson Scales, for photographs of state and federal forces who were sent to the University of Mississippi in 1962 to quell segregationists protesting the enrollment of the first African American student at the school. Cotton had cited the military’s role in desegregation to make the case for sending troops into the streets.
Scales raised an objection. “A false equivalence, but historical images are there now,” he wrote to Rubenstein on Slack, the internal messaging software used by Times employees.
“Yeah, there are a few in there,” Rubenstein responded, adding an emoji of a frowning face.
Scales objected again in the opinion section’s Slack channel shortly after it was published online, calling the op-ed “highly inappropriate.” At the time he was unaware that the essay had already appeared online, he said in an interview.
Rubenstein referred a request for comment to a spokeswoman, who did not reply to inquiries.
In a video meeting of the opinion department Thursday afternoon, Bennet and James Dao, the deputy editorial page editor, acknowledged that there had been a breakdown in the process of preparing the essay for publication, according to four people who attended it. The editors said that the article had been fact-checked but added that they would fact-check it again. Dao did not reply to a request for comment.
Baquet, the executive editor, who oversees the news division, which is run separately from the opinion department, said he heard from a number of reporters and editors who believed that the op-ed did not meet the standards of The Times.
“When my newsroom is agitated, I respond to that,” he said.
He acknowledged that some readers might not be aware of the wall separating the news and opinion departments. He said he first saw the op-ed when it was posted online.
“I’ve had very sophisticated people say to me, ‘I had no idea that opinion and news were separate,’” he said, adding, “I don’t think we’ve always done the best job in the world explaining that to people and making the distinction.”
Baquet declined to comment on the substance of the op-ed but said he agreed with those who believe the opinion section should include a wide range of views.
In the days leading up to the op-ed’s publication, Cotton called for military action against what he saw as violent protests in a series of tweets. In one he called for “No quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.” Giving “no quarter” to enemy combatants is considered a war crime in modern international conflicts, under a statute of the International Criminal Court.
On Thursday, the senator tweeted his praise for Times leadership: “They ran my piece — even if they disagreed with it — and stood up to the woke progressive mob in their own newsroom.”
But after The Times said the op-ed did not meet its standards, Cotton’s office put out a statement: “We weren’t contacted by The New York Times in advance of this statement and our editorial process was similar to our past experiences at The New York Times and other publications. We’re curious to know what part of that process and this piece didn’t meet their standards.”
The senator had previously contributed to the opinion section, arguing last year that the U.S. should buy Greenland.
Cotton has also clashed with Times editors. In 2006, as an Army lieutenant serving in Iraq, Cotton called for the prosecution and imprisonment of Bill Keller, then the executive editor of The Times, and two of the paper’s reporters, Eric Lichtblau and James Risen. He accused them of violating espionage laws in reporting how U.S. counterterrorism officials had uncovered the funding schemes behind al-Qaida and other terrorist groups.
The national mood has been brought to a boil by a polarizing presidency, a once-in-a-century pandemic and the protests touched off by the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis last month.
Bennet served as the paper's Jerusalem bureau chief before taking a job as the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic in 2006. He returned to The Times, as its editorial page editor, in 2016. He has hired several young writers for the opinion section, many of them with expertise in the tech industry, and added more conservative voices. Last year, Brent Staples, a member of the opinion staff, won a Pulitzer Prize in editorial writing for a series of columns on race and America.
Bennet’s tenure has had its bumps. Last year, a federal appellate court found that Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate, could proceed with a defamation lawsuit against The Times over an editorial edited by Bennet that inaccurately linked her statements to the 2011 shooting of a U.S. congresswoman.
Two years ago, Bennet hired a journalist as the opinion department’s lead tech writer, only to rescind the job offer after a social media storm over her past use of slurs and friendship with an internet troll who had worked for a neo-Nazi website.

MOSCOW — Smarting over decades of U.S. criticism of its human rights record, Russia is now getting some payback.
The Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, sanctioned by the U.S. as a violent brute responsible for torture and extrajudicial killings, said this week that he was “horrified” by the brutality of the American police.
Russia’s foreign ministry, for its part, lamented “a real tragedy, an American tragedy” and demanded that Washington protect the rights of its own citizens instead of constantly finding fault in Russia.
“By taking measures to prevent looting and other illegal actions, authorities should not violate the rights of Americans to peaceful protest,” Maria Zakharova, the foreign ministry’s spokeswoman, said Thursday. Speaking earlier on a TV talk show, Zakharova said that because of the chaos, the U.S. “simply cannot have any questions for others in the coming years.”
The host of the show, Vladimir Solovyov, suggested that Russia commemorate George Floyd, the black man killed last week in Minneapolis, by blacklisting U.S. officials for human rights violations — just as the U.S. did to selected Russian officials following the 2009 death in a Moscow prison of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a tax lawyer for American-born financier William F. Browder.
“Russia is really enjoying this,” said Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russia’s relations with the U.S. at the European University at St. Petersburg.
The turmoil on American streets and the sometimes overly aggressive response of law enforcement officers, Kurilla said, has served two important Kremlin goals.
For one, it has deflected criticism of Russia’s own security services.
For another, videos of buildings ablaze and of sporadic looting have helped drive home one of the Kremlin’s favorite messages: That protests, even if initially peaceful, invariably risk violent disorder and so need to be nipped in the bud, as happened in Moscow last summer when the Russian police used force to break up peaceful street gatherings by opponents of President Vladimir Putin.
“The Kremlin line is that peaceful protests always escalate into riots. They want to portray all peaceful protesters as criminals. This is why they use all these pictures from the U.S.,” Kurilla said, referring to saturation coverage of riots in the U.S. on state-controlled Russian television.
Also shown repeatedly on television has been video of Floyd’s brutal death at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis.
Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia’s security services, said he had monitored Telegram channels used by Russian law enforcement officers and found them “full of expressions of horror at the behavior of the American police.”
Russian police officers, he added, are not averse to brutality but are “shocked by brutality that goes beyond what is useful or necessary.”
The killing of Floyd and scenes of police aggression directed toward peaceful American protesters and journalists, particularly those of color, has also given new life and legitimacy to a long-standing Russian critique of the U.S. that dates to the early days of the Soviet Union.
Criticism of American racism formed such an important part of Soviet propaganda that the phrase “And you hang Negroes” was widely used in the Soviet era as an official retort to the West’s Cold War claims of moral superiority.
And some black intellectuals favorably compared Soviet race relations to what they knew in America.
Writer and social activist Langston Hughes marveled during a trip to the Soviet Union during Stalin’s brutal rule in the early 1930s, at the height of a man-made famine that killed millions, that “I have at last seen a country where the dark peoples are given every opportunity.”
Contrasting the often openly racist treatment of blacks in the U.S. with his own treatment as a guest of the Soviet authorities, he wrote a small book published in Moscow, “A Negro Looks at Soviet Central Asia,” that praised what he saw as the absence of racism.
Others became less convinced that communism was the answer. Richard Wright, the author of “Native Son,” joined in 1933 the Moscow-funded Communist Party USA, believing that the Soviet Union was working to uproot racism. He quit after white members of the party withdrew an offer of housing upon discovering that he was black.
While officials have mostly avoided gloating over America’s agonies, they have nonetheless seized on the opportunity to demand that the American pot stop calling the Russian kettle black.
“I’m watching with horror the situation in the United States, where the authorities are maliciously violating ordinary citizens’ rights,” Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya, who has presided over a violent pogrom against gays in his territory, said on social media. “Police officers are carrying out lynch law right on the streets of American cities.”
Insisting that she “took no delight” from the unrest in the U.S., Zakharova, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, threw down the gauntlet to Washington over its claims to champion human rights: “Of what leadership in this direction by the United States of America can we speak after what we have all seen — after the actions of the police, and the actions against journalists,” she said.
Official outrage over Floyd’s death and its stark exposure of America’s racism problem, however, has been offset by the authorities’ strong desire to avoid encouraging protests or justifying violence.
While the Kremlin is disappointed that President Donald Trump has not delivered on his repeated pledges to “get along with Russia,” state-controlled media outlets have generally avoided attacking his handling of the crisis and sided with his demand that protesters be “dominated.”
Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a government newspaper, however, came close to mocking Trump as a coward with the headline: “Trump hid in a bunker during riots in Washington.”
And while state-backed media has denounced American racism, it has also shown some support for U.S. law-enforcement officers.
One report on Rossiya-24, a television news channel, even suggested that some American officers had been inspired to stand their ground against chaos by Russia’s example. It broadcast footage of a burly American policeman with a tattoo in Cyrillic lettering on his arm reading: “Rossiya!”
Sympathy for the police has sometimes taken an ugly turn.
Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT, a state-funded television network aimed at foreign audiences, forwarded an openly racist message on social media that suggested protesters were drug addicts and criminals.
The message, dripping with sarcasm and cast as statement of support to “the Negroes of Minnesota,” urged protesters to copy the tactics of Ukrainians who, cheered on by Washington, took to the streets in 2014 to topple their pro-Kremlin president.
“Good luck, friends,” the message said. “All progressive humanity is with you! Hit the whites until they turn black!”
Perhaps the biggest source of dismay and outrage, at least among Russian officials, however, has been a suggestion by President Barack Obama’s former national security adviser, Susan Rice, that Russia might be responsible for the chaos. In an interview with CNN early this week, Rice acknowledged that she had no evidence but said: “Based on my experience, this is right out of the Russian playbook.”
That claim has met with widespread mockery and fury, including from pro-Western liberals who despair at what they see as America’s turn, since Trump’s 2016 election, toward a Soviet-style mindset that blames all domestic problems on foreign machinations.
This, said Kurilla, the St. Petersburg scholar, has added to a steady disillusionment with many aspects of the West since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.
“Viewed from behind the Iron Curtain, America had no flaws, but after the Cold War we saw that it had lots of problems,” he said. “Reality showed that America was not as good as we thought. It has been painful.”

NEW YORK — They were held for more than a day in crowded New York City jail cells, some without masks. Cheerios and food wrappers littered the floor. In one holding pen, detainees spread tissue over a clogged toilet to try to reduce the stench emanating from it.
In the week since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, hundreds of people arrested in New York City — some while looting, others while clashing with police during largely peaceful demonstrations — have been detained in cramped cells for more than 24 hours, their health at risk in the midst of a pandemic, defense lawyers said.
On Thursday morning, more than 380 people — waiting either in cells at Police Headquarters, in local precincts and in a Manhattan jail — had yet to be brought before a judge. Nearly 70% of them had been waiting for more than 24 hours, including one defendant who had been waiting 80 hours, according to court officials and the Legal Aid Society.
Police, prosecutors and court officials say they are doing what they can to process people quickly, but they are facing logistical hurdles because of the coronavirus shutdown and an unusually high number of arrests.
But public defenders say prolonged detention of defendants violates state law and their constitutional rights. They say the police have clogged up the system by putting people through the courts who should have instead received summonses for minor offenses during the protests.
“Rather than allowing people to protest peacefully, the NYPD are violently arresting them and holding them for hours,” Stan Germán, executive director of New York County Defender Services, said in a statement. “They are unlawfully and unnecessarily sending people through the criminal arraignment process, where they face tight quarters and exposure to the coronavirus.”
Lawyers for the city deny that protesters are punitively being held longer than necessary. Mayor Bill de Blasio and his police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, have repeatedly defended the actions of rank-and file police, saying they have shown tremendous restraint in dealing with protesters under trying circumstances.
While the protests have been mostly peaceful, Shea and de Blasio have said some people have tried to incite violence against the police, throwing bricks and bottles, while others have taken advantage of the unrest to loot stores.
So far, more than 2,000 people have been arrested on charges such as disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, unlawful assembly, assault on a police officer and burglary, according to police and prosecutors. Most were released with a desk appearance ticket, which requires them to return to court at a later date.
From Sunday to Tuesday, about 500 of those people have been charged with looting shops, mostly in Manhattan, where bands of people have broken into stores throughout SoHo and the central business district, including Macy’s flagship store in Herald Square and Bloomingdale’s on Third Avenue. Many stores on Fordham Road in the Bronx were also ransacked.
The Legal Aid Society filed a lawsuit this week accusing the Police Department of illegally detaining people who had not seen a judge after waiting three days, which violates a state law requiring that a person be arraigned within 24 hours of an arrest.
On Thursday, Justice James M. Burke of state Supreme Court in Manhattan denied Legal Aid’s demand that the city release people held for more than a day, noting the Police Department was coping with widespread civil unrest in the middle of a pandemic. “It is a crisis within a crisis,” Burke said. “All writs are denied.”
Court officials blamed the delay on the police and on prosecutors, who they say have been slow to complete necessary paperwork.
“To docket the case and arraign someone, the court needs the arrest paperwork to be processed by the police and in conjunction with the district attorney to write up the criminal complaint,” Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration, said in a statement Wednesday. “It is a process that is taking a far longer time frame than is customary.”
One protester, Khelon Robinson-Fraser, 21, of Atlanta, said he heard officers threaten to delay processing several people’s paperwork if they asked too many questions or became fussy. “‘We can keep you for however long we want,’” he recalled an officer tell one detainee. “It was just pretty horrible.”
But Patricia Miller, chief of the city’s Special Federal Litigation Division, denied that officers were retaliating against protesters and said that the agency was doing the best it could given the circumstances. She called the allegations “exceptionally unfair.”
“The NYPD, as well as the entire criminal court system, is working within the confines of a pandemic and is now suddenly called upon not only to secure orderly protesting but also to address rioters who are committing burglaries, destroying private property and assaulting fellow New Yorkers,” Miller said.
During the court hearing on Legal Aid’s request, Janine Gilbert, an assistant deputy police commissioner, acknowledged that social distancing has been impossible in city lockups with so many arrests. She said, for instance, it was common for up to two dozen people to be held for hours on buses before being taken to be booked.
“And I might note that these protesters while they are out on the street are not social distancing either,” she said. She said each detainee was given a mask and offered food while in the holding pen.
The court system, which had already been disrupted by the coronavirus, has been largely virtual since March. Since then, judges, defense lawyers and prosecutors have conducted arraignments from their homes over video chat systems.
But the recent flood of arrests has added even more pressure, officials said.
To handle the backlog, court officials added a second virtual arraignment part and an overnight arraignment session from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m., Chalfen said. Most of the people awaiting arraignment were charged with burglary, and in most cases must be released without bail under the state’s new bail law, Chalfen said.
De Blasio initially blamed the widespread looting and instances of violence on out-of-towners and anarchists, but in recent days he and his police commissioner acknowledged that most of the people accused of breaking into stores were city residents using the protests as cover. Some had even used cars and trucks — in one instance a U-Haul truck — to transport stolen merchandise, police said.
De Blasio said the protests have been largely peaceful but added that there was “an organized group of criminals doing things like looting for pure financial gain, pure criminal gain, nothing to do with protests whatsoever.”
At least one-quarter of the people arrested have been accused of burglary, which is the charge brought against looters, according to preliminary figures from the police.
As he left the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, Marcos Parker, 19, said he had been detained on a burglary charge on Monday and was not released until Wednesday.
“I won’t lie. I was looting,” he said. He said he had stolen merchandise because he had lost his job. “It was really this coronavirus,” he said. “I was working before corona.”
Nearby, a 26-year-old woman, who requested anonymity, said her boyfriend waited two days to see a judge after he was charged with looting.
But others have faced charges of assaulting a police officer. One 26-year-old was accused of throwing a garbage can into a crowd, striking an officer. A 33-year-old man was charged with assault; according to the criminal complaint, he punched an officer in the face.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan say they are investigating several allegations of police using unnecessary force, including an instance — captured on video — when two police SUVs drove into a crowd of protesters blocking a street in Brooklyn and a separate incident in which a Wall Street Journal reporter says an officer assaulted him in Manhattan.
Federal prosecutors have brought charges against two sisters from the Catskills region who investigators say tried to firebomb a police vehicle with officers inside it.
Some of the protesters, who were released this week after long detentions, said the police officers were the aggressors.
Clarence Johnson, a 24-year-old chef from Harlem, said he and his brother were protesting on 34th Street in Manhattan on Monday when officers tackled them, used pepper spray on them and then hit them with batons. Johnson said he had bruising on his hip and that his brother’s face was swollen.
The officers had told them to go home, he said, but then had boxed them in on the street before arresting them on charges of unlawful assembly.
Johnson said he waited 15 hours to be arraigned. By Wednesday evening, his brother still had not appeared before a judge. Johnson was held in a cell with about 30 people spaced only about 2 feet apart, with a clogged toilet, and no soap. Some detainees were coughing and others appeared sickly, he said.
Johnson said he had experienced many disturbing encounters with the police while growing up in New York City. He was stopped frequently by them as a teenager and had stared down the barrel of an officer’s gun more than once. For him, the protests against police brutality were extremely personal.
“I have a daughter, a little girl, that’s going to have to grow up in this world,” Johnson said. “I just want it to be how it’s supposed to be. I shouldn’t have to fear the police.”
Another protester, Dorthley Beaval, 20, a nursing student from Long Island, emerged from the courthouse on Wednesday evening with his left arm in a dark blue sling. The left side of his face was bruised.
He said a police officer picked him up, slammed him first against a wall and then face down on the ground. The officer then began punching him repeatedly until another officer stopped him, he said. One tooth had been loosened, and he coughed up blood, he said. He spent two days in a cell waiting to see a judge. He was charged with burglary and criminal mischief.
“I was there peacefully protesting because of this type of behavior,” he said. That night he had held a sign that read “For My Future Black Children.”

Murkowski Endorses Mattis Criticism of Trump, Calling it ‘Necessary and Overdue’ [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Thursday that she endorsed scathing criticism of President Donald Trump’s leadership by Jim Mattis, the former secretary of defense, and was grappling with whether to support the president in the coming election.
Murkowski said the critique by Mattis, in which he said that Trump had divided the nation and failed to lead amid growing protests across the country, was “necessary and overdue,” and might prod other Republicans to go public with their private concerns about the president.
“I was really thankful,” she told reporters on Capitol Hill. “I thought General Mattis’ words were true and honest and necessary and overdue.”
The comments by Murkowski, one of the few Republicans in Congress who have been willing to break with the president on occasion, suggested that Trump’s response to nationwide unrest over police brutality and racial discrimination had emboldened at least some members of his party to speak out against him. While many Republicans privately regard the president’s conduct with distaste and even alarm, few have been willing to publicly air those concerns.
In apparent response to Murkowski’s comments, Trump vowed Thursday evening to campaign against her in two years, when her term ends, pointing to her votes against legislation that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. (While Murkowski said she did not support the confirmation, her vote was recorded as “present” as part of an agreement with a colleague who missed the vote.)
“Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don’t care, I’m endorsing,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “If you have a pulse, I’m with you!”
In recent days, more Republicans have been willing to voice their differences, with a pandemic raging and protests exposing a sense of anguish about the treatment of black Americans.
Trump drew a rare bipartisan rebuke this week after he threatened to unleash the military to crack down on protests, just as the police were using chemical agents and flash bangs against demonstrators outside the White House to clear a path for him to pose outside a church. A handful of Republicans, including the party’s lone black senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, denounced the episode.
Murkowski said she had been “encouraged” by a lengthy statement issued on Tuesday by President George W. Bush, who did not mention Trump but expressed solidarity with demonstrators and warned against trying to suppress the protests. When she saw Mattis’ comments, Murkowski added, “I felt like perhaps we’re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally, and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up.”
She said she was “working as one individual to form the right words.”
Asked whether she could still support Trump in the election in November, Murkowski said: “I am struggling with it. I have struggled with it for a long time.”
Murkowski, who was elected to her third full term in 2016, did not endorse Trump that year, and after a recording surfaced of him boasting about sexually assaulting women, she publicly repudiated his candidacy, saying that he had “forfeited the right to be our party’s nominee.”
Still, Murkowski has usually tempered her public criticism of the president, as have many other Republicans.
On Thursday, several Republican senators continued to do so, with some insisting they had not seen Mattis’ remarks or deflecting questions about them. Those who challenged Trump did so gently or obliquely.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, another frequent critic of the president, stopped short of commenting on the substance of Mattis’ critique but praised him effusively.
“He’s an American patriot,” Romney said of the former defense secretary. “He’s an individual whose judgment I respect, and I think the world of him.”
“What a wonderful, wonderful man,” he added.
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who said he had not read Mattis’ rebuke, carefully suggested that Trump might have set the wrong tone for meeting the painful moment that the nation was facing.
“I happen to think the president has said the right things with regard to what happened in Minneapolis — he said it was a horrible situation,” Portman said. “The question is tone and words, and I think some of the tone and some of the words used should be focused more on healing.”
Still others rejected outright the criticisms of Trump. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of the president, said that Mattis had been taken in by a “liberal media” that was bent on blaming Trump for everything.
“I’m not saying he’s blameless,” Graham said of the president during an interview on Fox News, “but I am saying that you’re buying into a narrative that I think is, quite frankly, unfair.”
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, suggested that the former secretary might have been acting out of spite. He told reporters on Thursday that he considered Mattis to be “one of my favorite people,” but added, “once you’re fired, sometimes that affects your attitude.”
Later Thursday, Murkowski diverted momentarily from a speech about the anniversary of women securing the right vote to talk about the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, and the protests that his killing helped inspire.
“I have been chastised by some very close friends, who have said, ‘You’re silent, Lisa. Why are you silent?’” she said. “And I have struggled. I have struggled with the right words, as a white woman born and raised in Alaska with a family that was privileged.”

Employers continue to lay workers off while states struggle through a backlog of unemployment claims, a sign of the persistent strain the economy faces from the coronavirus pandemic even as businesses begin to reopen.
The Labor Department reported Thursday that nearly 1.9 million Americans filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, continuing the decline from the more than 6 million who submitted applications in a single week in March but still a remarkably high level.
In addition, there were 623,000 new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the federal program intended to help the self-employed and others not normally eligible for state jobless benefits.
The overall number collecting state benefits increased by almost 650,000 to a seasonally adjusted total of 21.5 million, showing that even as some businesses reopen and workers come off the rolls, others are being newly laid off or belatedly starting to receive benefits.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the weekly claims “are not falling as fast as I’d like them to fall or thought they would be falling.”
“Let’s not kid ourselves,” he added. “This is still an astonishing rate of layoffs.”
Since mid-March, 42.6 million jobless workers have applied for state aid, marking the worst period for unemployment since the Great Depression. The seasonally adjusted data does not include those who have applied under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.
The government count also leaves out people who were stymied in their attempts to access the benefits or were too disheartened or confused to try. Mistakes, delays in reporting and possible double-counting in some areas also complicate efforts to arrive at a precise total.
Some people out of work have gone months without government assistance as states grapple with technical glitches and a flood of claims. Payments have abruptly evaporated for some workers, who have struggled to reach overwhelmed unemployment administrators for an explanation.
Bogus sites that mimic government unemployment portals, and fraudulent claims submitted using stolen personal data, have prompted many states to impose security measures that complicate the approval process.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said the recent looting and vandalism in many cities further clouded the employment outlook.
“The unrest adds insult to injury in an economy already struggling to reopen,” she said. “It could delay workers being called back or cause people to be laid off again.”
For many jobless workers, stability remains a distant prospect. On Friday, the Labor Department will report the May unemployment rate, which many economists say could approach or exceed 20%, up from 14.7% in April.
The layoffs have grown from the restaurant workers and hotel employees who lost their jobs early in the pandemic to people in management positions, economists said. And state unemployment offices are wading through a backlog of claims, processing older applications that may only now be appearing in official counts.
The economic rebound will probably unfurl in two phases, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. The first will happen quickly, as companies call back certain employees to help reopen restaurants, retailers and other operations. The second step will drag on for months, as lingering fears of infection and the disruption in earnings weigh on spending and affect the ability of businesses, especially small ones, to return to normal.
He said it was encouraging that initial applications for state benefits and for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program declined last week but added that the volume was still stunning and likely to remain elevated.
“We’re witnessing a gradual evolution from temporary to persistent labor market damage,” he said.
The pandemic has gone on so long that some workers are reaching the end of their allotment of benefits — and some could face more delays as states try to carry out a federal program that offers an extra 13 weeks of aid.
“There might be a series of income cliffs coming up as benefits fade out, and tranches of the population that may have helped spur a rebound in spending may drop off,” Daco said.
Unemployed workers in most of the country are eligible for 26 weeks of regular state benefits, which would give someone laid off in mid-March a cushion until September. States like Michigan and Kansas, which usually offer fewer weeks of payments, recently raised their maximum allowances to 26 weeks. But Florida and North Carolina cap their unemployment payouts at 12 weeks.
The federal extension program, known as Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, could give workers a lifeline into December. Some states may offer additional extended benefits.
But Diana Terlingo, 55, has yet to receive any payment.
Terlingo, who was furloughed in mid-April from her job approving travel expenses for a retail chain, said work petered out after employees stopped going on business trips.
She began working again two weeks ago, operating out of her home in Pembroke Pines, Florida. In the six weeks she was unemployed, she received none of the $5,000 she believes she is owed in state and federal aid.
Her husband, who runs a family business selling modular office furniture that has had no customers for weeks, secured a $16,000 loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program but did not seek benefits through the state. Their son Sean O’Reilly, 31, was furloughed in mid-March from a hotel restaurant and would be on the verge of exhausting his unemployment payments from Florida if the money had ever arrived.
For now, the family has avoided disaster, having saved diligently for years and arranged flexibility with creditors.
“We’re in a better position than some people,” Terlingo said. “We’re not the starving ones.”
As businesses reopen, jobless workers are starting to seek in-person help. At job fairs around the country, hospitals are seeking nurses and school districts are looking for bus drivers. CareerSource Florida, a state agency helping job seekers, recently began offering on-site assistance by appointment. Last month, the Alabama Department of Labor set up stations around Montgomery to help people with their claims but limited the number of visitors and suggested that they bring lawn chairs and snacks to pass the time in line.
The increased activity has led to optimism that the job market has started “crawling out of the hole,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “We do have the worst behind us.”
Eric Latham, a 26-year-old restaurant worker living in Fayette, spent days calling the Alabama agency after nearly $1,600 in benefits failed to show up in his account. While updating his unemployment claim one week, he noted that he had briefly worked for his employer for one day during his furlough, a detail that seemed to cut off his payments.
“That was two weeks of very little income — that set me back,” he said. “I need it. I have bills. But I’ll probably just have to eat it.”
Latham returned to work Thursday, despite reservations about the coronavirus. Reopening efforts are proceeding slowly, as government officials and business owners try to stave off more infections.
Many workers remain in limbo.
Donald Franklin III, 21, was furloughed in March from his manufacturing job in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh near the Ohio border. He received one unemployment check and has tried in vain to reach the Pennsylvania unemployment office to inquire after the rest of his benefits.
Now home in Ohio, he is worried about having enough money to pay his bills. He received some family money, scaled back his spending and asked for an extension on his internet bill.
Eager to get back to work, he is hoping for a call from his employer, which has begun restoring shifts. But because Franklin works nights, he is concerned that rioting could lead to curfews that keep him from traveling to his job. He is also nervous that if the stores that carry his company’s products are looted, demand might tumble.
Franklin, who is of mixed race, sympathizes with protesters demonstrating against police violence.
“There definitely needs to be a change in the world right now,” he said. “I can definitely see where everyone is coming from. I totally understand all the perspectives. I’m just worried about my livelihood.”

SEATTLE — A black man who called out “I can’t breathe” before dying in police custody in Tacoma, Washington, was killed as a result of oxygen deprivation and the physical restraint that was used on him, according to details of a medical examiner’s report released Wednesday.
The Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office concluded that the death of the man, Manuel Ellis, 33, was a homicide. Investigators with the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department were in the process of preparing a report about the March death, which occurred shortly after an arrest by officers from the Tacoma Police Department, said the sheriff’s spokesman, Ed Troyer.
“The information is all being put together,” Troyer said. “We expect to present it to the prosecutor at the end of this week or early next week.”
Ellis’s sister, Monet Carter-Mixon, called for action to bring accountability in the death and further scrutiny of both the Police Department’s practices and how the investigation into his death has been handled.
“There’s a lot of questions that still need to be answered,” Carter-Mixon said.
Ellis died from respiratory arrest, hypoxia and physical restraint, according to the medical examiner’s office. The report listed methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease as contributing factors.
Police officers encountered Ellis, a musician and father of two from Tacoma, on the night of March 3 as they were stopped at an intersection. They saw him banging on the window of another vehicle, Troyer said.
Ellis approached the officers, Troyer said, and then threw an officer to the ground when the officer got out of the vehicle. The two officers and two backup officers who joined — two of them white, one black and one Asian — handcuffed him.
“Mr. Ellis was physically restrained as he continued to be combative,” the Tacoma Police Department said in a statement Wednesday.
Troyer said he did not know all the details of the restraint the officers used — they were not wearing body cameras — but said he did not believe they used a chokehold or a knee on Ellis’ neck. They rolled him on his side after he called out, “I can’t breathe.”
“The main reason why he was restrained was so he wouldn’t hurt himself or them,” Troyer said. “As soon as he said he couldn’t breathe, they requested medical aid.”
Troyer said the call for aid came four minutes after the officers encountered Ellis.
Ellis was still breathing when medical personnel arrived, Troyer said. He was removed from handcuffs while personnel worked on him for about 40 minutes, Troyer said. He was then pronounced dead.
Family members said Ellis was the father of an 11-year-old son and 18-month-old daughter. He was a talented musician at his church. Carter-Mixon said Ellis was like a father figure to her boys, coaching them on things like how handle themselves to keep safe in a world of racial injustices.
“My heart literally hurts,” she said. “It’s painful. My brother was my best friend.”
On Wednesday night, she and others held a vigil in Tacoma.
Brian Giordano, a close friend of Ellis, said that the two usually spoke several times a day and that Ellis had videochatted with him two hours before his death. He had been excited about a church service he had attended and proud of how he had played drums during the service, Giordano recalled.
He said it would be uncharacteristic of Ellis to act in the violent way described by the police.
He was living in a clean-and-sober house and was getting his life back together, he said. “He was always uplifting,” Giordano said. “He was always on the up-and-up about taking care of people.”
The death comes as protests have spread around the nation over the case of George Floyd, a black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police last week. Minnesota officials have charged all four officers in that case, including Derek Chauvin, who kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes during the arrest.
Forensics experts who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family concluded that another officer’s knees on Floyd’s back contributed to making it impossible for his lungs to take in sufficient air.
Mayor Victoria Woodards of Tacoma said Wednesday that she would take appropriate steps based on the findings of the sheriff’s investigation.
“We will learn the results of that investigation even as our country reels from the recent killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many others,” Woodards said.
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said the issue was a top priority for him.
“We will be pushing to make sure there is a full and complete investigation of that incident,” Inslee said.

MINNEAPOLIS — For nearly three months, Americans have avoided most collective outpourings of grief as fears of the coronavirus converted funerals of lost friends and family into painfully socially distanced affairs.
But hundreds of people were expected to turn up Thursday for a memorial service for George Floyd, a man whose recent death in police custody has elicited such outrage across the country that it has pushed fears of a global pandemic into the background.
“We have to be united, even with COVID,” said Yousif Hussein, 29, who was planning to attend the memorial for Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes during an arrest.
“I have to show solidarity with George Floyd,” Hussein said outside the corner market in midtown Minneapolis where Floyd made his final gasps — for help, for his mother and for air, a plea that has since become a painful refrain for racial and social justice in America: “I can’t breathe.”
Floyd’s death came after a deli employee called 911, accusing him of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. A video of his last moments, as three other uniformed officers did not intervene, set off protests in dozens of cities and led to criminal charges this week against all four police officers. At least six people have died in violence connected to the protests.
On Wednesday, the Hennepin County medical examiner released Floyd’s autopsy report, which revealed that he had tested positive for the coronavirus in early April, although it gave no indication that the virus factored into his death. The news came as a gut punch, a painful reminder of how the virus has hit the black community in Minnesota, and throughout the nation, in disproportionate numbers.
Thursday’s memorial service is scheduled to take place at 1 p.m. in a large sanctuary at North Central University in Minneapolis. Other services for Floyd were planned for Saturday in Raeford, North Carolina, where some of his family lives, and Monday in Houston, where he lived for many years.
The service, to be led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, comes a day after enhanced charges were announced against the police officer who wedged his knee onto Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, as well as the new charges against three other officers who participated in the arrest. All have been fired.
The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis police force over Floyd’s death, pledging to investigate whether the department has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices.
Sharpton said he would announce a new social movement at Thursday’s memorial service and would call for federal legislation aimed at putting an end to racial injustice by police.
On Wednesday, Quincy Mason, the son of George Floyd, for the first time visited the site where his father was pinned to the ground, dropping to one knee on a chalk drawing depicting Floyd’s body with wings and a crown and the words, “I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.”
“My father should not have been killed like this,” Mason said later that day.
The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, said Floyd’s death was a moment for the city to come together and address “systemic racism head on.”
“George Floyd’s life was defined by peace and love for his family and friends,” the mayor said in a statement. “But he was denied mercy in Minneapolis when our officers failed to recognize George’s humanity. That can’t be where his story ends.”
Floyd had been a star football and basketball player in high school in Houston, moving to Minneapolis about five years ago. Family and friends described him as happy, careful not to judge and easy to talk to.
When he returned to Houston for his mother’s funeral two years ago, he told a cousin that Minneapolis had come to feel like home.
The city he adopted already is filled with tributes and memorials; the names of other black men and women who have been killed by police officers across the country are scrawled in large pink, blue, yellow and green chalk letters on the street where Floyd was arrested.
The display is alongside a place where many of those passing through the now-famous neighborhood have gathered in recent days. J.T. McReynolds, 11, had memorized all of the names, rattling them off in a tiny voice this week as he sought shade in a car parked under a tree while he and his parents took a break from a day of protesting.
“Sean Bell. Trayvon Martin,” the boy began, and then paused. “It’s just hurtful. We’re trying to be peaceful and get justice for George Floyd.”
Plans were being finalized at the last minute for the memorial service at a chapel that holds several hundred people. Social distancing was expected to be in place for mourners.
The service will be for family, friends and invitees of the Floyd family, according to the university’s website. Local media planned to livestream the event, and many people demonstrating Wednesday said they had intended to gather in an area outside the chapel to pay respects during the service.
Besides Sharpton, Ben Crump, a civil rights attorney who is representing some of Floyd’s family, also will speak.
Among those planning to attend the memorial service is Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 when a New York police officer placed him in a fatal chokehold. His last words, “I can’t breathe” — repeated years later in another city by Floyd — galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement.
“It just feels like I’m coming to my son’s funeral again,” Carr said Wednesday in Minneapolis. “This young man was crying for his mother at the end. That was like my son echoing from the grave saying, ‘Mama, you’ve got to do something. They’re still killing us.’ ”

The Minneapolis Police Department late Wednesday released 235 pages of personnel records for the four former officers charged in George Floyd’s killing on May 25, all of whom were fired after video of his death emerged the following day.
Three of the officers — Thomas Lane, 37; J. Alexander Kueng, 26; and Tou Thao, 34 — were charged Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, court records show, and are scheduled to appear in court Thursday afternoon.
The fourth officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, who was arrested last week, now faces an increased charge of second-degree murder and is scheduled to appear in court Monday.
Many of the pages of the personnel files were heavily redacted, but they revealed details of the officers’ lives before joining the department and during their time on the force.

Chauvin appears to have been reprimanded and possibly suspended after a woman complained in 2007 that he needlessly removed her from her car, searched her and put her in the back of a squad car for driving 10 mph over the speed limit.
Chauvin was the subject of at least 17 misconduct complaints over two decades, but the woman’s complaint is the only one detailed in 79 pages of his heavily redacted personnel file. The file shows that the complaint was upheld and that Chauvin was issued a letter of reprimand.
“Officer did not have to remove complainant from car,” read the investigators’ finding. “Could’ve conducted interview outside the vehicle.”
In one part of the records, the discipline imposed is listed as “letter of reprimand,” but Chauvin was also issued a “notice of suspension” in May 2008, just after the investigation into the complaint ended, that lists the same internal affairs case number.
Investigators wrote that there was no audio of the incident and that the dashcam “had been turned off during course of stop.”
The records say Chauvin admitted to leaving a microphone in the squad car during the traffic stop and “did not check” the dashcam at the start of his shift.
In applying to the Minneapolis Police Department, Chauvin said he had served as a member of the U.S. Army, working for a time as a member of the military police. He also said he had worked as a security guard and as a cook for McDonald’s and another restaurant in the mid-1990s. The records said he was hired by the department in January 2001 as a part-time community service officer.
J. Alexander Kueng
Kueng had been an officer with the department for less than six months. He joined the force as a cadet in February 2019 and became an officer Dec. 10, 2019, his personnel records show. He had previously worked as a community service officer with the department while he earned his bachelor’s degree in sociology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
He also worked as a security guard at a Macy’s and stocked shelves at a Target, and graduated from Minneapolis’ Patrick Henry High School in 2012.
Otherwise, most of his personnel file was blacked out, including basic details like whether he had a driver’s license, whether he lived in Minneapolis, whether he had any convictions for a long list of crimes, whether he was a U.S. citizen, and what his college GPA was.
His file shows that he was terminated May 26, the day after Floyd’s death, at 4:45 p.m. It says he was fired for substandard performance, misconduct and violations of the city’s use-of-force policy, including failure to stop another officer from applying inappropriate force.
Thomas Lane
Lane did not graduate from high school, his file shows, but he went on to get his GED, then an associate degree from Century College and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota in criminology.
He was accepted to the police academy in January 2019 but started working in the criminal justice system in 2017 as a probation officer. Lane previously worked a series of different jobs, from restaurant server to Home Depot sales associate. He volunteered at Ka Joog tutoring, working with Somali youth in Cedar Riverside.
Tou Thao
Thao held jobs at McDonald’s, at a grocery store as a stocker, and as a security guard before being hired in 2008 as a community service officer in Minneapolis. But he worked there less than two years before being laid off in late 2009 because of budget cuts. Almost two years later, in 2011, he was recalled, then hired as a police officer in 2012.
Thao graduated in 2004 from Fridley High School and attended North Hennepin Community College, where he studied for an associate degree in law enforcement but never graduated, according to his file.
According to police department data, Thao faced at least six complaints in his career with the Minneapolis force and also was the subject of a lawsuit that claimed he and another officer punched, kicked and kneed an African American man, leaving the man with broken teeth and bruises.

Dozens of American cities remained under curfew Wednesday night, but some began to relax their restrictions amid signs of a reduction in the widespread violence, vandalism and civil unrest that broke out across the country following the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Protests continued during the day and were largely peaceful, reinforcing hopes that the most serious convulsions had passed, especially after three more officers were charged in the death of Floyd. But each day since the turmoil began, serious trouble has not emerged until nighttime, leaving local and state officials again bracing for renewed disturbances as evening approached.
The unrest was far less destructive Tuesday than it had been the previous few nights, as both law enforcement officers and people in the streets appeared less eager for confrontation.
“The largest group of protesters that we have seen to this point have been doing a little bit of self-policing,” Peter Newsham, the police chief of Washington, D.C., said.
Floyd, 46, a black resident of a Minneapolis suburb, died after gasping “I can’t breathe” while a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder, but on Wednesday, Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, filed a more severe charge, second-degree murder, and also charged the three other officers who were involved in the arrest.
“His life had value,” Ellison said of Floyd. “We will seek justice for him and for you, and we will find it.”
While some cities and states eased their curfews, others kept them in place.
— Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles pushed back their curfews from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and neighboring Santa Monica moved its curfew from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. “We saw mass amounts of people protesting peacefully” last night, the county’s sheriff, Alex Villanueva said. “As a result, hopefully we can start altering the curfew.”
— Washington moved back its curfew from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. In the afternoon, several hundred protesters lay face down on the pavement, as Floyd had, in eerie silence outside the Capitol.
— The mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, maintained a 9 p.m. curfew but reopened street access to the downtown area and allowed businesses there to reopen. The regional commuter rail system resumed service after being shut down for two days.
— New York City, where there was extensive looting Monday night, remained under an 8 p.m. curfew, a day after thousands of peaceful protesters defied it.
— The mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina, Mary-Ann Baldwin, extended an 8 p.m. curfew, despite a quieter night Tuesday, calling the decision “incredibly difficult.”
— Minnesota’s governor kept in place a 10 p.m. curfew in St. Paul and Minneapolis, where a memorial service for Floyd will be held Thursday.
— Atlanta not only maintained its 9 p.m. curfew but announced that it would begin an hour earlier Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Minnesota’s attorney general asked for patience and time to build the case.
Ellison asked the public Wednesday for patience during a criminal investigation that would take months to complete, and he cautioned that history showed the challenges of prosecuting police officers.
“Trying this case will not be an easy thing,” he said. “Winning a conviction will be hard.”
He also called on protesters to continue peaceful demonstrations and to work toward more lasting change.
“The very fact we have filed these charges means we have believed in them,” Ellison said. “But what I do not believe is that one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel.”
Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, including for 2 minutes 53 seconds after Floyd fell unresponsive, according to the initial charging document released by prosecutors.
The other officers did not stop Chauvin, and Lane and Kueng helped hold Floyd to the ground for at least part of the time, while Thao stood nearby, according to video reconstruction of the arrest by The New York Times. Lane asked at one point whether they should turn Floyd onto his side, prosecutors said, but Chauvin said “no, staying put where we got him.”
At first, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder, a charge that Floyd’s family had criticized as too lenient. He was also charged with second-degree manslaughter. Ellison announced an addition of second-degree murder Wednesday.
In Minnesota, second-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove either that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, or that he did so while committing another felony. A court filing indicated that prosecutors planned to take the latter approach. The maximum penalty is 40 years in prison.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.”
Under Minnesota law, second-degree murder comes with a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and accomplices can be eligible for the same penalties as the primary defendant.
But if they are convicted, it is likely that the officers could get far less than that, under standard sentencing guidelines that suggest the equivalent of 12 years in prison for the typical second-degree murder case, said Richard Frase, a professor of criminal law at the University of Minnesota.
“The statutory maximum is designed for the worst possible case,” he said, adding that judges have substantial latitude in sentencing depending on the facts of the case. “There is obviously a lot of pressure to really be tough on these officers, but this case isn’t going to be sentenced probably for two years.”
Floyd had coronavirus weeks before his death.
Floyd had the coronavirus in early April, nearly two months before he died, according to a full autopsy released by the Hennepin County medical examiner Wednesday.
Dr. Andrew Baker, the county’s top medical examiner, said that the Minnesota Department of Health had swabbed Floyd’s nose after his death, and that he had tested positive for the virus, but that it was likely a lasting positive result from his previous infection.
There is no indication that the virus played any role in his death, and Baker said Floyd was likely asymptomatic at the time he died.
Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who was among two doctors who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family last week, said county officials did not tell him that Floyd had tested positive for COVID-19.
“The funeral director wasn’t told, and we weren’t told, and now a lot of people are running around trying to get tested,” Baden said. “If you do the autopsy and it’s positive for the coronavirus, it’s usual to tell everyone who is going to be in touch with the body. There would have been more care.”
The four police officers who arrested Floyd should also get tested, as should some of the witnesses, Baden said. “I’m not angry,” he said. “But there would have been more care.”
Baden said the full autopsy includes information he did not have access to, such as the toxicology results showing Floyd had fentanyl in his system. He added that when he conducted the autopsy, part of the heart was not provided — the part that showed coronary artery disease.
Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he was struck by the difference between the county’s official autopsy and the results of Baden’s private autopsy. The county’s report does not refer to any hemorrhaging near the carotid, as the private autopsy did.
Kobilinsky said defense lawyers could make a point of the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body. Although the amount required to be lethal varies from person to person, fentanyl can stop a person’s heart and a person’s breathing, he said. “It seems to me, it’s high enough where a defense attorney would argue that this kind of predisposes him to heart failure, when you are on a drug like this,” he said.
Baden acknowledged that the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body was “considerable,” which would be particularly important if he had never used the drug before.
“He has enough that could be a cause of death if he had never had immunity or tolerance to the drug,” Baden said. But there was nothing in the full autopsy that made him change his medical opinion. “Restraint is what caused the death,” he said.
Lawyers for Floyd’s family could not immediately be reached for comment.
Bay Area Incensed By Fatal Police Shooting
A police officer in the Bay Area shot and killed a kneeling man after mistaking a hammer in the man’s pocket for a gun, the authorities said Wednesday.
The episode, which took place in Vallejo, California, early Tuesday, further incensed residents who have been protesting Floyd’s death.
The man, Sean Monterrosa, who was Hispanic, was attempting to flee a Walgreens that was being looted, said the city’s police chief, Shawny Williams.
Monterrosa, 22, a San Francisco resident, ran toward a car that had earlier rammed into a police cruiser and injured a different officer, Williams said.
Monterrosa appeared to be running toward the car “but suddenly stopped, taking a kneeling position and placing his hands above his waist, revealing what appeared to be the butt of a handgun,” the chief said. “Investigations later revealed that the weapon was a long, 15-inch hammer.”
Williams said that the officer, whom he did not name, believed that Monterrosa posed a danger.
“Due to this perceived threat, one officer fired his weapon five times from within the police vehicle through the windshield” he said. Monterrosa was hit once and died.
The Solano County District Attorney’s Office and the Vallejo Police Department are conducting criminal investigations into the use of deadly force by the officer, an 18-year police veteran.
The chief said the department would release body camera footage of the confrontation.
Louisville’s mayor orders an outside review of city police
The city of Louisville, Kentucky, will hire an outside consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of its police department, after the recent fatal shootings of two black residents — Breonna Taylor in March and David McAtee early Monday.
Mayor Greg Fischer, who announced the review in a news conference Wednesday, said the consultant would be asked to examine the Louisville Metro Police Department’s policies on training, use of force and bias, among other matters, and that the review would include listening sessions with residents. The mayor called the review “an exciting moment of opportunity for our police department and the city.”
The announcement came as the city is searching for a new police chief. Fischer fired the previous chief, Steven Conrad, on Tuesday after learning that officers did not have their body cameras turned on when McAtee was killed Monday. Conrad was due to retire in a few weeks.
McAtee, who was 53, owned a popular barbecue restaurant where a crowd had gathered outside Sunday night, after the city’s 9 p.m. curfew. Shortly past midnight, two Louisville police officers and two National Guard members on the scene heard gunshots and fired their guns, and McAtee was killed.
Taylor, who was 26, was killed in March when the police executed a “no-knock” search warrant at her home. Outrage over her death has helped to fuel six days of protests in the city. At a demonstration last Thursday, seven people were struck by gunfire.
States begin to weigh new checks on the police
The national response to Floyd’s death has begun to move from the streets into statehouses, as lawmakers across the country seek to harness outrage at police abuses.
— In California, lawmakers advanced legislation Wednesday to reconsider the state’s landmark ban on affirmative action and to examine reparations for slavery.
— Democrats in Colorado introduced a bill to extend a ban on chokeholds and to permanently decertify and end immunity from prosecution for law enforcement officers convicted of unlawful use of force.
— Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin urged passage of legislation aimed at minimizing the use of lethal police force.
— New Jersey’s attorney general said the state would update its use-of-force guidelines for the first time in two decades.
— In Maryland, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers last week announced a police reform working group.
— After receiving thousands of complaints about the police’s tactics used in recent days, Seattle has decided to drop its effort to remove federal oversight of its police department, which has been in place since 2012.
Whether the efforts will succeed, or curb the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement, is unclear. Nearly half the states passed some form of legislation after the 2014 deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York, and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland. But only about a third have specifically tightened restrictions on the use of lethal police force, according to The Associated Press. Such changes have been resisted by police organizations.
Dominated by Democrats, California has mounted one of the more aggressive policy responses to Floyd’s death. This week, Bay Area district attorneys asked the state to bar local prosecutors, who handle complaints of police misconduct, from taking campaign contributions from police unions, and the San Francisco public defender called for an overhaul of use-of-force policies in that city.
San Diego’s police chief announced that the department will no longer use the neck restraint employed on Floyd, a technique that has long been restricted in many departments nationally.
California’s measures on reparations and affirmative action will be heard later this week by the state’s Assembly. If passed, the affirmative action proposal would go to the state’s voters on the November ballot, giving them a chance to repeal a 1996 initiative that bans public institutions from offering preferential treatment in education, contracting or employment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.
Far-right extremists charged in Las Vegas
Three men linked to a loose national network of far-right extremists advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government faced charges Wednesday of trying to foment violence in Las Vegas during protests over Floyd’s death.
Federal prosecutors said that the three men, all with U.S. military experience, sought to disrupt a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas on May 30 after preparing Molotov cocktails in glass bottles filled with gasoline.
The three men were all members of the “boogaloo” movement and had joined a Nevada Boogaloo Facebook group, according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court in Nevada.
Members of the boogaloo movement, many of them armed and wearing distinctive Hawaiian shirts, have participated in dozens of protests around the country.
Members often claim that they appear armed in public to underscore their commitment to Second Amendment rights. But online boogaloo discussion groups overflow with racist statements and threats to exploit any unrest to spark a civil war.
The three Nevada residents charged were Stephen Parshall, 35, a Navy veteran; Andrew Lynam, Jr., 23, a current Army reservist; and William Loomis, 40, an Air Force veteran.
They were being held on $1 million bond each, according to court records. No information was immediately available on their lawyers. The three men are accused of plotting to blow up federal and other property, and with possessing unregistered firearms. They also face Nevada terrorism-related charges.
The men initially joined ReOpen Nevada protests in April and May, demanding an early end to the state shutdowns ordered to stop the spread of the coronavirus, according to the criminal complaint. They discussed exploding some kind of device at those protests in order to spark a clash between police and protesters, according to an informant quoted in the complaint, then switched their attention and plot to the Floyd protests.
Federal agents arrested them last Saturday while they were on their way to a march, stopping to use gas from a can to build explosive bottles.
Scenes From Protests in London, San Francisco, Washington
The protests in the United States have resonated with black people in Britain, who say that they, too, are disproportionately subjected to police violence.
Thousands of demonstrators marched across London Wednesday to support protests in the United States.
Large groups of mostly young people gathered in Hyde Park in central London and chanted “No justice, no peace, no racist police” and “the UK is not innocent.”
Joining in the protest was actor John Boyega, known for his role as Finn in the “Star Wars” sequel films, who delivered an emotional speech, referencing people killed by the police.
“Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process,” he said, “We don’t know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don’t know what Sandra Bland could have achieved. But today we’re going to make sure that won’t be an alien thought to our young ones.”
The demonstration continued toward Parliament Square and was mostly peaceful, apart from a brief scuffle between the police and protesters close to Downing Street.
“This is the first time I’ve seen so many different ethnicities come out and stick up for black people,” said Richie Newton a 28-year-old musician, who participated in the Hyde Park gathering. “We have never received so much support.” — CEYLAN YEGINSU
A multiethnic crowd including doctors in scrubs and students wearing black gathered in the Mission District, filling the streets next to Dolores Park.
William Achukwu, at 6 foot 6 inches, towered over his fellow San Franciscans.
“Our Declaration of Independence says life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Achukwu said. “We are only dealing with the life part here,” he said of the protest. “This is a first step. But liberty is what a lot of people are marching for.”
Achukwu said his experiences as a black man in San Francisco, where he works for a technology company, have taught him that even in such a liberal city he is treated with fear.
People clutch their bags when he jogs through his neighborhood. His tenant brought a friend to the house and she thought he was there to clean. A police officer in Silicon Valley stopped him in his red Mustang convertible for drifting across lanes as he turned. The officer said, “Turn off your hip-hop when you’re talking to me.” He was listening to “My Way” by Frank Sinatra.
A number of years ago he traveled to Tokyo and was walking through the streets late at night when he was approached enthusiastically by a child. “A little girl walked right up to me with no fear,” he said. “That’s never happened to me at home. “Why?” — THOMAS FULLER
As the sun started to descend over Washington on Wednesday, a crowd of more than a thousand protesters gathered peacefully. Sandwiches were distributed. An aging white Volvo had cookies in its trunk.
The security perimeter around the White House had grown. No longer were soldiers and police behind a black chain link fence, as on the previous day. Instead the officers and troops had surged forward by half a block, forming a human line of riot shields, helmets and camouflage.
National Guard units, solidly ahead of the police near the White House, had seemingly become the public face of the security presence. They blocked the streets with 2.5 ton Army transport trucks.
Rai Jackson, a 39-year-old Methodist preacher joining the protest for the first time, said he wanted to see the situation before leading prayer next Sunday.
“My heart is broken,” Jackson said. “But at the same time it gives me hope.”
He added that he felt for troops lined up in front of him.
“I imagine that some of them would probably want to kneel with us,” Jackson said. “My heart goes out to everybody who has to be in the middle of this, trying to go home and talk to their family about what side they’re on.”
“My heart breaks for them.” — THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFF

MINNEAPOLIS — In the sea of hundreds of protesters who gathered one evening this week near the intersection where George Floyd was killed, a lone voice rose from the crowd.
“Everybody sit down,” it urgently ordered.
Others chimed in — “Sit down! Sit down!” — scolding those, even journalists, who were slow to comply.
A few minutes later, Tony Clark, wearing a black face mask and an earring with the inscription “Not today Satan,” bounded toward the center of the circle of seated bodies and took the megaphone.
“Everybody stand up,” he commanded, contradicting the earlier speaker’s instructions.
The crowd rose.
“The moment y’all sit down, the moment they’re going to step on y’all,” Clark, 27, said to rousing applause. But a half-hour later, he reversed his stance and told everyone to sit down again.
“Stop barking orders,” said Davi Young, a Marine veteran, twisting his face. “You’re not the police.”
Welcome to 21st-century activism, where spontaneous and leaderless movements have been defined by their organic births and guided on the fly by people whose preferences, motivations and ideas may not always align.
But the absence of organized leadership does not mean the movements — from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter — are rudderless.
Leveraging technology that was unavailable to earlier generations, the activists of today have a digital playbook. Often, it begins with an injustice captured on video and posted to social media. Demonstrations are hastily arranged, hashtags are created and before long, thousands have joined the cause.
At the core is an egalitarian spirit, a belief that everyone has a voice, and that everyone’s voice matters.
“This is much more than an organization. This is much more than an individual,” said Nejah Ibrahim, 26, sitting on the pavement at the intersection where Floyd was arrested, sporadically leading chants or delivering messages from a megaphone.
“This is collective people who came together,” he continued, “to stand against a systematic oppression that we have endured for so long.”
But leaderless movements have their challenges.
It can be difficult to keep protests from spilling out of control, and difficult to maintain a clear and focused message. Disputes over the best strategies can easily emerge.
“I think it is detrimental that we lack that kind of structure, organization,” said Dame Jasmine Hughes, 33, standing at a makeshift memorial for Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pinned Floyd’s neck to the ground with his left knee for nearly nine minutes.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, was fired from the Minneapolis Police Department and charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers at the scene were charged on Wednesday with aiding and abetting the killing.
“Organizations show power,” Hughes continued. “There’s power in clarity. There’s power in structure, especially when people are hurting.”
Though organized structure might be loose, traditional civil rights groups, churches and newly minted activist organizations have provided guidance and tactical and practical support to activists around the country.
Carmen Means, a pastor who has led a mostly online congregation since 2015 and is the director of the Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization in Minneapolis, said her congregants helped set up a memorial for Floyd. They have received food donations and they turned a nearby building into a food bank, where there was recently a long line of residents.
And she has led discussions outside Cup Foods — the corner store near where the fatal encounter between Floyd and the police took place — where people talked about how Floyd’s death has affected them.
“They were weeping,” she said. “You could see the trauma that was in their eyes.”
More than emotional support, Means and her fellow activists also try to help strategize the demonstrators’ next moves.
She said she has convened daily meetings for “strategic thinking, planning because we understand that this is not a sprint. This is a marathon, right?”
Part of that strategy is figuring out how to channel the energy of young activists who are not affiliated with official organizations. They may have raw rage, she said, and need guidance in finding productive ways to express it.
“We do tell them that it is their right to protest and be angry. That’s something courageous,” said Shanene Herbert, a member of Means’ congregation who helps youth in the community.
“But we want them to understand what their rights are,” added Keeya Allen, another congregant. “Understand that they have a life to live. So it’s not about, are you going to die for the cause? Or are you going to live for the cause every day?”
These days, social media is the strongest, most prominent leader. Young activists announce the location of an action or protest on Twitter or Instagram, and within an hour, scores of people are there.
“I think it kind of does make it hard to manage because you don’t know who’s coming,” said Maryan Farasle, a 17-year-old high school senior who lives in the Minneapolis suburbs and is an activist organizer. “You don’t know the people showing up and what their intentions are.”
But at the same time, she added, “I think it is a way to get a lot of people together quickly.”
The young generation of activists also uses social media to police one another and help keep everyone safe. On Thursday night, after protesters set fire to the 3rd Police Precinct headquarters in Minneapolis, one Twitter user warned people to leave the area.
Tensions on the streets in Minneapolis and elsewhere have simmered in recent days, amid a tough law enforcement crackdown and passionate pleas from Floyd’s family to keep the peace.
But today’s young activists also avoid singular leaders. “We’ve seen what happens to people in the past when they’re the lead of anything,” Farasle said, referring to civil rights leaders who have been slain.
Tay Anderson, a 21-year-old organizer in Denver, has found himself facing that danger — and walking a tightrope.
As the protests in Denver tipped into violence and vandalism, he spoke out against looting and rioting while police officers shot projectiles and launched tear gas at the crowd. He once helped negotiate a stand-down with officers to defuse tensions, and some activists accused him of working with the police, he said.
After days of speaking through a megaphone to sign-waving crowds about police killings and systemic racism, Anderson said that chilling online messages forced him to pull back from the crowds on Monday.
He was doing online searches of his name to fact-check news articles that quoted him when Google’s “related searches” showed a disturbing list: “Tay Anderson shot.” “Tay Anderson shot in head.” “Tay Anderson shot in back of head.”
“They can try to silence me but I’m not going to let anybody put a muzzle on me,” he said.
Despite the dangers, some lean into the prospect of being a leader.
“I am a leader,” Clark said this week as he stood among scores of people at the vigil site for Floyd on Minneapolis’ South Side.
Moments later, commotion broke out on the edges of the gathering, an apparent dispute between some of the protesters. Some began to scatter.
“Why are we running?” a man with dreadlocks shouted. “Stand your ground,” a woman with a white cap yelled. Others exhorted: “Stay here! Stay here!”
Things eventually calmed down, until police lights appeared in the distance and protesters rushed toward a makeshift wooden fence they had erected as a barrier to protect their vigil site. “Be peaceful!” protesters shouted. “Don’t instigate!”
Clark sprang into action and urged everyone to stay disciplined.
It turned out to be a false alarm. The police turned around, but Clark worked his way back to the center of the crowd and spoke into the megaphone like a general readying his troops for battle.
Is anyone going home tonight, he asked.
“No!”
And when the tear gas and rubber bullets come, he said, they would need to stand pat.
“Our ancestors have been through worse,” said Clark, a barber who is struggling to find work because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re going to beat this by being in peace tonight.”

WASHINGTON — Even in peaceful times, Washington is situated on a fine line between freedom and order, flexibility and barriers. This city of grand architecture and ever-present security forces conveys an inescapable message: This might be the seat of American liberty, but it is also not a place to be messed with.
The contrast fosters a constant tension in the capital’s governance. How do you police a city of heavily fortified targets without making it feel like a police state? What is the proper balance in a representative democracy?
The question has hung heavy in recent days. Like the country it supposedly answers to, Washington has been on edge, hovered over by low-flying helicopters and patrolled by law enforcement agents from a stew of federal agencies — the FBI, the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Bureau of Prisons and more — dressed in an assortment of uniforms, riot gear and military fatigues.
Nowhere has this tension between autonomy and authority been on more vivid display than in the area around the White House, site of the city’s largest and most intense protests after the death last week of George Floyd, an African American man in Minneapolis held down by a police officer who placed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
By late Wednesday afternoon, many of the streets around the White House were closed off to traffic and, in some cases, secured with newly installed black fencing that gave the area a feel of a caged outcry. Sirens blared from every direction, and helicopters loomed and zigzagged overhead in a signal of the obvious: These are not normal times.
The killing of Floyd has incited days of nationwide outrage and protest over police brutality and racial inequality, as well as intense debate over what is the proper balance between liberty and law enforcement.
The debate is hardly just a matter of legal and legislative abstraction in the local life of Washington. Here, the tension plays out as a continuing and on-the-ground scenario, nowhere more so than in the area around the White House.
“Of course when you live around here, you’re used to seeing a lot of cops,” said Celia Martin, who ventured into the city Wednesday afternoon from Northern Virginia and wore a T-shirt that read, “Roses are red, Doritos are savory, the U.S. prison system is legalized slavery.” She spoke on Connecticut Avenue, a few blocks from the White House.
Recent days have felt deeply uncomfortable to her, Martin said, particularly given the heavily armored gear of many law enforcement officers.
“It has felt superthreatening,” Martin said. “Whenever you see anyone in military gear, it’s like, ‘Why are they here? Who are they protecting?’ ”
Striking the balance between the egalitarian promise of the so-called People’s House and the security demands of the 18.7-acre White House complex has grown increasingly complicated in recent decades. After the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, the Secret Service closed the portion of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House to vehicles. Subsequent years and events — especially the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — have brought an assortment of progressively more restrictive barriers, measures and checkpoints.
The tension exploded into full view of the nation Monday night, when peaceful protesters outside the White House were routed by chemical spray, flash grenades and mounted police so that President Donald Trump could walk across Lafayette Park for a photo op in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, a historic house of worship visited by centuries of presidents.
“Put down your shields!” chanted a crowd Wednesday afternoon arrayed about a dozen feet from a squadron of heavily armored police in black uniforms near the church. It was not immediately clear which forces the officers represented since many were in riot gear with no badges or signifying emblems visible.
It was a tense scene. “Tell us who you are, identify yourselves!” one protester demanded, referring to the mystery of which local or federal entities they worked for.
The officers stood silent in a row.
“Your duty is to protect American citizens,” shouted another protester in the front, Anita Bhatt, of Alexandria, Virginia. It was Bhatt’s first time protesting. Part of her motivation, she said, was “the shock and disgust” she felt witnessing the tactics undertaken by the patrols.
“It seems like we’re on the verge of a dictatorship,” said Bhatt, who came to Washington to attend college 30 years ago and said she was accustomed to living with the region’s heavily guarded presence. The last week, though, has felt jarringly different.
“After 9/11, you would see police and soldiers everywhere,” she said. “But you always had the sense that they were protecting you, that the cops were your friends. Now these same men feel like they’re fighting against us.”
That sentiment was echoed by several demonstrators, some of whom said they only decided to join the protests when they saw what happened Monday night.
Regardless of what brought them here, everyone was aware of the fragile balance of considerations at work.
“You definitely always walk a fine line,” said Robert Apgar, a 13-year veteran of the District of Columbia Transit Police. He was stationed near the entrance to the Farragut North Metro stop at the corner of Connecticut Avenue and K Street. As he spoke, a growing procession of protesters streamed past him toward the White House.
Apgar made it clear that he was speaking for himself, not on behalf of the police force. He held a sign that contained three messages: “End police brutality,” “Blue 4 BLM,” “Be the change.”
“Safety is paramount, but we are dealing with human beings here,” Apgar said. “We ourselves are human beings. And after the events of the last week, it’s clear that America’s children are crying out and demanding to be heard. If police want to survive, we need to heed that call.”

As protests find wide support, states consider reform measures.
The family of George Floyd was preparing on Thursday for the first of a succession of planned memorials in three cities, after a ninth day and night in which tens of thousands of people took to America’s streets in largely peaceful demonstrations calling for sweeping reforms in policing and an end to systemic racism.
Many protesters cheered the decision to charge three more police officers on Wednesday in Floyd’s death and to file a more severe charge against Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground with a knee for nearly 9 minutes as an encouraging development in a broader struggle.
“This is a significant step forward on the road to justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd’s body was laid to rest,” said Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family.
The groundswell of national outrage has already led lawmakers in a number of states to consider legislation aimed at overhauling police procedures and systemic inequities. Measures being weighed include a ban on chokeholds in Colorado, a bill aimed at minimizing the use of lethal force in Wisconsin, and a potential repeal of California’s 24-year-old ban on affirmative action in university admissions and public sector contracting and hiring.
Former President Barack Obama, in rare public remarks, called on every mayor in the country to review use-of-force policies and to aggressively pursue police reforms like mandatory de-escalation of conflicts, a ban on shooting at moving vehicles, timely reporting of violent incidents and prohibitions on some forms of restraint used by the police.
Speaking from his home in Washington, he also offered encouragement to the demonstrators.
“For those who have been talking about protest, just remember that this country was founded on protest — it is called the American Revolution,” Obama said.
His remarks stood in stark contrast to President Donald Trump, whose calls to deploy active-duty military troops to U.S. cities have shaken the Pentagon.
‘He tries to divide us,’ Jim Mattis says of Trump.
Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in his harshest criticism of Trump since resigning in protest in December 2018 over the president’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from eastern Syria, offered a withering take on Wednesday of Trump’s leadership.
“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,” Mattis said in a statement. “Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.”
“When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,” Mattis wrote. “Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens — much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander in chief, with military leadership standing alongside.”
The statement came hours after the current defense secretary, Mark T. Esper, said he did not think the present state of unrest in U.S. cities warranted the deployment of active-duty troops to confront protesters. Esper’s comments contradicted Trump, who has repeatedly raised the possibility of the Insurrection Act to do exactly that.
In a Pentagon news conference on Wednesday, Esper said ordering active-duty troops to police American cities should be a “last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He said that, for now, this was not warranted.
About 1,600 airborne troops and military police have been positioned outside the capital, officials said this week.
Protesters welcome charges against the officers in George Floyd’s death.
From coast to coast, protesters had a consistent reaction to the charges that have now been brought against three additional police officers in the death of Floyd: It’s good news — and it’s not nearly enough. There need to be convictions. There needs to be systemic change.
“I think it’s going to be a really long fight, not just in Minnesota but in cities around the country,” said Izzy Smith, an educator from the South Side of Minneapolis who was among those demonstrating at the site where Floyd was arrested last month.
“This is a marathon, not a sprint,” she added, “so it’s keeping the foot on the gas but keep it steady.”
Nearby, Marquise Bowie said of the charges: “That’s good. It ain’t going to bring the man back, though. It’s a start.”
Some protesters expressed disappointment that the officer who pressed on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, had been charged with second-degree murder rather than first-degree, or that action against the other officers was not taken sooner.
“It’s about damn time,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and protest organizer in Minneapolis. “If not for the outrage that had rocked the country, these officers never would have been charged.”
At a demonstration on the North Side of Chicago, Jonathan Mejias said he was gratified by the news, to a point. “It’s just one piece,” he said. “The world needs to know that it doesn’t end with resolving this one case. There are too many more out there.”
Byron Spencer, handing out water and burgers to protesters outside Los Angeles City Hall, said he was both “elated and defeated” by word of the new charges. He said he had seen countless surges of outrage over police brutality against black men, only to have it happen again.
“I’m 55, I’m black and I’m male. I’ve seen the cycle,” he said. “It’s almost like PTSD constantly having this conversation with my son.”
Cierra Sesay reacted to the charges at a demonstration in the shadow of the State Capitol in Denver. “It’s amazing, it’s another box we can check,” she said. “But it goes up so much higher. It’s about the system.”
In San Francisco, Tevita Tomasi — who is of Polynesian descent and described himself as “dark and tall and big” — said he regularly faced racial profiling. On Wednesday, he distributed bottled water at what he said was his first demonstration but would not be his last. What would stop him from protesting?
“They would have to shoot me.”
Hundreds are expected to gather at a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis.
Hundreds of people were expected on Thursday to attend a memorial service for George Floyd, whose death in police custody in Minneapolis last month has elicited such outrage across the country that it has pushed fears of a pandemic into the background.
“We have to be united, even with COVID,” said Yousif Hussein, 29, who said he planned to attend the memorial.
“I have to show solidarity with George Floyd,” Hussein said outside the corner market in midtown Minneapolis where Floyd made his final gasps — for help, for his mother and for air, a plea that has become a painful refrain for racial and social justice in America: “I can’t breathe.”
Thursday’s memorial service is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. in a large sanctuary at North Central University in Minneapolis. Other services for Floyd are planned for Saturday in Raeford, North Carolina, where some of his family lives, and Monday in Houston, where he lived for many years.
The Minneapolis service, to be led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, comes a day after enhanced charges were announced against the police officer who wedged his knee onto Floyd’s neck and new charges against three other officers who participated in the arrest. All have been fired.
Among those planning to attend the memorial service is Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 when a New York police officer placed him in a fatal chokehold. His last words, “I can’t breathe” — echoed last month by Floyd — galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement.
“It just feels like I’m coming to my son’s funeral again,” Carr said Wednesday.
A friend in Floyd’s passenger seat: ‘He was not resisting in no form or way.’
A longtime friend of George Floyd who was in the passenger seat of Floyd’s car when he was arrested said on Wednesday night that Floyd had tried to defuse the tensions with the police and did not resist.
“He was, from the beginning, trying in his humblest form to show he was not resisting in no form or way,” said Maurice Lester Hall, 42, who was taken into custody in Houston on Monday and interrogated overnight by Minnesota state investigators, according to his lawyer.
“I could hear him pleading, ‘Please, officer, what’s all this for?’” Hall said in an interview with Erica L. Green of The New York Times on Wednesday night.
Hall recounted Floyd’s last moments.
“He was just crying out at that time for anyone to help, because he was dying,” Hall said. “I’m going to always remember seeing the fear in Floyd’s face, because he’s such a king. That’s what sticks with me: seeing a grown man cry, before seeing a grown man die.”
Hall is a key witness in the state’s investigation into the four officers who apprehended Floyd.
Floyd had the coronavirus weeks before his death, an autopsy report shows.
George Floyd had the coronavirus in early April, nearly two months before he died, according to a full autopsy released by the Hennepin County medical examiner on Wednesday.
Dr. Andrew M. Baker, the county’s top medical examiner, said Floyd was probably asymptomatic at the time of his death.
Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who was among two doctors who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family last week, said that the four police officers who arrested Floyd should be tested for the virus, as should some of the witnesses.
“The funeral director wasn’t told, and we weren’t told, and now a lot of people are running around trying to get tested,” Baden said.
He said the full autopsy included information he did not have access to, such as toxicology results showing that Floyd had fentanyl in his system.
Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he was struck by the difference between the county’s official autopsy and the results of Baden’s private autopsy. The county’s report does not refer to any hemorrhaging near the carotid, as the private autopsy did.
Kobilinsky said lawyers for the officers could make a point of the presence of fentanyl in Floyd’s body. Although the amount required to be lethal varies, fentanyl can stop a person’s heart and breathing, he said.
Baden said that the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body was “considerable,” which would be particularly important if he had never used the drug before.
But he said there was nothing in the full autopsy that made him change his medical opinion. “Restraint is what caused the death,” he said.
Three NYPD officers are injured in what the commissioner called a ‘cowardly’ attack.
Hours after the New York City police moved aggressively to enforce an 8 p.m. curfew and crowds of largely peaceful protesters had left the streets, three police officers were wounded late Wednesday night in Brooklyn’s Flatbush neighborhood in what officials called an “despicable” attack.
The police shot the man who the authorities say attacked the officers, including stabbing one in the neck, and all four were being treated for their injuries, according to Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking in the news briefing early Thursday, said he had visited with two of the officers and their family members, and family members of a third injured officer. He called it “a very tough night” and “another example of what it means every day for the men and the women of the NYPD to protect all of us.”
“This is a moment in our history we’ve got to support each other,” he said.
The incident occurred after a day of largely peaceful protests gave way to a tense evening, with the police taking a tough approach to enforcing a curfew for the third night.
“When we have these big crowds — especially in this area, especially where we’ve had the looting — no more tolerance,” Chief Terence A. Monahan told reporters. “They have to be off the street. An 8 o’clock curfew — we gave them to 9 o’clock — and there was no indication that they were going to leave these streets.”
The attack on the officers in Brooklyn was not connected to any demonstration.
“It appears to be a completely, cowardly despicable unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer,” Shea said.
Details are released on the officers charged in George Floyd’s death.
The Minneapolis Police Department late Wednesday released 235 pages of personnel records for the four former officers charged in George Floyd’s killing on May 25, all of whom were fired after video of his death emerged the next day.
Three of the officers, Thomas Lane, 37, J. Alexander Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, were charged on Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, court records show. The fourth officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, who was arrested last week, now faces an increased charge of second-degree murder.
Chauvin appears to have been reprimanded and possibly suspended after a woman complained in 2007 that he needlessly removed her from her car, searched her and put her into the back of a squad car for driving 10 miles an hour over the speed limit.
He was the subject of at least 17 misconduct complaints over two decades, but the woman’s complaint is the only one detailed in 79 pages of his heavily redacted personnel file. The file shows that the complaint was upheld and that Chauvin was issued a letter of reprimand.
“Officer did not have to remove complainant from car, Could’ve conducted interview outside the vehicle,” read the investigators’ finding.
In one part of the records, the discipline imposed is listed as “letter of reprimand,” but Chauvin was also issued a “notice of suspension” in May 2008, just after the investigation into the complaint ended, that lists the same internal affairs case number.
Kueng was an officer with the department for less than six months. He joined as a cadet in February 2019 and became an officer on Dec. 10, 2019, having previously worked as a community service officer with the department. He also worked as a security guard at a Macy’s and stocked shelves at a Target.
Lane was accepted to the police academy in January 2019, having begun working in the criminal justice system in 2017 as a probation officer. Lane previously worked a series of different jobs, from restaurant server to Home Depot sales associate. He volunteered at Ka Joog tutoring, working with Somali youth in Cedar Riverside.
Thao was hired in 2008 as a community service officer in Minneapolis. He was laid off in late 2009 because of budget cuts, but was recalled in 2011 and was then hired as a police officer in 2012.
ACLU challenges a curfew in Southern California.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed an emergency lawsuit on Wednesday over curfews in Southern California, arguing that they are suppressing political protests in violation of the First Amendment.
As thousands of Californians took part in widespread protests after the death of George Floyd, cities including Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Burbank imposed overnight curfews.
The ACLU Foundation of Southern California, which called the restrictions “draconian,” filed its lawsuit on behalf of the Black Lives Matter Los Angeles group, journalists, protesters and other individuals. It listed the Los Angeles police chief and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles among the defendants.
Curfews have been introduced in several U.S. cities, including New York and Washington, in attempts to clamp down on the looting that has followed peaceful daytime protests.
Large numbers of people continue to take to the streets each evening, undeterred by orders to remain inside. Since protests began last week, more than 3,000 people have been arrested in Los Angeles County, most of them accused of curfew violations.

Full text: The organization filed the suit on behalf of a reporter who said he was hit in the face with a projectile shot by the police as he was covering a protest.
Dozens of journalists covering the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality have said they were attacked, arrested, intimidated with weapons or shot with nonlethal projectiles while doing their jobs.
In response, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota on Tuesday filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit accusing a city of abridging the constitutionally mandated freedom of the press.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Jared Goyette, a freelance journalist who has contributed to The Washington Post and The Guardian in recent days, named the City of Minneapolis along with several law enforcement officials as defendants. The A.C.L.U. is seeking class-action status for the suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Minnesota.
The Minneapolis city attorney, Erik Nilsson, said in a statement Wednesday that "we will review the allegations and take them seriously."
"We continue to support the First Amendment rights of everyone in Minneapolis," he added.
According to the complaint, Mr. Goyette was reporting on a protest in south Minneapolis last Wednesday when he was shot in the face with what the suit described as "less-lethal ballistic ammunition." At the time, he was helping an injured person, and there was no warning before the projectile was fired, the suit said. Mr. Goyette was identifiable as a member of the press by a camera attached to a stand and his notepad, the suit said.
"These acts would chill a reasonable person from continuing to engage in a constitutionally protected activity," the lawsuit said. "These acts did, in fact, chill plaintiff and the plaintiff class from continuing to observe and record some events of public interest, including constitutionally protected demonstrations and the conduct of law enforcement officers on duty in a public place."
Minneapolis, the city where George Floyd was killed while in police custody on May 25, has been the site of numerous protests. Many journalists who covered those demonstrations and others around the country told The New York Times that they were targeted by police officers while doing their jobs, even as they wore press badges or informed law enforcement officials that they were journalists.
The A.C.L.U. said this lawsuit would not be the last it would file on behalf of journalists who had been harmed while covering the protests.
"We will not let these official abuses go unanswered," Brian Hauss, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.'s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in a statement. "This is the first of many lawsuits the A.C.L.U. intends to file across the country. Law enforcement officers who target journalists will be held accountable."
Journalists are not immune to crowd-control orders, but the First Amendment is widely recognized to confer protections on the work of public documentation. Many cities, including Minneapolis, have seemingly recognized the special status of journalists by exempting them from the curfews that have gone into effect in recent days.
The A.C.L.U. lawsuit noted other journalists targeted by law enforcement in Minneapolis while covering recent protests, drawn from Twitter posts and news reports.
The defendants in the suit "interfered with the news media's right to cover public events by refusing access to areas where events were unfolding and creating obstacles to the reporters' movement about the city," the lawsuit said. "These incidents constitute flagrant infringements on the constitutional rights of individual reporters, as well as the public's interest in the dissemination of accurate information and accountability of government."
The lawsuit asked for a declaration of constitutional violation and an injunction. It asserted that the defendants had retaliated against Mr. Goyette and other journalists for exercising their First Amendment rights; had unlawfully "seized" Mr. Goyette and others, under the Fourth Amendment, in their attacks; and denied them due process of law.

Full text: The world has been transfixed by the unrest in the United States over police brutality, racism and President Trump's response. Here are snapshots of how people in other countries view what's happening.
A 92-year-old Italian, fondly recalling the G.I.s who parachuted in to liberate his country from fascism, says he now sees the ghost of Mussolini in TV clips from the United States. In Iraq, people are sharing photos that compare President Trump holding up a Bible with Saddam Hussein clutching a Quran. In Mexico, no stranger to mayhem, a 36-year-old author worries about her relatives in New York.
With emotions that range from horror to hope, from schadenfreude to self-reflection, the world has been transfixed by the cascading crises in the United States -- the coronavirus scourge, 40 million suddenly unemployed, the police killings of George Floyd and other African Americans, and President Trump's threats of a military crackdown on protests that have convulsed dozens of cities.
In what amounts to a Dear America letter, people from around world offered The New York Times a taste of how they see what's happening in the United States:
In Italy, birthplace of fascism, a war survivor worries.
The scenes on mobile phones, on televisions and on the front pages have prompted some Italians to reconsider their admiration of America.
Giovanni Marzona was 16 in the summer of 1944 when he saw Americans for the first time, parachuting over the mountains to help liberate Italy from fascism. He said they brought food, weapons "and democracy."
Mr. Marzona, 92, said what he sees now worries him. "We always looked at America as the first defender of freedom," he said. "If they go backward we will all go backward."
He often visits schools to warn students about "the danger of bullies," and the importance of standing up to them. "Now Trump wants to be a bully," he said, "but you have to stop bullies, otherwise they become little Mussolinis."
Alessio Cotroneo, a 24-year-old student from Turin, keeps a poster of the Declaration of Independence by his bed and dreams of working in the United States. But now, he said, "I am seeing a thin vein of authoritarianism." EMMA BUBOLA, ROME
Angered by police violence at home, Kenyans are shocked.
In Kenya, one of the closest American allies in Africa and a country where police brutality has festered, some said the clips of tear-gassed demonstrators and journalists had diminished the moral right of the United States to criticize injustice elsewhere or lecture African nations on human rights.
"There are assumptions that dictatorships only happen in particular places in the world," said Patrick Gathara, a communications specialist in Nairobi. "It's about time we started recognizing and calling out failure even when it happens in the West."
Njeri Wa Migwi, a Kenyan activist raising five children in Nairobi, lived and worked in Boston in 2009. She said the unrest in America had convinced her to never send any of her children to the United States, for fear of a middle-of-the-night phone call that "my child has been killed by police simply because he's black." ABDI LATIF DAHIR, NAIROBI
French march in solidarity, while looking inward at the parallels.
Many interviewed on the streets of Paris said Mr. Floyd's death reinforced their already diminished view of the United States, which has been eroding since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But their message was tempered by France's own problems with racism and police brutality.
"What happened was inhuman," Frederic Kauffmann, a 48-year-old business owner, said of Mr. Floyd's death.
"It shocked me," said Alyssa Mievilly, a 17-year-old hair salon apprentice.
The anti-racism protests in America "speak to us," said Laurence Nardon, the head of the North America program at the French Institute of International Relations, because "there are many parallels that one can draw with what's happening here."
That much was clear on Tuesday evening when 20,000 people converged outside the main courthouse in northern Paris to denounce police violence and racism, defying orders against large assemblies because of the coronavirus.
The protest was meant to honor Adama Traoré, a French black man who died four years ago in police custody. But it also echoed the outcry over Mr. Floyd's death. Hundreds of people waved signs reading "I can't breathe" and "Black Lives Matter," and many protesters said Mr. Floyd's killing had given the movement a new sense of urgency. AURELIEN BREEDEN, CONSTANT MÉHEUT AND THÉOPHILE LARCHER, PARIS
In Mexico, new worries of dangers in the U.S., but admiration for protesters.
Bárbara Arredondo, 36, said she had been apprehensively watching the images of American protests on Instagram feeds from friends around the country and family members in New York.
"It's personally devastating to see that no one is safe on the streets in the United States," said Ms. Arredondo, a writer and entrepreneur based in Mexico City. The past few days she has been kept up at night.
"The language that Trump is using is key to the violence that we are seeing, and is the reason no one is safe," she said.
Ms. Arredondo grew up about three hour's drive from Texas and said she always admired the United States for its values and entrepreneurism. The unrest has only made her respect Americans more.
"So many U.S. citizens, no matter how they identify, are on the streets," Ms. Arredondo said. "They are role models for social transformation." NATALIE KITROEFF, MEXICO CITY
Many Britons of color feel a special affinity for victims of racism in America.
The protests have resonated with black communities in Britain, which say they, too, are disproportionately subjected to police violence and racial injustice.
"The same things happen here, and that's why people in the U.K. have reacted so emotionally," said Nadine Batchelor-Hunt, the former president of Cambridge University's Black and Minority Ethnic Campaign. "The level of violence that we get from the police is not as severe, but the structures that facilitate it are the same."
Thousands of protesters crowded into London's central Hyde Park on Monday in solidarity with American protesters.
"What happened to George Floyd has happened too many times before, but what's been really surprising this time around is that persons actually care," said Richie Newton, 28, a musician who attended the Hyde Park protest. "They are listening, they are reacting, they are saying 'no more' and those messages are rippling through the world."
"This is the first time I've seen so many different ethnicities come out and stick up for black people," he added. "We have never received so much support."
Melanie Bennett, 44, a restaurant manager who studied in Washington in 2013, said she barely recognized the America she had been watching on television. She blamed Mr. Trump.
"What we have seen in the last few days is the consequences of a leader who will just fan the flames and watch the streets burn," she said. "It's appalling and sad." CEYLAN YEGINSU, LONDON
Cheering U.S. protesters, some Iraqis call Trump America's Saddam.
The American protests have struck a nerve in Iraq, where people are paying more attention to the events in Minneapolis and Washington than in their own troubled cities.
"Protests in America have a global impact because people consider that the U.S. is a democratic state applying all human rights conventions," said Sheikh Abdul Jabbar al-Khuzai, who teaches in a Shiite educational institution.
Protesters in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, drew inspiration from the American streets. "These demonstrations have painted a positive and supportive picture for demonstrators and demonstrations around the world that want to fight racism and despotism," said Karrar Muslim, who attended a sit-in on Wednesday in central Basra.
A favorite WhatsApp meme showed a photo of President Trump holding the Bible, paired with a photo of Saddam Hussein holding the Quran at his trial as a way to emphasize his loyalty to Islam.
Soran Tawfiq, 43, a father of four who is a shopkeeper in Sulaimaniyah, in northern Iraq's Kurdistan region, said he sympathized with the American protesters and was shocked by the video of Mr. Floyd's death.
"I wondered: 'Is it true?"' he said. "I mean yes, there are killings in the world every day, but a policeman, who is supposed to be a protector of the law, kills a civilian, and for racial reasons? This is a difficult thing to accept." ALISSA J. RUBIN AND FALIH HASSAN, BAGHDAD, AND KAMIL KAKOL, SULAIMANIYAH.
In Russia, a young follower of the American crisis.
Katya Gazetnikova, 19, a university student majoring in sports management, said she was "very closely" following the protests in America, a subject of fascination among Russia's young.
"I was always interested in what is happening in the United States. It is the main country in the world, all new technologies appear there, most interesting things, too," she said. "What is happening is shaking the foundations in the U.S."
The video of Mr. Floyd's death, she said, was disturbing, "but it doesn't mean that all American policemen are bad. Many of them are also protesting. Many of them are hugging protesters. They support their people." IVAN NECHEPURENKO, MOSCOW
In Germany, even a cynical student is surprised.
Ozge Siteiss, 22, a law student at Berlin's Free University, said she had always considered the United States hypocritical.
"They go around the world promoting democracy and human rights, but can't enforce them at home," she said. "Among my friends, we all understand the anger, because the racism has been systemic, but are wondering, where will this end? It's almost like a civil war."
Still, she said, she was not expecting the scenes of American police brutality.
"I shouldn't be surprised at what is happening, but I am," she said. "It makes me realize how easy it is, even in a Western country, for those in power to turn against their own people." MELISSA EDDY, BERLIN
In India, U.S. unrest strengthens Trump's echo of Modi.
For many Indians watching the protests in America, it's a familiar sight. Just a few months ago, the police in New Delhi were seen thrashing students in videos taken at a predominantly Muslim university as India, the world's largest democracy, convulsed in protest over a divisive citizenship law seen as favoring the Hindu majority.
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government's Hindu-nationalist agenda see many parallels between him and Mr. Trump.
Ramachandra Guha, a pre-eminent biographer of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was arrested last year during a peaceful demonstration, saw especially clear similarities in their penchant for polarizing photo-ops.
Just as Mr. Trump held up a Bible at a Washington church, Mr. Modi posed in a saffron robe last year at a Hindu shrine deep in the Himalayas.
Both moments had a "subliminal appeal," said Mr. Guha. "Modi saying I am a true Hindu and Trump's appeal to his Bible belt." KARAN SINGH, NEW DELHI

Dozens of American cities remained under curfew Wednesday night, but some began to relax their restrictions amid signs of a reduction in the widespread violence, vandalism and civil unrest that broke out across the country following the death of George Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Protests continued during the day and were largely peaceful, reinforcing hopes that the most serious convulsions had passed, especially after three more officers were charged in the death of Floyd. But each day since the turmoil began, serious trouble has not emerged until nighttime, leaving local and state officials again bracing for renewed disturbances as evening approached.
The unrest was far less destructive Tuesday than it had been the previous few nights, as both law enforcement officers and people in the streets appeared less eager for confrontation.
“The largest group of protesters that we have seen to this point have been doing a little bit of self-policing,” Peter Newsham, the police chief of Washington, D.C., said.
Floyd, 46, a black resident of a Minneapolis suburb, died after gasping “I can’t breathe” while a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer was charged Friday with third-degree murder, but on Wednesday, Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, filed a more severe charge, second-degree murder, and also charged the three other officers who were involved in the arrest.
“His life had value,” Ellison said of Floyd. “We will seek justice for him and for you, and we will find it.”
While some cities and states eased their curfews, others kept them in place.
— Los Angeles County and the city of Los Angeles pushed back their curfews from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., and neighboring Santa Monica moved its curfew from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. “We saw mass amounts of people protesting peacefully” last night, the county’s sheriff, Alex Villanueva said. “As a result, hopefully we can start altering the curfew.”
— Washington moved back its curfew from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. In the afternoon, several hundred protesters lay face down on the pavement, as Floyd had, in eerie silence outside the Capitol.
— The mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, maintained a 9 p.m. curfew but reopened street access to the downtown area and allowed businesses there to reopen. The regional commuter rail system resumed service after being shut down for two days.
— New York City, where there was extensive looting Monday night, remained under an 8 p.m. curfew, a day after thousands of peaceful protesters defied it.
— The mayor of Raleigh, North Carolina, Mary-Ann Baldwin, extended an 8 p.m. curfew, despite a quieter night Tuesday, calling the decision “incredibly difficult.”
— Minnesota’s governor kept in place a 10 p.m. curfew in St. Paul and Minneapolis, where a memorial service for Floyd will be held Thursday.
— Atlanta not only maintained its 9 p.m. curfew, but announced that it would begin an hour earlier Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Minnesota’s attorney general asked for patience and time to build the case.
Ellison asked the public Wednesday for patience during a criminal investigation that would take months to complete, and he cautioned that history showed the challenges of prosecuting police officers.
“Trying this case will not be an easy thing,” he said. “Winning a conviction will be hard.”
He also called on protesters to continue peaceful demonstrations and to work toward more lasting change.
“The very fact we have filed these charges means we have believed in them,” Ellison said. “But what I do not believe is that one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel.”
Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, including for 2 minutes 53 seconds after Floyd fell unresponsive, according to the initial charging document released by prosecutors.
The other officers did not stop Chauvin, and Lane and Kueng helped hold Floyd to the ground for at least part of the time, while Thao stood nearby, according to video reconstruction of the arrest by The New York Times. Lane asked at one point whether they should turn Floyd onto his side, prosecutors said, but Chauvin said “no, staying put where we got him.”
At first, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder, a charge that Floyd’s family had criticized as too lenient. He was also charged with second-degree manslaughter. Ellison announced an addition of second-degree murder Wednesday.
In Minnesota, second-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove either that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, or that he did so while committing another felony. A court filing indicated that prosecutors planned to take the latter approach. The maximum penalty is 40 years in prison.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.”
Under Minnesota law, second-degree murder comes with a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and accomplices can be eligible for the same penalties as the primary defendant.
But if they are convicted, it is likely that the officers could get far less than that, under standard sentencing guidelines that suggest the equivalent of 12 years in prison for the typical second-degree murder case, said Richard Frase, a professor of criminal law at the University of Minnesota.
“The statutory maximum is designed for the worst possible case,” he said, adding that judges have substantial latitude in sentencing depending on the facts of the case. “There is obviously a lot of pressure to really be tough on these officers, but this case isn’t going to be sentenced probably for two years.”

Louisville’s mayor orders an outside review of city police
The city of Louisville, Kentucky, will hire an outside consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of its police department, after the recent fatal shootings of two black residents — Breonna Taylor in March and David McAtee early Monday.
Mayor Greg Fischer, who announced the review in a news conference Wednesday, said the consultant would be asked to examine the Louisville Metro Police Department’s policies on training, use of force and bias, among other matters, and that the review would include listening sessions with residents. The mayor called the review “an exciting moment of opportunity for our police department and the city.”
The announcement came as the city is searching for a new police chief. Fischer fired the previous chief, Steven Conrad, on Tuesday after learning that officers did not have their body cameras turned on when McAtee was killed Monday. Conrad was due to retire in a few weeks.
McAtee, who was 53, owned a popular barbecue restaurant where a crowd had gathered outside Sunday night, after the city’s 9 p.m. curfew. Shortly past midnight, two Louisville police officers and two National Guard members on the scene heard gunshots and fired their guns, and McAtee was killed.
Taylor, who was 26, was killed in March when the police executed a “no-knock” search warrant at her home. Outrage over her death has helped to fuel six days of protests in the city. At a demonstration last Thursday, seven people were struck by gunfire.
States begin to weigh new checks on the police
The national response to the death of George Floyd has begun to move from the streets into statehouses, as lawmakers across the country seek to harness outrage at police abuses.
— In California, lawmakers advanced legislation Wednesday to reconsider the state’s landmark ban on affirmative action and to examine reparations for slavery.
— Democrats in Colorado introduced a bill to extend a ban on chokeholds and to permanently decertify and end immunity from prosecution for law enforcement officers convicted of unlawful use of force.
— Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin urged passage of legislation aimed at minimizing the use of lethal police force.
— New Jersey’s attorney general said the state would update its use-of-force guidelines for the first time in two decades.
— In Maryland, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers last week announced a police reform working group.
— After receiving thousands of complaints about the police’s tactics used in recent days, Seattle has decided to drop its effort to remove federal oversight of its police department, which has been in place since 2012.
Whether the efforts will succeed, or curb the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement, is unclear. Nearly half the states passed some form of legislation after the 2014 deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York, and 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland. But only about a third have specifically tightened restrictions on the use of lethal police force, according to The Associated Press. Such changes have been resisted by police organizations.
Dominated by Democrats, California has mounted one of the more aggressive policy responses to Floyd’s death. This week, Bay Area district attorneys asked the state to bar local prosecutors, who handle complaints of police misconduct, from taking campaign contributions from police unions, and the San Francisco public defender called for an overhaul of use-of-force policies in that city.
San Diego’s police chief announced that the department will no longer use the neck restraint employed on Floyd, a technique that has long been restricted in many departments nationally.
California’s measures on reparations and affirmative action will be heard later this week by the state’s Assembly. If passed, the affirmative action proposal would go to the state’s voters on the November ballot, giving them a chance to repeal a 1996 initiative that bans public institutions from offering preferential treatment in education, contracting or employment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.
Scenes From Protests in London, San Francisco, Washington
The protests in the United States have resonated with black people in Britain, who say that they, too, are disproportionately subjected to police violence.
Thousands of demonstrators marched across London Wednesday to support protests in the United States.
Large groups of mostly young people gathered in Hyde Park in central London and chanted “No justice, no peace, no racist police” and “the UK is not innocent.”
Joining in the protest was actor John Boyega, known for his role as Finn in the “Star Wars” sequel films, who delivered an emotional speech, referencing people killed by the police.
“Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process,” he said, “We don’t know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don’t know what Sandra Bland could have achieved. But today we’re going to make sure that won’t be an alien thought to our young ones.”
The demonstration continued toward Parliament Square and was mostly peaceful, apart from a brief scuffle between the police and protesters close to Downing Street.
“This is the first time I’ve seen so many different ethnicities come out and stick up for black people,” said Richie Newton a 28-year-old musician, who participated in the Hyde Park gathering. “We have never received so much support.” — CEYLAN YEGINSU
A multiethnic crowd including doctors in scrubs and students wearing black gathered in the Mission District, filling the streets next to Dolores Park.
William Achukwu, at 6 foot 6 inches, towered over his fellow San Franciscans.
“Our Declaration of Independence says life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Achukwu said. “We are only dealing with the life part here,” he said of the protest. “This is a first step. But liberty is what a lot of people are marching for.”
Achukwu said his experiences as a black man in San Francisco, where he works for a technology company, have taught him that even in such a liberal city he is treated with fear.
People clutch their bags when he jogs through his neighborhood. His tenant brought a friend to the house and she thought he was there to clean. A police officer in Silicon Valley stopped him in his red Mustang convertible for drifting across lanes as he turned. The officer said, “Turn off your hip-hop when you’re talking to me.” He was listening to “My Way” by Frank Sinatra.
A number of years ago he traveled to Tokyo and was walking through the streets late at night when he was approached enthusiastically by a child. “A little girl walked right up to me with no fear,” he said. “That’s never happened to me at home. “Why?” — THOMAS FULLER
As the sun started to descend over Washington on Wednesday, a crowd of more than a thousand protesters gathered peacefully. Sandwiches were distributed. An aging white Volvo had cookies in its trunk.
The security perimeter around the White House had grown. No longer were soldiers and police behind a black chain link fence, as on the previous day. Instead the officers and troops had surged forward by half a block, forming a human line of riot shields, helmets and camouflage.
National Guard units, solidly ahead of the police near the White House, had seemingly become the public face of the security presence. They blocked the streets with 2.5 ton Army transport trucks.
Rai Jackson, a 39-year-old Methodist preacher joining the protest for the first time, said he wanted to see the situation before leading prayer next Sunday.
“My heart is broken,” Jackson said. “But at the same time it gives me hope.”
He added that he felt for troops lined up in front of him.
“I imagine that some of them would probably want to kneel with us,” Jackson said. “My heart goes out to everybody who has to be in the middle of this, trying to go home and talk to their family about what side they’re on.”
“My heart breaks for them.” — THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFF

A 92-year-old Italian, fondly recalling the GIs who parachuted in to liberate his country from fascism, says he now sees the ghost of Mussolini in TV clips from the United States. In Iraq, people are sharing photos that compare President Donald Trump holding up a Bible with Saddam Hussein clutching a Quran. In Mexico, no stranger to mayhem, a 36-year-old author worries about her relatives in New York.
With emotions that range from horror to hope, from schadenfreude to self-reflection, the world has been transfixed by the cascading crises in the United States — the coronavirus scourge, 40 million suddenly unemployed, the police killings of George Floyd and other African Americans, and Trump’s threats of a military crackdown on protests that have convulsed dozens of cities.
In what amounts to a Dear America letter, people from around world offered The New York Times a taste of how they see what’s happening in the United States:
In Italy, birthplace of fascism, a war survivor worries.
The scenes on mobile phones, on televisions and on the front pages have prompted some Italians to reconsider their admiration of America.
Giovanni Marzona was 16 in the summer of 1944 when he saw Americans for the first time, parachuting over the mountains to help liberate Italy from fascism. He said they brought food, weapons “and democracy.”
Marzona, 92, said what he sees now worries him. “We always looked at America as the first defender of freedom,” he said. “If they go backward we will all go backward.”
He often visits schools to warn students about “the danger of bullies,” and the importance of standing up to them. “Now Trump wants to be a bully,” he said, “but you have to stop bullies, otherwise they become little Mussolinis.”
Alessio Cotroneo, a 24-year-old student from Turin, keeps a poster of the Declaration of Independence by his bed and dreams of working in the United States. But now, he said, “I am seeing a thin vein of authoritarianism.”
— EMMA BUBOLA, ROME
Angered by police violence at home, Kenyans are shocked.
In Kenya, one of the closest U.S. allies in Africa and a country where police brutality has festered, some said the clips of tear-gassed demonstrators and journalists had diminished the moral right of the United States to criticize injustice elsewhere or lecture African nations on human rights.
“There are assumptions that dictatorships only happen in particular places in the world,” said Patrick Gathara, a communications specialist in Nairobi. “It’s about time we started recognizing and calling out failure even when it happens in the West.”
Njeri Wa Migwi, a Kenyan activist raising five children in Nairobi, lived and worked in Boston in 2009. She said the unrest in America had convinced her to never send any of her children to the United States, for fear of a middle-of-the-night phone call that “my child has been killed by police simply because he’s black.”
— ABDI LATIF DAHIR, NAIROBI
French march in solidarity, while looking inward at the parallels.
Many interviewed on the streets of Paris said Floyd’s death reinforced their already diminished view of the United States, which has been eroding since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But their message was tempered by France’s own problems with racism and police brutality.
“What happened was inhuman,” Frederic Kauffmann, a 48-year-old business owner, said of Floyd’s death.
“It shocked me,” said Alyssa Mievilly, a 17-year-old hair salon apprentice.
The anti-racism protests in America “speak to us,” said Laurence Nardon, the head of the North America program at the French Institute of International Relations, because “there are many parallels that one can draw with what’s happening here.”
That much was clear Tuesday evening when 20,000 people converged outside the main courthouse in northern Paris to denounce police violence and racism, defying orders against large assemblies because of the coronavirus.
The protest was meant to honor Adama Traoré, a French black man who died four years ago in police custody. But it also echoed the outcry over Floyd’s death. Hundreds of people waved signs reading “I can’t breathe” and “Black Lives Matter,” and many protesters said Floyd’s killing had given the movement a new sense of urgency.
— AURELIEN BREEDEN, CONSTANT MÉHEUT AND THÉOPHILE LARCHER, PARIS
In Mexico, new worries of dangers in the U.S., but admiration for protesters.
Barbara Arredondo, 36, said she had been apprehensively watching the images of American protests on Instagram feeds from friends around the country and family members in New York.
“It’s personally devastating to see that no one is safe on the streets in the United States,” said Arredondo, a writer and entrepreneur based in Mexico City. The past few days she has been kept up at night.
“The language that Trump is using is key to the violence that we are seeing, and is the reason no one is safe,” she said.
Arredondo grew up about three hour’s drive from Texas and said she always admired the United States for its values and entrepreneurism. The unrest has only made her respect Americans more.
“So many U.S. citizens, no matter how they identify, are on the streets,” Arredondo said. “They are role models for social transformation.”
— NATALIE KITROEFF, MEXICO CITY
Many Britons of color feel a special affinity for victims of racism in America.
The protests have resonated with black communities in Britain, which say they, too, are disproportionately subjected to police violence and racial injustice.
“The same things happen here, and that’s why people in the U.K. have reacted so emotionally,” said Nadine Batchelor-Hunt, the former president of Cambridge University’s Black and Minority Ethnic Campaign. “The level of violence that we get from the police is not as severe, but the structures that facilitate it are the same.”
Thousands of protesters crowded into London’s central Hyde Park on Monday in solidarity with U.S. protesters.
“What happened to George Floyd has happened too many times before, but what’s been really surprising this time around is that persons actually care,” said Richie Newton, 28, a musician who attended the Hyde Park protest. “They are listening, they are reacting, they are saying ‘no more’ and those messages are rippling through the world.”
“This is the first time I’ve seen so many different ethnicities come out and stick up for black people,” he added. “We have never received so much support.”
Melanie Bennett, 44, a restaurant manager who studied in Washington in 2013, said she barely recognized the America she had been watching on television. She blamed President Donald Trump.
“What we have seen in the last few days is the consequences of a leader who will just fan the flames and watch the streets burn,” she said. “It’s appalling and sad.”
— CEYLAN YEGINSU, LONDON
Cheering U.S. protesters, some Iraqis call Trump America’s Saddam.
The American protests have struck a nerve in Iraq, where people are paying more attention to the events in Minneapolis and Washington than in their own troubled cities.
“Protests in America have a global impact because people consider that the U.S. is a democratic state applying all human rights conventions,” said Abdul Jabbar al-Khuzai, who teaches in a Shiite educational institution.
Protesters in Basra, Iraq’s second-largest city, drew inspiration from the American streets. “These demonstrations have painted a positive and supportive picture for demonstrators and demonstrations around the world that want to fight racism and despotism,” said Karrar Muslim, who attended a sit-in on Wednesday in central Basra.
A favorite WhatsApp meme showed a photo of President Donald Trump holding the Bible, paired with a photo of Saddam Hussein holding the Quran at his trial as a way to emphasize his loyalty to Islam.
Soran Tawfiq, 43, a father of four who is a shopkeeper in Sulaimaniyah, in northern Iraq’s Kurdistan region, said he sympathized with the American protesters and was shocked by the video of Floyd’s death.
“I wondered: ‘Is it true?’” he said. “I mean yes, there are killings in the world every day, but a policeman, who is supposed to be a protector of the law, kills a civilian, and for racial reasons? This is a difficult thing to accept.”
— ALISSA J. RUBIN AND FALIH HASSAN, BAGHDAD, AND KAMIL KAKOL, SULAIMANIYAH.
In Russia, a young follower of the American crisis.
Katya Gazetnikova, 19, a university student majoring in sports management, said she was “very closely” following the protests in America, a subject of fascination among Russia’s young.
“I was always interested in what is happening in the United States. It is the main country in the world, all new technologies appear there, most interesting things, too,” she said. “What is happening is shaking the foundations in the U.S.”
The video of Floyd’s death, she said, was disturbing, “but it doesn’t mean that all American policemen are bad. Many of them are also protesting. Many of them are hugging protesters. They support their people.”
— IVAN NECHEPURENKO, MOSCOW
In Germany, even a cynical student is surprised.
Ozge Siteiss, 22, a law student at Berlin’s Free University, said she had always considered the United States hypocritical.
“They go around the world promoting democracy and human rights, but can’t enforce them at home,” she said. “Among my friends, we all understand the anger, because the racism has been systemic, but are wondering, where will this end? It’s almost like a civil war.”
Still, she said, she was not expecting the scenes of American police brutality.
“I shouldn’t be surprised at what is happening, but I am,” she said. “It makes me realize how easy it is, even in a Western country, for those in power to turn against their own people.”
— MELISSA EDDY, BERLIN
In India, U.S. unrest strengthens Trump’s echo of Modi.
For many Indians watching the protests in America, it’s a familiar sight. Just a few months ago, the police in New Delhi were seen thrashing students in videos taken at a predominantly Muslim university as India, the world’s largest democracy, convulsed in protest over a divisive citizenship law seen as favoring the Hindu majority.
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist, see many parallels between him and Trump.
Ramachandra Guha, a pre-eminent biographer of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was arrested last year during a peaceful demonstration, saw especially clear similarities in their penchant for polarizing photo-ops.
Just as Trump held up a Bible at a Washington church, Modi posed in a saffron robe last year at a Hindu shrine deep in the Himalayas.
Both moments had a “subliminal appeal,” said Guha. “Modi saying I am a true Hindu and Trump’s appeal to his Bible belt.”

It was one small overlooked moment as the streets of America burned.
In downtown Dallas near the convention center, a protester screamed at a dozen uniformed officers. “How do you live with yourself?” the man yelled at them. “How can you work for something you know is wrong?”
Off to the side, standing near the officers, a member of the Dallas Police Department in civilian clothes and wearing a mask to protect herself from the coronavirus was crying.
It is a volatile time to be a police officer in America.
They have been attacked by protesters and they have also attacked protesters, fueling the anger against them. Some have been applauded nationwide after being caught on video shaking hands with demonstrators, hugging them, taking a knee, or marching alongside them to turn tense protests into parades of solidarity. Others have been disciplined, fired or charged after using excessive force on protesters, as their superiors — long criticized for reacting sluggishly, if at all, to misconduct — are now swiftly punishing the kind of heavy-handed tactics that have been commonplace during riots in decades past.
The message from the president is to dominate the streets with force. The message from many of their chiefs and mayors is to tolerate, connect and empathize. The message on the streets, at times, is that they are part of the problem. The message from the news media is watch what you say and do.
All of these messages have collided in real time as police tactics are analyzed and publicized on social media, as the response becomes increasingly federalized and as officers in several cities are pelted with bricks, shot at and rammed by drivers in vehicles.
In St. Louis on Monday night, four officers were struck by gunfire in a shootout between gunmen at a protest and the police. In Las Vegas, an officer was put on life support after he was shot near the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino as police forces tried to disperse crowds that had hit them with bottles and rocks. In Buffalo, New York, the driver of an SUV sped through a line of law enforcement officers in riot gear, injuring two of them in an episode caught on video.
“We feel like we’re pawns in a game right now,” said a supervisor in a police department in the St. Louis region who asked that his name not be used in order to speak frankly about the job. “It’s almost like there’s an agenda and we’re being used on both sides, the left and the right, to further that agenda.”
The supervisor said it felt like a more dangerous time to be an officer than it did during the rioting in 2014 over the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri, a sentiment echoed by other law enforcement officials.
“In 2014, there were threats of violence, people said all kinds of things,” the supervisor said. “I never felt that nervous.”
Much of policing, like much of politics, is local. But the outrage over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis has upended that notion, inciting social unrest and violence that has put urban and suburban police departments across the country on alert. It has been a challenge for officers, at a time when many are also confronting the coronavirus.
“These type of protests take a significant toll on an officer’s mental wellness, and they add so much stress,” said Manny Ramirez, a sergeant with the Fort Worth Police Department and the president of the police officers’ union. “This is Fort Worth, Texas, 1,000 miles away, but yet these officers have become targets for that rage.”
Ramirez, 35, was in a command post on Sunday when protesters began hurling frozen water bottles and rocks at officers. One officer was struck on the elbow with a projectile. Another broke his leg while chasing a looter. “There’s got to be some way to ensure that going forward we can have something constructive come out of this,” he said.
In Beverly Hills, California, on Tuesday, several hundred chanting protesters were being monitored by the city’s police officers, who closed Rodeo Drive and were flanked by reinforcements in SWAT tactical vehicles.
“I’ve gone home once in the last four days,” said a Los Angeles officer watching the crowd months after having the coronavirus. “My girlfriend had to drop off clothes so I could change. It’s been hell, for everybody. Monsters and Red Bull, that’s the only thing that’s keeping me up.”
As the world watches demonstrations unfold on television and social media, both the best and the worst of American law enforcement has been on display.
Protesters, both peaceful and violent, have been bruised and beaten by officers on the front lines. In Denver, a police officer was fired on Tuesday after posting a photo online of three officers in armored tactical gear with the caption, “Let’s start a riot.”
In Austin, Texas, a 20-year-old African American protester was in critical condition after he was shot in the head with a beanbag round fired by a police officer on Sunday. A protester standing next to the man had thrown objects at the police, and in response an officer struck the victim instead. Others hit by similar police-fired rounds include a woman giving medical assistance and a pregnant African American woman.
“I’m crushed,” the Austin police chief, Bryan Manley, said during a news conference Monday. “I’ve cried a few times today.”
At a time when tensions are volatile on the streets, such missteps do more than hurt a department’s image. In Richmond, Virginia, two officers were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries from gunshots. The shooting occurred hours after the Police Department apologized on Twitter to peaceful protesters who were hit with tear gas.
In many ways, the police response to what is happening on the streets illustrates a kind of post-Ferguson era of policing. Officers — not only chiefs but even the rank and file — have embraced the demonstrations and aligned themselves so much with protesters that they march alongside them. In some parts of the country, chiefs have become more politically outspoken and more emotional than they have been in decades.
At a demonstration in Redlands, a Southern California suburb in San Bernardino County, protesters knelt and bowed their heads for an extended moment of silence, to represent the eight minutes and 46 seconds that the Minneapolis officer had his knee on Floyd’s neck. Among those who took a knee was Chris Catren, the Redlands police chief.
“It’s community policing 2.0,” Catren said.
“In policing, you don’t put a toe in the water,” he said. “You either dive in, or you don’t. When incidents like this happen, for officers all the way across the country, it tarnishes all the work that we’ve done and all the trust we’ve built up with our community, and that’s frustrating.”

SAN FRANCISCO — Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, faced fresh criticism Wednesday as nearly three dozen people who worked at the social network in its early years called out his decision to leave President Donald Trump’s aggressive posts on the site unaltered.
The former employees said in an open letter that Zuckerberg’s position was a “betrayal” of Facebook’s ideals and urged him to reconsider it. They included Facebook’s first chief of communications, as well as designers, engineers and policy executives. Some had helped write the social network’s original community guidelines, which govern what can and cannot be posted.
Zuckerberg has been under fire since Twitter added labels to several of Trump’s tweets last week for the first time to indicate they were inaccurate or glorified violence. On Wednesday, Snap, which makes the Snapchat app, said it would stop promoting Trump’s Snapchat account after determining that his public comments off the site could incite violence.
Facebook has taken no action on posts in which Trump made inaccurate statements about mail-in ballots in the November election or his aggressive messages about protesters after the death of George Floyd, an African American man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Zuckerberg has since faced strong internal pushback for the inaction. The dissent has spilled out across internal message boards, with some Facebook employees resigning in protest, while others staged a virtual “walkout” this week and refused to work. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg defended his position, saying Trump’s posts did not violate Facebook’s policies and reiterated that he supported free speech.
Facebook did not immediately have a comment on the new letter.
Read the full text of it below:
______
Facebook’s leadership must reconsider their policies regarding political speech, beginning by fact-checking politicians and explicitly labeling harmful posts.
As early employees on teams across the company, we authored the original Community Standards, contributed code to products that gave voice to people and public figures, and helped to create a company culture around connection and freedom of expression.
We grew up at Facebook, but it is no longer ours.
The Facebook we joined designed products to empower people and policies to protect them. The goal was to allow as much expression as possible unless it would explicitly do harm. We disagreed often, but we all understood that keeping people safe was the right thing to do. Now, it seems, that commitment has changed.
We no longer work at Facebook, but we do not disclaim it. We also no longer recognize it. We remain proud of what we built, grateful for the opportunity, and hopeful for the positive force it can become. But none of that means we have to be quiet. In fact, we have a responsibility to speak up.
Today, Facebook’s leadership interprets freedom of expression to mean that they should do nothing — or very nearly nothing — to interfere in political discourse. They have decided that elected officials should be held to a lower standard than those they govern. One set of rules for you, and another for any politician, from your local mayor to the President of the United States. This exposes two fundamental problems:
First, Facebook’s behavior doesn’t match the stated goal of avoiding any political censorship. Facebook already is acting, as Mark Zuckerberg put it on Friday, as the “arbiter of truth.” It monitors speech all the time when it adds warnings to links, downranks content to reduce its spread, and fact checks political speech from non-politicians.
This is a betrayal of the ideals Facebook claims. The company we joined valued giving individuals a voice as loud as their government’s — protecting the powerless rather than the powerful.
Facebook now turns that goal on its head. It claims that providing warnings about a politician’s speech is inappropriate, but removing content from citizens is acceptable, even if both are saying the same thing. That is not a noble stand for freedom. It is incoherent, and worse, it is cowardly. Facebook should be holding politicians to a higher standard than their constituents.
Second, since Facebook’s inception, researchers have learned a lot more about group psychology and the dynamics of mass persuasion. Thanks to work done by the Dangerous Speech Project and many others, we understand the power words have to increase the likelihood of violence. We know the speech of the powerful matters most of all. It establishes norms, creates a permission structure, and implicitly authorizes violence, all of which is made worse by algorithmic amplification. Facebook’s leadership has spoken with these experts, with advocates, and with organizers, yet they still seem committed to granting the powerful free rein.
So what do we make of this? If all speech by politicians is newsworthy and all newsworthy speech is inviolable, then there is no line the most powerful people in the world cannot cross on the largest platform in the world — or at least none that the platform is willing to enforce.
President Trump’s post on Friday not only threatens violence by the state against its citizens, it also sends a signal to millions who take cues from the President. Facebook’s policy allows that post to stand alone. In an age of live-streamed shootings, Facebook should know the danger of this better than most. Trump’s rhetoric, steeped in the history of American racism, targeted people whom Facebook would not allow to repeat his words back to him.
It is our shared heartbreak that motivates this letter. We are devastated to see something we built and something we believed would make the world a better place lose its way so profoundly. We understand it is hard to answer these questions at scale, but it was also hard to build the platform that created these problems. There is a responsibility to solve them, and solving hard problems is what Facebook is good at.
To current employees who are speaking up: we see you, we support you, and we want to help. We hope you will continue to ask yourselves the question that hangs on posters in each of Facebook’s offices: “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”
To Mark: we know that you think deeply about these issues, but we also know that Facebook must work to regain the public’s trust. Facebook isn’t neutral, and it never has been. Making the world more open and connected, strengthening communities, giving everyone a voice — these are not neutral ideas. Fact-checking is not censorship. Labeling a call to violence is not authoritarianism. Please reconsider your position.
Proceed and be bold.
Sincerely, some of your earliest employees:
Meredith Chin, Adam Conner, Natalie Ponte, Jon Warman, Dave Willner, on behalf of Ezra Callahan, Chris Putnam, Bob Trahan, Natalie Trahan, Ben Blumenrose, Jocelyn Blumenrose, Bobby Goodlatte, Simon Axten, Brandee Barker, Doug Fraser, Krista Kobeski, Warren Hanes, Caitlin O’Farrell Gallagher, Jake Brill, Carolyn Abram, Jamie Patterson, Abdus-Salam DeVaul, Scott Fortin, Bobby Kellogg, Tanja Balde, Alex Vichinsky, Matt Fernandez, Elizabeth Linder, Mike Ferrier, Jamie Patterson, Brian Sutorius, Amy Karasavas, Kathleen Estreich, Claudia Park

Minnesota officials charged three more former police officers on Wednesday in the death of George Floyd, and added a higher charge to those already lodged against the former officer who held his knee to Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, announced the charges at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
The three, Thomas Lane, 37, J. Alexander Kueng, 26, and Tou Thao, 34, were charged with aiding and abetting murder, court records show. Kueng was in custody Wednesday, county jail records showed. The authorities said they were in the process of arresting Lane and Thao.
The fourth, Derek Chauvin, 44, who was arrested last week, faces an increased charge of second-degree murder.
“This is a bittersweet moment,” Ben Crump, a lawyer for Floyd’s family, said in a statement. “This is a significant step forward on the road toward justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd’s body was laid to rest. That is a source of peace for George’s family in this painful time.”
All four officers were quickly fired from the Minneapolis Police Department after video of the fatal encounter emerged. Prosecutors faced growing calls for charges against all four officers, as anger and anguish over Floyd’s death sent demonstrators into the streets in cities and towns across the country over the past week.
Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said that the new charges “are a meaningful step toward justice for George Floyd.” But he added, “We must also recognize that the anguish driving protests around the world is about more than one tragic incident.”
Thao had faced six prior misconduct complaints in his career with the Minneapolis Police Department. He also was the subject of a lawsuit that claimed he and another officer punched, kicked and kneed an African American man, leaving the man with broken teeth and bruises. A lawyer involved in the case said that the city settled the case by agreeing to pay $25,000.
Chauvin had faced at least 17 misconduct complaints over nearly two decades with the department.
Neither Lane nor Kueng had prior misconduct complaints filed against them, according to the police department.
Minnesota’s attorney general asked for patience and time to build the case.
Ellison asked the public Wednesday for patience during a criminal investigation that would take months to complete, and he cautioned that history showed the challenges of prosecuting police officers.
“Trying this case will not be an easy thing,” he said. “Winning a conviction will be hard.”
He also called on protesters to continue peaceful demonstrations and to work toward more lasting change.
“The very fact we have filed these charges means we have believed in them,” Ellison said. “But what I do not believe is that one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel.”
Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, including for 2 minutes 53 seconds after Floyd fell unresponsive, according to the initial charging document released by prosecutors.
The other officers did not stop Chauvin, and Lane and Kueng helped hold Floyd to the ground for at least part of the time, while Thao stood nearby, according to video reconstruction of the arrest by The New York Times. Lane asked at one point whether they should turn Floyd onto his side, prosecutors said, but Chauvin said “no, staying put where we got him.”
At first, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder, a charge that Floyd’s family had criticized as too lenient. He was also charged with second-degree manslaughter. Ellison announced an addition of second-degree murder Wednesday.
In Minnesota, second-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove either that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, or that he did so while committing another felony. A court filing indicated that prosecutors planned to take the latter approach. The maximum penalty is 40 years in prison.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.”
Public and private autopsies separately found that Floyd’s death was a homicide, but differed in their assessments of whether pressure by the police officers was a causal or contributing factor.
The private autopsy conducted by doctors hired by Floyd’s family determined that he died not just because of the knee on his neck, but also because two other officers applied pressure on his back. The cause of death was listed as mechanical asphyxia.
The Hennepin County medical examiner also found that the manner of death was homicide, but said that Floyd, who had heart conditions, went into cardiac arrest while being restrained by law enforcement. The one-page summary also noted that Floyd was intoxicated with fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamines.
The defense secretary says he does not want active-duty troops used on the streets for now.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Wednesday that he does not think the current state of unrest in American cities warrants the deployment of active-duty troops to confront protesters, just days after President Donald Trump said he was considering use of the Insurrection Act to do exactly that.
In a Pentagon news conference, Esper said ordering active-duty troops to police American cities should be a “last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He said that, for now, this was not warranted.
About 1,600 airborne troops and military police have been ordered to be positioned outside the capital, officials said Tuesday night.
To date, the troops that have assisted with protest response around the country have been National Guard forces under state control, and not active-duty military forces, which are prohibited from carrying out domestic law enforcement under most circumstances. On Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida offered to send 500 Florida National Guard troops to Washington.
Officials said that Trump had discussed the invoking the Insurrection Act to permit use of active-duty troops, but had been dissuaded by Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Attorney General William P. Barr.
Esper also acknowledged on Wednesday that he did know beforehand that he was accompanying Trump to St. John’s Church in Washington on Monday evening, changing his initial assertions that he was unaware of his destination when he joined the president for a walk across Lafayette Square for a photo op after authorities tear-gassed protesters to clear the way.
Esper said after the much-criticized photo op that he was unaware of his destination when he set out with Trump for what he thought was a visit to view troops near Lafayette Square.
“I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News in an interview Tuesday. “I wanted to see how much damage actually happened.”
His comments on Wednesday were widely interpreted as an effort to distance himself from Monday night’s events, which spurred harsh criticism from former senior military officials.
Peaceful protesters defied curfews, but minimal mayhem was reported overnight.
For an eighth day and night, tens of thousands of people staged peaceful protests and impassioned marches across the United States, while the widespread destruction and looting that had followed demonstrations in recent days was largely absent.
Trump called on states to bring in the military to restore order and combat “lowlifes and losers,” as an infantry battalion from Fort Bragg was dispatched to the nation’s capital, where more than 1,000 people gathered outside the White House and military vehicles could be seen on the streets. But governors resisted the president’s entreaties, instead bolstering the police presence, changing tactics and imposing curfews to prevent people from using the protests as cover to wreak mayhem.
While demonstrators in many cities defied curfews, they did so peacefully.
They sang “We Shall Overcome” at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and a large crowd tried to cross over the Manhattan bridge in defiance of a curfew. Outside Wrigley Field in Chicago, crowds chanted “Hands up” as they raised their arms to the sky. In Los Angeles, even as hundreds were arrested throughout the city, a crowd gathered outside the home of Mayor Eric Garcetti, who earlier in the day had joined the crowds and taken a knee as he listened to pleas. On a bridge in Portland, Oregon, hundreds lay face down, hands behind their backs, for a “die in” intended to emulate the death of George Floyd.
Floyd, a 46-year-old black security guard, died after his neck was pinned under a white police officer’s knee for nearly 9 minutes in Minneapolis last week. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The killing, captured on video, was the spark for the outpouring of anger and anguish expressed in demonstrations in more than 140 cities for more than a week.
As the sustained protests have made clear, the fuse has been burning for a long time, and despair had mounted with each case of a black person dying at the hands of the police.
A week after Floyd’s death, Minnesota said it had started a human rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, citing evidence of systematic discrimination against people of color, particularly African Americans.
The Floyd family gathered in Houston on Tuesday for a memorial and were joined by about 60,000 people, according to city officials.
Speakers offered emotional testimonials to a man they recalled as a “gentle giant.” A video of Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, taking in the outpouring of support was shared widely around the country.
“Daddy changed the world,” she said.
Louisville’s mayor orders an outside review of city police
The city of Louisville, Kentucky, will hire an outside consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of its police department, after the recent fatal shootings of two black residents — Breonna Taylor in March and David McAtee early Monday.
Mayor Greg Fischer, who announced the review in a news conference Wednesday, said the consultant would be asked to examine the Louisville Metro Police Department’s policies on training, use of force and bias, among other matters, and that the review would include listening sessions with residents. The mayor called the review “an exciting moment of opportunity for our police department and the city.”
The announcement came as the city is searching for a new police chief. Fischer fired the previous chief, Steven Conrad, on Tuesday after learning that officers did not have their body cameras turned on when McAtee was killed Monday. Conrad was due to retire in a few weeks.
McAtee, who was 53, owned a popular barbecue restaurant where a crowd had gathered outside Sunday night, after the city’s 9 p.m. curfew. Shortly past midnight, two Louisville police officers and two National Guard members on the scene heard gunshots and fired their guns, and McAtee was killed.
Taylor, who was 26, was killed in March when the police executed a “no-knock” search warrant at her home. Outrage over her death has helped to fuel six days of protests in the city. At a demonstration last Thursday, seven people were struck by gunfire.

WASHINGTON — In a rare break with President Donald Trump, multiple Senate Republicans on Tuesday faulted his response to civil unrest around the nation, rejecting his move to crack down on demonstrators and rushing to express sympathy with black Americans who have taken to the streets to protest police brutality against them.
The day after Trump threatened to unleash the U.S. military to rout protesters around the nation, the reactions of Republicans — some condemning the president directly, others carefully suggesting that they held a different view — underscored the politically precarious choice they face between endorsing the president’s divisive approach or breaking with him and risking a party backlash just months before the November elections.
“There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property and no right to throw rocks at police,” Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the word of God as a political prop.”
Sasse was referring to the remarkable spectacle that unfolded Monday evening when police fired flash-bang explosive devices and a chemical agent and used officers on horseback to drive away peaceful protesters outside the White House. Minutes later, Trump strode out and marched across Lafayette Square to brandish a bible outside St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been damaged in a fire during unrest the night before.
Sasse’s comments echoed those of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, who denounced the move in unequivocal terms during an event hosted by Politico.
“If your question is, ‘Should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo op?’ the answer is no,” Scott said.
Those rebukes, and much harsher criticism of the president’s actions by Democrats in the House and Senate, reflected a rising sense of alarm at Trump’s behavior as protests of police violence and racial discrimination reached a boiling point after the death of an African American man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.
With Democrats demanding a legislative response to the issues underlying Floyd’s death, Republicans are facing increasing pressure to back up their critical statements against the president and expressions of concern about persistent racism with something tangible.
“We are going to propose and push for bold action,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday. “What matters is that we respond to a national wave of unrest with action.”
This was hardly the first time Republicans on Capitol Hill found themselves pressed to distinguish between their views and those of a president who in times of trouble often seeks the affirmation of his most conservative supporters.
From the moment he took office, Republicans have been called upon to respond to the president’s loaded statements, hyperbolic tweets and scathing criticisms of others as well as his dealings with foreign governments and his positions on harsh immigration measures, trade, congressional authority and other matters. Most Republicans have typically demurred, not wanting to provoke a caustic Twitter attack from the president or alienate party voters devoted to Trump.
But the current situation may be the most volatile for Republicans yet, with Americans — already enduring the twin public health and economic calamities of the coronavirus pandemic — almost uniformly outraged at the case of Floyd, whose brutal death after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes was captured on video. Many Americans in both parties are increasingly unsettled by both the violence stemming from the protests and Trump’s demands that governors and local authorities take a harder line.
With their hold on the Senate to be decided in an election five months away, Republicans will need the votes of suburban and independent voters if they hope to retain seats in states such as Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina and Maine. In a sign of how lawmakers view the political landscape, moderate Democrats in conservative-leaning districts emphatically rejected Trump’s response to the protests in Washington, suggesting that they see little sympathy for the president’s approach among their constituents.
Despite Trump anointing himself “your president of law and order,” many Senate Republicans have adopted a much less bellicose attitude, emphasizing the need to get at the root causes of the upheaval — racial discrimination and a well-established pattern of excessive use of force by the police — rather than targeting protesters.
“You can understand the outrage,” Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, said Tuesday about the national anguish over Floyd’s killing. McConnell, whose hometown, Louisville, was in turmoil over Floyd’s death and recent episodes involving police in Kentucky, said the grievances were legitimate and he did not dispute the role racism played in the events.
“There is no question that there is residual racism in America,” he told reporters. “No question about that. It has been a longtime dilemma, and we all wish we could get to a better place.”
But when Schumer tried to force action on a symbolic resolution to condemn both the violence and Trump’s actions, McConnell objected, chiding Democrats for pushing a measure that he said addressed neither justice for black Americans nor “peace for our country in the face of looting.”
“Instead, it just indulges in the myopic obsession with President Trump that has come to define the Democratic side,” McConnell said.
Still, other Republicans joined in the criticism of Trump.
“To me at a time like this, the president ought to be trying to calm the nation,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is facing a difficult reelection race in a state Trump plans to visit this week. She said she found it “painful” to watch peaceful protesters subjected to tear gas so he could go to a church he had visited just once before, and added that Trump “came across as unsympathetic and as insensitive to the rights of people to peacefully protest.”
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told reporters that Monday’s events did not reflect “the America that I know.”
“I don’t think militarization is the answer to the anxiety, the fear, the distrust, the oppression we feel right now,” Murkowski said. “It is not the response.”
Even Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s chief Republican defenders, said he had been flummoxed by the president’s actions.
“I don’t know what the purpose of the trip was,” Graham said. “I do know that last night was a bad night and we need less bad nights.”
Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, the lone black Republican in the House, joined a peaceful protest in Houston on Tuesday evening, marching alongside his constituents and Floyd’s family.
“What we are showing you today in Houston is that we can be outraged by a black man getting murdered in police custody,” Hurd, who is retiring, said in a video on Twitter. “We can be united for change in our society, and we can be thankful that law enforcement is enabling our First Amendment rights.”
Other Republicans fell back on their practiced defense, saying they could not make a judgment because they had not seen the incident, while others defended the president, noting that some of the protests had grown violent and given way to looting.
“We have to restore order,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “This can’t go on. So hopefully, you know, the president talking that way will put a little spine in some of these governors that aren’t calling out the National Guard, to the extent that they need to to restore order.”
Johnson claimed not to have seen protesters being violently driven back so that Trump could walk to the church, and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said the episode had been “in the eye of the beholder.”
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, commended Trump, saying, “I’m glad the president led by going to St. John’s Church.” It was the protesters, not the president, who had abused power, Cruz said.
Democrats moved quickly to try to take political advantage of the public mood.
“It’s time for John Katko to find the backbone to state clearly whether he stands with President Trump or the clergy denouncing his tear gassing of Americans peacefully protesting,” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a statement, singling out a third-term moderate Republican from New York who is facing a difficult reelection race in a district Hillary Clinton won in 2016. The committee sent out identical statements about roughly a dozen other endangered House Republicans.
Democrats said they were skeptical that Republicans would be willing to challenge Trump too aggressively. They said they suspected Republicans would treat the issue as they had gun control in the past, promising action immediately after mass killings but letting the issue pass quietly without action once the uproar subsided.
But Democrats made clear that they did not intend to let the issue go.
“I’ve heard words from people on both sides of the aisle, speaking toward the injustice of racism that exists in our country — I’ve heard words,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in a passionate floor speech. “It’s on us in this body to do something.”

The defense secretary says he does not want active-duty troops used on the streets for now.
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Wednesday that he does not think the current state of unrest in American cities warrants the deployment of active-duty troops to confront protesters, just days after President Donald Trump said he was considering use of the Insurrection Act to do exactly that.
In a Pentagon news conference, Esper said ordering active-duty troops to police American cities should be a “last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” He said that, for now, this was not warranted.
About 1,600 airborne troops and military police have been ordered to be positioned outside the capital, officials said Tuesday night.
Officials said that Trump had discussed the invoking the Insurrection Act but had been dissuaded by Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Attorney General William P. Barr.
Esper also acknowledged on Wednesday that he did know beforehand that he was accompanying Trump to St. John’s Church in Washington on Monday evening, changing his initial assertions that he was unaware of his destination when he joined the president for a walk across Lafayette Square for a photo op after authorities tear-gassed protesters to clear the way.
Esper said after the much-criticized photo op that he was unaware of his destination when he set out with Trump for what he thought was a visit to view troops near Lafayette Square.
“I didn’t know where I was going,” Esper told NBC News in an interview Tuesday. “I wanted to see how much damage actually happened.”
His comments on Wednesday were widely interpreted as an effort to distance himself from Monday night’s events, which spurred harsh criticism from former senior military officials.
Peaceful protesters defied curfews, but minimal mayhem was reported overnight.
For an eighth day and night, tens of thousands of people staged peaceful protests and impassioned marches across the United States, while the widespread destruction and looting that had followed demonstrations in recent days was largely absent.
Trump called on states to bring in the military to restore order and combat “lowlifes and losers,” as an infantry battalion from Fort Bragg was dispatched to the nation’s capital as part of a broader show of force. But governors resisted the president’s entreaties, instead bolstering the police presence, changing tactics and imposing curfews to prevent people from using the protests as cover to wreak mayhem.
While demonstrators in many cities defied curfews, they did so peacefully.
They sang “We Shall Overcome” at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn, New York. Outside Wrigley Field in Chicago, crowds chanted “Hands up” as they raised their arms to the sky. In Los Angeles, hundreds gathered outside the home of Mayor Eric Garcetti, who earlier in the day had joined the crowds and taken a knee as he listened to pleas. On a bridge in Portland, Oregon, hundreds lay face down, hands behind their backs, for a “die in” intended to emulate the death of George Floyd.
Floyd, a 46-year-old black security guard, died after his neck was pinned under a white police officer’s knee for nearly 9 minutes in Minneapolis last week. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The killing, captured on video, was the spark for the outpouring of anger and anguish expressed in demonstrations in more than 140 cities for more than a week.
As the sustained protests have made clear, the fuse has been burning for a long time, and despair had mounted with each case of a black person dying at the hands of the police.
A week after Floyd’s death, Minnesota said it had started a human rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, citing evidence of systematic discrimination against people of color, particularly African Americans.
The Floyd family gathered in Houston on Tuesday for a memorial and were joined by about 60,000 people, according to city officials.
Speakers offered emotional testimonials to a man they recalled as a “gentle giant.” A video of Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter, Gianna, taking in the outpouring of support was shared widely around the country.
“Daddy changed the world,” she said.
— Washington: More than 1,000 protesters on Tuesday faced off with officers across a newly erected chain-link fence outside the White House, but the demonstrations remained largely peaceful. Dozens of military vehicles were deployed on the capital’s streets.
— New York: Hundreds of demonstrators violated an 8 p.m. curfew in a standoff with the police at the entrance to the Manhattan Bridge. But overall there were fewer violent confrontations between the police and protesters and fewer acts of looting and vandalism than in recent days.
— Atlanta: Police and military personnel used tear gas to disperse a large crowd near Centennial Olympic Park shortly after the city’s 9 p.m. curfew.
— California: The Los Angeles police made hundreds of arrests throughout the city on Tuesday night, a police spokesman said. Santa Monica enacted among the strictest curfews in the nation, starting at 2 p.m. local time.
— Philadelphia: Hundreds of protesters had gathered outside City Hall by Tuesday afternoon, and later tried to pull down a statue of a former Mayor Frank Rizzo, an early proponent of white identity politics. Mayor Jim Kenney said later that the statue had been taken down.
— Charlotte, N.C.: Protesters and the police skirmished after authorities ordered the crowds to disperse. Video showed officers surrounding demonstrators and using stun grenades, pepper spray and pepper pellets, tactics that were criticized by a black state lawmaker who represents Charlotte. The police, who said that they would conduct an internal review of the exchange, said that officers had been hit by bottles and rocks, and that a protester had thrown what they called a chemical agent at an officer on a bicycle. One person who was arrested had a military-style rifle and two 30-round magazines, police said.
— St. Louis: Trump tweeted his condolences to David Dorn, a retired police captain who police said had been shot by a looter on Monday night. Dorn died the same night that four active-duty police officers were shot during protests.
In a New York City under ‘lockdown’ and curfew, mayhem subsides even as protests continue.
New York City, which has essentially been closed for business for more than two months to slow the spread of a coronavirus that has killed tens of thousands of its residents, spent a second night under a new restriction: citywide curfew.
The curfew took effect in New York on Tuesday at 8 p.m. as officials again tried to curb the violent clashes, looting and other destructive acts that had marred the mostly peaceful protests filling the streets for nearly a week.
As happened on Monday, when much of the worst damage was done before an 11 p.m. curfew took effect, groups of people lingered outside after the cutoff came. The largest crowd tried to cross the Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn but was turned back peacefully after a lengthy standoff with the police.
Overall, there appeared to be fewer violent confrontations between officers and protesters than in preceding days and fewer acts of looting than in the two previous nights.
“Very calm situation,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter after 11 p.m. “So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours.”
De Blasio and had been criticized earlier in the day by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and others for how he and the police department had handled what turned into a rash of looting across midtown Manhattan on Monday before the 11 o’clock curfew.
On Tuesday, in the hours after the curfew took effect, the group on the bridge and several other crowds of hundreds of people continued to walk peacefully through Brooklyn and Manhattan, chanting protest slogans and urging change.
“As long as it takes, I’m going to do it,” Sam Fitzgerald, 35, of Brooklyn, said of protesting. “It’s a revolution, baby.”
Combat troops are deployed to the nation’s capital and placed on standby.
Less than two hours before a 7 p.m. curfew went into effect in Washington on Tuesday, military vehicles assumed positions across the city.
A crowd of protesters in Lafayette Square near the White House appeared to be at least twice that of a day earlier.
With the imminent arrival of military units and the use of helicopters to suppress protesters on Monday night — a tactic used for battles with insurgents abroad, now applied on U.S. soil — some in the crowd whispered that more soldiers were on the way.
Alec, a 32-year-old protester who spent two deployments in Afghanistan, said he had seen things over the past two days that he never expected to see in his own country.
“There are real problems here,” he said, declining to give his last name because he works for the government, “and no amount of uniforms or soldiers are going to fix them.”
While the evening ended with only flashes of confrontations, the city’s downtown is being flooded with agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, Customs and Border Protection, and several other agencies, along with the military. Transportation Security Administration officers have also been called out of airports to help protect federal property.
The militarization of the response to the protest has stirred deep concerns and drawn widespread criticism, including from retired Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said that “our fellow citizens are not the enemy, and must never become so.”
“I am deeply worried that as they execute their orders, the members of our military will be co-opted for political purposes,” he wrote in an opinion piece in The Atlantic published on Tuesday, adding that America’s cities and towns “are not ‘battle spaces’ to be dominated, and must never become so.”
The federal law enforcement response is being run by Attorney General William P. Barr. It was also Barr who ordered federal officers to clear peaceful protesters out of Washington’s Lafayette Park on Monday so that Trump could walk to a historic church and have his picture taken there, according to a Justice Department official.
In all, about 1,600 troops were being moved into the Washington area, according to the Pentagon, which described the troop movements as “a prudent planning measure.”
After a UCLA stadium was used as a ‘field jail,’ for protest arrests, the university says it won’t happen again.
The University of California, Los Angeles says it will not allow a campus stadium to serve as a “field jail” in the future, after faculty members raised concerns about its use to process people arrested over curfew violations this week.
It was not immediately clear how many people were detained at the stadium, which is named after Jackie Robinson. But about 2,500 people were taken into custody in Los Angeles from Friday to Tuesday morning, according to authorities. Scores more were arrested on Tuesday evening.
A group of 16 faculty members raised concerns about the use of the stadium in a letter made public on Tuesday by Ananya Roy, a professor of urban planning at the university.
“Testimony from arrested protesters is chilling,” they wrote. “UCLA students were arrested for engaging in the constitutionally protected right to peacefully protest against racial injustice, which is pervasive in American policing. They were detained and processed at a stadium on their own campus named after Jackie Robinson, an icon of the long and unfinished struggle for black freedom.”
The letter says that social distancing protocols put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic were violated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s department, with officers not wearing masks or following other guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The cruel irony that this took place at a location used as a COVID-19 testing site is not lost on those arrested or on us,” they wrote.
The university issued a statement on Twitter saying that it was troubled by the accounts of how the stadium was being used.
“This was done without UCLA’s knowledge or permission,” it wrote. “As lessee of the stadium, we informed local agencies that UCLA will NOT grant permission should there be a request like this in the future.”
‘We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism,’ Pope Francis says.
Pope Francis said on Wednesday that he was watching the “disturbing social unrest” in the United States with “great concern.”
“We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,” he said during his weekly general audience. He said he was praying for “the repose of the soul of George Floyd and of all those others who have lost their lives as a result of the sin of racism.”
He called for “national reconciliation and peace” and said the recent violence on U.S. streets “self-destructive and self-defeating.”
The pope’s comments came a day after Christian leaders criticized Trump for using two religious sites in Washington for what they said were acts of political theater.
On Monday, Trump posed holding a Bible outside the historic St. John’s Church, and on Tuesday he and the first lady spent about 10 minutes inside the St. John Paul II National Shrine.
“I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles,” Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington said in a statement.
The Rev. Gini Gerbasi, an Episcopal priest who had been on the patio of St. John’s when nearby protesters were sprayed with tear gas, said he was shocked by the events. “They took what literally had been holy ground that day,” he said in an interview, “and turned it into a literal battleground.”
Front-line medical workers clap for ‘front-line’ demonstrators.
For months on end, health care workers across the United States have cared for hundreds of thousands of people sickened by the coronavirus and even lost their own lives to the pandemic. They have also seen the virus infect and kill black people in the country at disproportionately high rates.
And just as New Yorkers have offered their applause in appreciation of those workers each evening, on Tuesday night the tables were turned and it was medical professionals offering their applause in support of the protests that have swept the country.
Dressed in scrubs, lab coats and protective equipment, doctors and medical personnel came out in droves in New York City to show support for the thousands who have taken to the streets in protest to call for an end to systemic racism. Some joined protesters in New York City’s Times Square, while others lined the streets outside hospitals, clapping for protesters as they walked past.
The organizers of a “Front Lines for Front Lines” group wrote on Twitter: “Every night, at 7pm, the city has clapped for us.” On Tuesday, they said, “We’re re-purposing that show of support.”
Elsewhere in the country, medical workers have handed out masks and milk to protesters in Minneapolis to ease the effects of tear gas. And in Washington, D.C., a doctor told a local news outlet that he would be riding a bike around protests in the city to offer first aid.

NEW YORK — Officers responding to a report of gunfire in a Brooklyn housing project Tuesday came across a man pointing a weapon at them from behind a tree on a dark street and shot him several times, killing him, the police said.
The police said the incident was not related to the demonstrations and clashes between protesters and officers that continued to wrack the city Tuesday night in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of a white Minnesota police officer.
The protests over Floyd’s death, and other deaths of black people at the hands of police officers, have heightened tensions between the Police Department and residents of predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods like the one where the shooting occurred.
Officers responded after ShotSpotter sensors detected gunfire around 9:26 p.m., the police said.
When officers arrived, they were told that a man in his 40s had been shot near the entrance of the housing project.
But the officers couldn’t immediately find the wounded man because he had crawled away, a police official said.
Witnesses told the police that a man with a gun had run up the block, Chief Terence Monahan said at a news conference near the scene less two hours after the incident. After a search, the officers came upon the armed man, whom they believed to be the shooter, hiding behind a tree, the chief said.
The man, who was 34 but whose name was not released, pointed his weapon at the responding officers, the police said. For more than a minute, officers ordered the man over and over to drop his weapon in an adrenaline-charged standoff, the chief said.
Videos posted on Facebook and Twitter also showed numerous neighbors behind the officers, warning the man, “Drop the gun!”
Monahan said body cameras recorded the officers yelling, “He’s moving his head. He’s getting up. He’s gonna go, he’s gonna go! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Please drop the gun! Please drop the gun.”
Then there was a deafening volley of fire, an audio recording of which was made by a witness and circulated online. Monahan said 10 officers had fired at the man. He did not immediately know many rounds they had fired or whether the man had fired his pistol. The shooting was also recorded on the officers’ body cameras, the chief said.
“The male refused the orders of the officers, the officers discharged their weapon at the individual and struck him,” Monahan said.
The man collapsed on the spot and died before he could be taken to a hospital, Monahan said. He displayed a photo of the man’s pistol, which investigators believe was obtained illegally.
A puddle of blood on the sidewalk could be seen near a patch of bushes after the shooting.
The police said they did not know what had led to the first shooting. The wounded man who crawled away was discovered nearby and was taken to a hospital, where he remained in stable condition, the police said. No officers were seriously injured, the police said.
Janet Howell, who lives within a block of the scene of the shooting, said she came outside after hearing a half-dozen shots and saw the police carrying a man to a squad car.
“All I heard was shots and then sirens,” she said. Howell said the man appeared to have been shot in the shin; he was limping, supported by officers, and had what appeared to be a tourniquet tied around his thigh.
The police later took the same man to a nearby ambulance, she said. At that point, the police yelled for Howell to get back inside her apartment building, she recalled.
Roy Isaacs, who lives in the same building as Howell, said he came outside after he heard shots and saw the same man with a leg wound lying on the ground in a courtyard of the housing development.
Police screamed that Isaacs should get back inside. “They said they were looking for the shooter,” Isaacs said.
Moments later, he saw the officers crouched behind cars and trucks as if taking cover before a shootout, but he said he didn’t hear any more shots.
Another witness, who did not give his name because he feared for his safety, said he saw officers trying to assist the wounded man just before the gunfire erupted.

ACLU Sues Minneapolis on Behalf of Reporter Hurt by Police at Protest [With graphic(s)]

Dozens of journalists covering the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality have said they were attacked, arrested, intimidated with weapons or shot with nonlethal projectiles while doing their jobs.
In response, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota on Tuesday filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit accusing a city of abridging the constitutionally mandated freedom of the press.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Jared Goyette, a freelance journalist who has contributed to The Washington Post and The Guardian in recent days, named the city of Minneapolis along with several law enforcement officials as defendants. The ACLU is seeking class-action status for the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota.
The city of Minneapolis did not immediately provide a comment.
According to the complaint, Goyette was reporting on a protest in south Minneapolis last week when he was shot in the face with what the suit described as “less-lethal ballistic ammunition.” At the time, he was helping an injured person, and there was no warning before the projectile was fired, the suit said. Goyette was identifiable as a member of the press by a camera attached to a stand and his notepad, the suit said.
“These acts would chill a reasonable person from continuing to engage in a constitutionally protected activity,” the lawsuit said. “These acts did, in fact, chill plaintiff and the plaintiff class from continuing to observe and record some events of public interest, including constitutionally protected demonstrations and the conduct of law enforcement officers on duty in a public place.”
Minneapolis, the city where George Floyd was killed while in police custody May 25, has been the site of numerous protests. Many journalists who covered those demonstrations and others around the country told The New York Times that they were targeted by police officers while doing their jobs, even as they wore press badges or informed law enforcement officials that they were journalists.
The ACLU said this lawsuit would not be the last it would file on behalf of journalists who have been harmed while covering the protests.
“We will not let these official abuses go unanswered,” Brian Hauss, a lawyer with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in a statement. “This is the first of many lawsuits the ACLU intends to file across the country. Law enforcement officers who target journalists will be held accountable.”
Journalists are not immune to crowd-control orders, but the First Amendment is widely recognized to confer protections on the work of public documentation. Many cities, including Minneapolis, have seemingly recognized the special status of journalists by exempting them from the curfews that have gone into effect in recent days.
The ACLU lawsuit noted other journalists targeted by law enforcement in Minneapolis while covering recent protests, drawn from Twitter posts and news reports.
The defendants in the suit “interfered with the news media’s right to cover public events by refusing access to areas where events were unfolding and creating obstacles to the reporters’ movement about the city,” the lawsuit said. “These incidents constitute flagrant infringements on the constitutional rights of individual reporters, as well as the public’s interest in the dissemination of accurate information and accountability of government.”
The lawsuit asked for a declaration of constitutional violation and an injunction. It asserted that the defendants had retaliated against Goyette and other journalists for exercising their First Amendment rights; had unlawfully “seized” Goyette and others, under the Fourth Amendment, in their attacks; and denied them due process of law.

The Corrosive Effects of Tear Gas Could Intensify Coronavirus Pandemic [With graphic(s)]

SEATTLE — The billowing clouds of tear gas that the authorities are sending through protest crowds across the United States may increase the risk that the coronavirus could spread through the gatherings.
Along with the immediate pain that can cause watering eyes and burning throats, tear gas may cause damage to people’s lungs and make them more susceptible to getting a respiratory illness, according to studies on the risks of exposure. The gas can also incite coughing, which can further spread the virus from an infected person.
Sven-Eric Jordt, a researcher at Duke University who has studied the effects of tear gas agents, said he had been shocked to watch how much the authorities had turned to the control method in recent days.
“I’m really concerned that this might catalyze a new wave of COVID-19,” Jordt said. The virus has been linked to more than 106,000 deaths in the United States.
The protests after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis have already raised alarm among health experts who have watched as protesters gathered by the thousands in cities around the country. While some demonstrators have worn masks and gloves, the crowds have often involved shouting and chanting in close quarters — a risky activity for a virus spread by respiratory droplets.
But the addition of wafting gases, which have been used widely by police forces in recent nights, has added an uncertain new element of risk to the scene.
In research conducted by the U.S. Army, examiners looked at the effects of exposure that thousands of Army recruits had to the common riot-control agent known as CS gas or tear gas. The study conducted in the summer of 2012 found that the personnel in a basic training cohort had a substantially high risk of being found to have an acute respiratory illness in the days after exposure than the days before.
The risk increased the more people were exposed, the researchers said.
The miserable initial effects of tear gas — including stinging in the eyes and throat — typically lasts for only 15 to 30 minutes after a person who has been exposed gets to an area with cleaner air. But many of the illnesses in the Army research surfaced days after exposure. Researchers cautioned that illnesses were not lab-checked, and could have been caused by damage to the respiratory tract rather than infection, or could have been prompted by other factors.
A study in Turkey examining the long-term effects of tear gas found that people who had been exposed had a higher risk for chronic bronchitis.
Tear gas has been around for decades, used around the world as a riot-control tool, including in Hong Kong during recent uprisings there. Treaties prohibit its use during war.
Jordt said he worried that the effects on healthy, young military recruits may also not fully capture the risks to people who are older or have underlying conditions. He said more research was needed on tear gas generally, since much of the research was decades old, but that it had been difficult to get funding to examine the issue.
The protests after Floyd’s death have focused on the disproportionate effects of police killings on black Americans, with protests led by groups such as Black Lives Matter. People of color have also been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths than white people.
Researchers have long found that smoking can cause damage to upper airways and increase the risk of lung infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that conditions such as asthma and chronic lung disease can increase the risk of someone getting a severe coronavirus illness.
The CDC has said that prolonged exposure to riot-control agents may lead to long-term effects to eyes and breathing problems such as asthma.
The use of tear gas to disperse protesters has been the subject of criticism from organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union.
Jamil Dakwar, the director of the ACLU’s Human Rights Program, said tear gas had become an overused tactic that could actually increase the volatility of a situation. He said the weapons that were so indiscriminate should not be used for dispersing people or in protests.
“It has become a first-resort weapon rather than a last resort,” Dakwar said.
Dakwar said he would like to see state and federal legislation that would restrict the use of those techniques. While the ACLU was not advocating an outright ban, he said the priority should be on de-escalation techniques.
Dakwar said the gas was so indiscriminate that he also worried about the health effects on police officers.

Luego de un fin de semana de protestas que llegaron hasta la puerta misma de la Casa Blanca y que lo forzaron a internarse brevemente en un búnker subterráneo, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, llegó el lunes 1 de junio al Despacho Oval perturbado por las imágenes mostradas en televisión. Le molestaba que alguien pudiera pensar que se estaba escondiendo y se encontraba deseoso por actuar.
Trump quería enviar el ejército a algunas ciudades del país, una idea que provocó una discusión acalorada, en la que se elevaron las voces, entre sus asesores. Pero, para el final del día, a instancias de su hija Ivanka, el presidente elaboró una forma más personal de demostrar dureza: caminaría a través de la plaza Lafayette hasta una iglesia que había sido dañada por el fuego la noche anterior.
Había un problema: el plan desarrollado durante el día para ensanchar el perímetro de seguridad alrededor de la Casa Blanca aún no se había llevado a cabo. Cuando el fiscal general William P. Barr salió de la Casa Blanca para una inspección personal a inicios de la tarde del lunes, descubrió que los manifestantes seguían en el extremo norte de la plaza. Para que el presidente pudiera llegar a la iglesia de St. John, tendrían que vaciarla. Barr dio la orden de dispersar a los manifestantes.
El resultado fue un estallido de violencia a la sombra de la Casa Blanca como no se había visto en generaciones. Mientras se preparaba para su caminata sorpresa a la iglesia, Trump primero apareció ante las cámaras en el Jardín de Rosas para autoproclamarse “su presidente de la ley y el orden” y también “un aliado de todos los manifestantes pacíficos”, aun cuando los manifestantes pacíficos a una cuadra de distancia y los clérigos en el patio de la iglesia estaban siendo dispersados por el humo, las granadas cegadoras y alguna forma de aerosol químico utilizado por los oficiales antidisturbios y la policía montada.
Un día después de que reprendió a los gobernadores por ser “débiles” y los sermoneó para que “dominaran” a los manifestantes, el presidente salió de la Casa Blanca, seguido de una falange de asistentes y agentes del servicio secreto en su camino hacia la iglesia, donde posó con el gesto adusto, sosteniendo una Biblia que su hija sacó antes de su bolso MaxMara de 1540 dólares.
Las fotografías resultantes de Trump caminando decidido a través de la plaza satisficieron su arraigado deseo de proyectar fortaleza. Su equipo de campaña empezó rápidamente a circular las imágenes y a fijarlas en sus cuentas de Twitter, una vez que el presidente se encontraba seguro y de regreso en una Casa Blanca fortificada.
La escena de los estragos que precedieron a la caminata —a poco más de 300 metros del símbolo de la democracia estadounidense— evocó imágenes comúnmente asociadas con países autoritarios, pero esto no molestó al presidente, quien tiene un largo historial de coqueteos con autócratas extranjeros y ha expresado envidia por su capacidad de dominación.
Durante su tiempo al mando de Estados Unidos, Trump ha generado preocupación debido a lo que sus críticos ven como instintos autocráticos, que incluyen sus reivindicaciones de poder ilimitado para “hacer lo que quiera”, sus ataques a instituciones semiautónomas del gobierno como el FBI o los inspectores generales y sus esfuerzos por desacreditar fuentes independientes de información que lo enfurecen, como la prensa, a la que llama “enemiga del pueblo”.
Y cuando se escriba la historia de la presidencia Trump, el choque de la plaza Lafayette quizá sea recordado como uno de sus momentos definitorios.
Trump y su círculo íntimo consideraron que se trató de un triunfo y que tendría eco positivo con muchos estadounidense de a pie, disgustados por las escenas de los disturbios y saqueos que han acompañado las protestas pacíficas por la muerte de un hombre afroamericano a manos de la policía en Mineápolis.
Pero algunos críticos, entre ellos algunos republicanos, estaban horrorizados ante el uso de la fuerza contra ciudadanos que no suponían ningún tipo de amenaza en ese momento, todo para organizar lo que consideraron un torpe posado fotográfico que mostró únicamente rostros blancos. Algunos senadores demócratas utilizaron términos como “fascista” y “dictador” para describir las palabras y acciones del presidente.
La obispo Mariann Edgar Budde de la diócesis episcopal de Washington, quien no fue consultada de antemano, dijo que estaba “indignada” por el uso de una sus iglesias como escenario político para alardear de la represión de protestas contra el racismo. Incluso algunos funcionarios de la Casa Blanca expresaron en privado su consternación porque el séquito del presidente no hubiera pensado en incluir a una sola persona de color.
La alcaldesa Muriel E. Bowser de Washington objetó la acción tajantemente el martes y dijo que el gobierno federal había incluso abordado en privado la idea de hacerse cargo de la policía de la ciudad, algo a lo que ella prometió oponerse. “No creo que el ejército deba usarse en las calles de ciudades estadounidenses contra estadounidenses”, dijo, “y definitivamente no creo que deba hacerse para un espectáculo”.
El condado de Arlington, en los suburbios de Virginia, retiró a sus agentes de policía del grupo reunido para proteger la Casa Blanca y otros edificios federales luego del choque de la plaza Lafayette. E incluso antes de esto, los gobernadores demócratas de Virginia, Nueva York y Delaware se negaron a enviar las tropas de la Guardia Nacional que el gobierno de Trump había solicitado.
El espectáculo organizado por la Casa Blanca también colocó a los líderes militares en una difícil posición a la hora de explicar por qué, según las críticas de oficiales retirados, habían permitido que los utilizaran como utilería política. El secretario de Defensa, Mark T. Esper, y el general Mark A. Milley, presidente del Estado Mayor Conjunto, hicieron saber a través de oficiales militares que ellos no supieron con antelación de la dispersión de manifestantes ni los planes del presidente para un posado fotográfico. E insistieron en que ellos pensaban que iban a acompañarlo a pasar revista a las tropas.
La acción policial allanó el camino para el posado fotográfico pero a duras penas calmó la ira en las calles. Para la tarde del martes, los manifestantes habían vuelto a los límites de la plaza Lafayette —donde durante la noche se habían levantado nuevas vallas— y gritaron su descontento frente a la fila de oficiales vestidos de negro.
“Sáquense el equipo antidisturbios, aquí no hay disturbios”, cantaron.
El martes sus asistentes defendieron la caminata de Trump a la iglesia, dado que se había suscitado un pequeño incendio en su sótano durante las protestas de fin de semana. “El presidente sintió al ver esas imágenes la noche del domingo, que se había cruzado una línea terrible que va mucho más allá de la protesta pacífica”, le dijo a los reporteros Kellyanne Conway, su consejera.
Pero Conway lo distanció de las decisiones que se tomaron para dispersar a la multitud. “Claramente, el presidente no sabe cómo manejan sus movimientos los cuerpos de seguridad”, dijo.
Este recuento del choque está basado en las descripciones de los reporteros en el lugar de los hechos, entrevistas con decenas de manifestantes, ayudantes de la Casa Blanca, agentes de los cuerpos de seguridad, líderes de la ciudad y otros involucrados en un día tenso, así como en un análisis de los videos del equipo de investigaciones visuales de The New York Times.
La mañana en la Casa Blanca
Trump estaba inquieto la mañana del lunes al reunirse con los asesores de seguridad nacional y cuerpos de seguridad para discutir lo que podía hacerse respecto a la agitación callejera. Los asesores le dijeron que no podía dejar que la capital de la nación se desbordara, que el simbolismo era demasiado importante y que tenía que controlar la situación esa noche.
Entre las ideas que se barajaron estaba invocar la Ley de Insurrección, una ley del siglo XIX que permitiría al presidente enviar personal militar en activo a apagar los disturbios por encima de las objeciones de los gobernadores. La ley ha sido controversial desde hace mucho tiempo. El presidente George Bush la invocó en 1992 para responder a los disturbios de Rodney King solo a pedido de California. Pero en la era de los derechos civiles, los presidentes enviaban a las tropas para hacer valer el fin de la segregación a pesar de la resistencia de los gobernadores racistas.
Su uso es tan controversial que el presidente George W. Bush dudó de invocarla para responder al huracán Katrina por temor a que pareciera que intentaba desautorizar a los líderes locales y estatales.
El vicepresidente, Mike Pence, estaba a favor de la idea, bajo el razonamiento de que permitiría actuar con mayor rapidez que llamar a las unidades de la Guardia Nacional, y Esper lo apoyó. Pero Barr y el general Milley le aseguraron al presidente que tenía ya suficiente fuerza en la capital del país para asegurar la ciudad y expresó preocupación de llamar a soldados en activo para desempeñar un papel como ese.
Varios funcionarios tuvieron distintas impresiones de la posición de Mark Meadows, el jefe de Gabinete, respecto al tema pero la discusión se acaloró cuando empezaron a alzarse las voces y aumentar la tensión.
Trump y Pence entonces llevaron a cabo una llamada en conferencia con los gobernadores del país en la que el presidente los reprendió por ser “débiles” y “tontos” y les aconsejó “dominar” a los manifestantes. Esper habló de controlar “el espacio de batalla”.
El presidente habló con reverencia sobre la represión en Mineápolis una vez que la Guardia Nacional había llegado. “Es algo hermoso de ver”, dijo. “Simplemente no puede ser mejor. No se necesita experimento. No tienen que hacerse pruebas”.
Planeación de mediodía
En Washington, Barr estaba a cargo de la respuesta federal. Contaba con oficiales de tantas agencias como pueden deletrearse con una sopa de letras, agentes y tropas para defender la Casa Blanca y otras instalaciones federales, entre ellos el Servicio Secreto, la Policía de Parques de Estados Unidos, la Guardia Nacional, la Policía del Capitolio, la Oficina de Alcohol, Tabaco, Armas de Fuego y Explosivos, el Servicio de Alguaciles, la Oficina de Prisiones, Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza e Inmigración y Control de Aduanas.
A Barr le preocupaban las manifestaciones cercanas a la Casa Blanca que durante el fin de semana habían resultado en un pequeño incendio en el sótano de la iglesia de St. John y el grafiti en la sede del Departamento del Tesoro, así que decidió extender el perímetro de seguridad más lejos de la mansión.
Se convocaron refuerzos. Justo antes del mediodía, se envió una alerta a todos los agentes del área de Washington pertenecientes a la Oficina de Investigaciones de Seguridad Nacional, una división de ICE, diciéndoles que se preparen para ayudar con cualquier manifestación, según un correo electrónico etiquetado de gravedad “alta”. El FBI desplegó su equipo de rescate de rehenes de élite, agentes altamente armados y entrenados más acostumbrados a arrestar a sospechosos peligrosos que a enfrentarse a disturbios. Por su parte ICE desplegó sus “equipos especiales de respuesta” para proteger las instalaciones de la agencia y se quedó de guardia.
Pero otros eran reacios a ayudar. Trump fue tan agresivo en la llamada con los gobernadores que cuando el gobernador Ralph Northam de Virginia recibió una solicitud para enviar hasta 5000 de las tropas de la Guardia Nacional de su estado, se preocupó. Su personal contactó a la oficina de Bowser y descubrió que la alcaldesa ni siquiera había sido notificada de la solicitud. En ese momento, Northam rechazó a la Casa Blanca. Del mismo modo, el gobernador Andrew Cuomo de Nueva York canceló los autobuses de las tropas de la Guardia Nacional que iban a Washington.
Hacia la media tarde del lunes, los manifestantes se habían reunido una vez más en la calle H y en la parte norte de la plaza Lafayette, esta vez de manera pacífica. La reverenda Gini Gerbasi, rectora de la iglesia de St. John en Georgetown y quien había sido rectora asistente en St. John, llegó cerca de las 4 de la tarde con cajas de agua para los manifestantes. En el patio de la iglesia se le unieron unos 20 clérigos que repartieron bocadillos.
Junto a ellos, en el patio, un grupo afiliado a Black Lives Matter mezclaba agua y jabón en botellas exprimibles para usar como enjuague de ojos de emergencia si los manifestantes eran rociados con gases lacrimógenos por parte de la policía.
Si bien ocasionalmente hubo algunos encuentros agresivos con la policía, dijo Gerbasi, en gran parte había tranquilidad. “Hubo algunos momentos tensos”, dijo. “Pero fue pacífico”.
Cerca, en la Casa Blanca, Trump estaba ideando su plan de caminar a la iglesia. Varios funcionarios del gobierno dijeron que fue idea suya; dos funcionarios dijeron que Meadows se la atribuyó a Ivanka Trump durante una reunión de personal de alto nivel el martes. El plan fue diseñado durante una reunión del Despacho Oval en la que participaron Ivanka Trump, Meadows, Jared Kushner, yerno y asesor principal del presidente, y Hope Hicks, otra asesora principal.
En algún momento, Anthony Ornato, un veterano del Servicio Secreto que se desempeña como subdirector de personal para operaciones, fue requerido para coordinar la logística de la visita. A Hicks se le ocurrió cómo luciría. Pero los funcionarios admitieron en privado que se pensó poco en lo que haría Trump una vez que llegara a la iglesia. Se discutió la posibilidad de entrar, pero estaba cerrado.
El presidente y su equipo decidieron que primero haría una declaración en el Jardín de las Rosas en la que expresaría condolencias hacia la familia de George Floyd, el hombre negro que murió en Mineápolis cuando un oficial de policía se arrodilló en su cuello durante casi nueve minutos. Luego Trump mostraría una postura firme a favor de recuperar las calles. Amenazaría con invocar la Ley de Insurrección en caso de que los gobernadores y alcaldes no hicieran un mejor trabajo de seguridad. A los periodistas se les dijo que habría una declaración, pero la marcha a la iglesia se mantuvo en secreto. Barr salió de la Casa Blanca y entró en la plaza Lafayette solo para descubrir que el plan de extender el perímetro de seguridad no se había llevado a cabo. Ordenó a los agentes sobre el terreno que completaran la expansión, lo que implicaba dispersar a los manifestantes, pero no hubo tiempo suficiente para hacerlo antes de la declaración planificada del presidente.
Antes del choque
A las 5:07 de la tarde, camiones de la Guardia Nacional cargados de tropas se dirigieron al norte por la avenida West Executive, un carril en el complejo de la Casa Blanca entre el ala oeste y el Edificio de Oficinas Ejecutivas Eisenhower, y pasaron por la entrada de visitantes, salieron por las puertas y giraron a la derecha en la avenida Pennsylvania.
Poco después, dos miembros del equipo de contraataque del Servicio Secreto aparecieron en el techo del ala oeste con armas y binoculares, mirando hacia el norte hacia la plaza Lafayette. Si bien los francotiradores se instalan en el techo principal de la Casa Blanca de cuando en cuando, generalmente no son destacados a la parte superior del ala oeste, y la imagen era chocante para quienes acuden regularmente al edificio.
El cuerpo de prensa de la Casa Blanca fue convocado al Jardín de las Rosas a las 6:03 de la tarde. Afuera de las puertas y al otro lado de la plaza Lafayette, varios de los oficiales con equipo antidisturbios se arrodillaron y algunos manifestantes pensaron que estaban expresando solidaridad como lo ha hecho la policía en otras ciudades, pero, de hecho, se estaban poniendo sus máscaras antigás.
A las 6:17 de la tarde, una gran falange de agentes que vestían uniformes del Servicio Secreto comenzó a avanzar hacia los manifestantes, trepando o saltando barreras en el borde de la plaza en la calle H y Madison Place. Las autoridades dijeron más tarde que la policía advirtió tres veces a los manifestantes, pero si lo hicieron, los reporteros en el lugar y muchos manifestantes no lo escucharon.
Se disparó algún tipo de agente químico a los manifestantes, se lanzaron granadas cegadoras y la policía montada se dirigió hacia la multitud. “La gente estaba cayendo al piso” al sonido de golpes y estallidos que sonaban como disparos, dijo Gerbasi. “Comenzamos a ver y a oler gases lacrimógenos, y la gente corría hacia nosotros”.
A eso de las 6:30 de la tarde, dijo, “de repente la policía estaba en una fila, en el patio de la iglesia de St. John, literalmente presionando y empujando a la gente fuera del patio”.
Julia Dominick, seminarista del Seminario Teológico de Virginia, en Alexandría, Virginia, y enfermera de emergencias retirada, estaba atendiendo a un manifestante cuando una línea de policía avanzó.
“No hubo una advertencia”, dijo. “Nunca he estado en una guerra. Nunca me han disparado. Nunca he sentido miedo de esa manera. Esos sonidos y el gas, se quedarán conmigo”. (Ninguna agencia policial reconoció el uso de gases lacrimógenos, pero los periodistas y manifestantes en el lugar dijeron que claramente había un irritante químico de algún tipo).
A las 6:43 de la tarde, Trump hizo su declaración en el Jardín de las Rosas y concluyó siete minutos después. Después volvió a entrar a la Casa Blanca y salió por el lado norte, atravesó el portón camino al parque. Barr, Esper, el general Milley, Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Kushner y otros lo siguieron, pero Pence y su personal se quedaron mientras el edificio se vaciaba y lo vieron por televisión.
El movimiento del presidente sorprendió a casi todos, como pretendía, incluidas a las fuerzas del orden. El jefe de policía de Washington dijo que fue notificado solo unos momentos antes. Los comandantes de la Policía de Parques estaban tan sorprendidos como todos los demás al ver al presidente en el parque.
Al llegar a St. John, Trump no fingió otra intención que no fuera el posado para las fotografías: levantó la Biblia que llevaba su hija y luego reunió a algunos de los altos asesores junto a él en una fila. No hizo comentarios y luego, una vez cumplido su propósito, regresó a la Casa Blanca, pasando en el camino frente a una pared con un nuevo grafiti que decía: “ Fuck Trump” (A la mierda Trump).
La policía y otras fuerzas persiguieron a los manifestantes alrededor de la capital el resto de la noche, con helicópteros militares que incluso se lanzaron a baja altura como demostraciones de fuerza. Barr y el general Milley recorrieron las calles en diferentes puntos.
La mañana del martes Trump se jactó de haber triunfado. “D.C. no tuvo problemas anoche”, escribió en Twitter. “Muchos arrestos. Todos hicieron un gran trabajo. Fuerza abrumadora. Dominación. Igualmente, Mineápolis estuvo grandiosa (¡gracias, presidente Trump!).”
Para la tarde del martes, las multitudes habían vuelto y eran incluso más numerosas.

Dozens of journalists covering the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality have said they were attacked, arrested, intimidated with weapons or shot with nonlethal projectiles while doing their jobs.
In response, the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota on Tuesday filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit accusing a city of abridging the constitutionally mandated freedom of the press.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Jared Goyette, a freelance journalist who has contributed to The Washington Post and The Guardian in recent days, named the city of Minneapolis along with several law enforcement officials as defendants. The ACLU is seeking class-action status for the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Minnesota.
The Minneapolis city attorney, Erik Nilsson, said in a statement Wednesday that “we will review the allegations and take them seriously.”
“We continue to support the First Amendment rights of everyone in Minneapolis,” he added.
According to the complaint, Goyette was reporting on a protest in south Minneapolis last week when he was shot in the face with what the suit described as “less-lethal ballistic ammunition.” At the time, he was helping an injured person, and there was no warning before the projectile was fired, the suit said. Goyette was identifiable as a member of the press by a camera attached to a stand and his notepad, the suit said.
“These acts would chill a reasonable person from continuing to engage in a constitutionally protected activity,” the lawsuit said. “These acts did, in fact, chill plaintiff and the plaintiff class from continuing to observe and record some events of public interest, including constitutionally protected demonstrations and the conduct of law enforcement officers on duty in a public place.”
Minneapolis, the city where George Floyd was killed while in police custody May 25, has been the site of numerous protests. Many journalists who covered those demonstrations and others around the country told The New York Times that they were targeted by police officers while doing their jobs, even as they wore press badges or informed law enforcement officials that they were journalists.
The ACLU said this lawsuit would not be the last it would file on behalf of journalists who have been harmed while covering the protests.
“We will not let these official abuses go unanswered,” Brian Hauss, a lawyer with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in a statement. “This is the first of many lawsuits the ACLU intends to file across the country. Law enforcement officers who target journalists will be held accountable.”
Journalists are not immune to crowd-control orders, but the First Amendment is widely recognized to confer protections on the work of public documentation. Many cities, including Minneapolis, have seemingly recognized the special status of journalists by exempting them from the curfews that have gone into effect in recent days.
The ACLU lawsuit noted other journalists targeted by law enforcement in Minneapolis while covering recent protests, drawn from Twitter posts and news reports.
The defendants in the suit “interfered with the news media’s right to cover public events by refusing access to areas where events were unfolding and creating obstacles to the reporters’ movement about the city,” the lawsuit said. “These incidents constitute flagrant infringements on the constitutional rights of individual reporters, as well as the public’s interest in the dissemination of accurate information and accountability of government.”
The lawsuit asked for a declaration of constitutional violation and an injunction. It asserted that the defendants had retaliated against Goyette and other journalists for exercising their First Amendment rights; had unlawfully “seized” Goyette and others, under the Fourth Amendment, in their attacks; and denied them due process of law.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Twitter and its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, placed warnings on three of President Donald Trump’s tweets last week, taking a measured but hotly debated step to place some limit on the president’s use of social media to spread falsehoods and incite his followers.
Twitter attached labels refuting two of Trump’s tweets on voter fraud and restricted one that implied that protesters in Minneapolis could be shot. But it left countless others unchallenged, including those baselessly insinuating that Joe Scarborough, the MSNBC host, killed a former staff member.
A New York Times review of the president’s 139 Twitter posts from Sunday, May 24, to Saturday, May 30, found at least 26 contained clearly false claims, including five about mail-in voting that were not flagged, five promoting the false conspiracy theory about Scarborough and three about Twitter itself. Another 24 were misleading, lacked context or traded in innuendo. (This analysis did not include dozens of Trump’s retweets.)
To put it another way, more than a third of the president’s tweets over the course of a week contained dubious information. That presents a challenge both to Twitter and to the millions of people who are exposed to Trump on social media, especially now, with the nation facing the triple challenge of a pandemic, economic dislocation and nationwide protests over systemic racism.
Unsubstantiated charges of fraud in mail-in voting
Twitter attached information to refute two of Trump’s posts about mail-in voting that falsely claimed that California was sending ballots to “anyone living in the state no matter who they are or how they got there.” State officials will mail ballots to registered voters only.
Dorsey said that those tweets May 26 specifically violated the company’s civic integrity policy as they “may mislead people into thinking they don’t need to register to get a ballot.”
Five others posts by Trump repeated his general falsehoods about mail-in voting but did not specify any one state’s election process or ballot distribution plans — and were not affixed with a label.
Two days before Twitter labeled the two tweets May 26, the president warned twice that the upcoming presidential election will be “rigged” through mail-in ballots. After Twitter’s actions, Trump continued to claim that mail-in voting would lead to a “free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots,” a ”tainted” election process, “MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE” and “THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY.”
There is no evidence for any of these claims. Voter fraud in general is extremely rare. While mail-in voting is less secure than in-person voting, fraud incidence rates remain extremely low — one study found an improper voting rate of 0.004%. Studies have found little evidence that mail-in voting and so-called no-excuse absentee voting benefit one political party over another.
Inaccurate claims about Twitter
Trump responded to Twitter’s actions by issuing an executive order that seeks to strip liability protection in certain cases for companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook for the content on their sites. If carried out, the order could lead to the companies facing legal liability for false and defamatory statements posted on their sites.
The president also took to Twitter to castigate the platform in three false posts.
He accused the company of “completely stifling FREE SPEECH.” But this is a misreading of the First Amendment, which prohibits Congress from “abridging the freedom of speech.” While the Supreme Court has held that this applies to all government agencies, it does not apply to private companies like Twitter.
In two tweets Friday morning, Trump complained that Twitter had not flagged “China’s propaganda.” But the company had attached similar warning labels two days earlier to tweets posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, that suggested that the coronavirus originated in the United States.
Baseless claims about ongoing protests
Trump has dismissed the nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd by suggesting they are not organic or legitimate.
In three tweets, he said without evidence that the protests across the country and in front of the White House were “professionally organized” and “have nothing to do with George Floyd.”
While it is impossible to know the motivation of every person participating in these demonstrations, Trump’s broad generalization discounts the thousands who have taken to the streets specifically to protest the killing of Floyd, a black man who died after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer.
In another tweet Saturday, Trump said that “80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE.” This was an estimate first offered by Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a Democrat. But after reporting by local news outlets that suggested the opposite was true, Walz declined to repeat the estimate and said that more data was needed to properly characterize the proportion of those arrested who were not local residents.
These theories echoed Trump’s previous claims that those who protested the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 were paid by George Soros, the billionaire investor and Democratic donor.
Trump did not name the supposed organizers of the current protests.
Other falsehoods
Other inaccuracies from a week of Trump’s tweets centered on familiar foes and oft-repeated boasts.
Trump tweeted, with no evidence, that Speaker Nancy Pelosi had complained that he had moved too quickly in imposing some restrictions on travel from China in response to the coronavirus. The Times was unable to find an instance of Pelosi publicly addressing or criticizing that decision.
He repeated his claim that former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had “apologized” for opposing the policy. No record of an apology exists.
He falsely accused Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., of breaking his campaign promise to vote against Pelosi for speaker. Lamb, who won his seat in 2018, voted for Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III, D-Mass., when the House held its election for speaker last year.
He falsely claimed Saturday that Washington’s Democratic mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, “wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved” in monitoring protests outside of the White House on Friday. But the Secret Service, which Trump praised in the same tweet, said in a statement that it had made six arrests that night and “the Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.”
He again took undue credit for the Veterans Choice health care program. The program was created in 2014, developed by Sens. John McCain and Bernie Sanders and signed by former President Barack Obama — three of Trump’s political enemies.
Trump’s declaration that “it was me who shattered 100% of the ISIS Caliphate” was also not true. About a third to a half of the territory formerly held by the Islamic State was regained under Obama’s administration, according to military and independent estimates. And officials and experts had always anticipated that the campaign, started in 2014, long before Trump took office, would result in pushing the extremist group out of its self-declared caliphate.
Half truths and murky accusations
Three dozen tweets from the president occupied a factual gray zone. Some were typical examples of political spin, neither completely true nor totally wrong.
Twice, he claimed to have banned travel from China and to have done so “before anybody thought necessary” to contain the spread of the coronavirus. These were exaggerations. The restrictions did not amount to full ban. They did not apply to U.S. citizens or green card holders, and they contained other exemptions. Numerous other countries had taken similar actions before Trump did.
He misleadingly boasted of the United States having carried out 15 million coronavirus tests, “by far the most in the World,” and the number of cases and deaths “going down all over the Country.” The raw number of tests, while accurate, did not reflect that the United States continues to lag other countries in testing per capita. Cases and deaths were decreasing across the country as a whole, but not in some states.
Ten tweets were devoted to the announcement of grants to local transit agencies from the Department of Transportation. Left unsaid was that these grants have been routinely awarded since the 2013 federal fiscal year and in the first two years of his presidency, Trump’s proposed budgets called for the grants to be phased out.
Other tweets were ambiguously worded, making them difficult to fact check even as they hint at nefarious activity.
Trump twice said that social media companies “attempted”and “failed” to do something in the 2016 election but never specified what exactly the companies attempted. (In the past, he has mischaracterized research to mount a baseless suggestion that Google “manipulated” votes.)
Perhaps there’s no better example of how Trump trades in vague claims than his repeated allegations of the “greatest political crime” or scandal in history, committed by the Obama administration to undercut his 2016 campaign and the start of his presidency. In four tweets, the president echoed this but never specified what that crime was. In others, he simply referred to “Obamagate.”

WASHINGTON — With about an hour to go before a citywide curfew was set to take effect Monday, demonstrators outside the White House were caught by surprise as throngs of police officers in riot gear spilled out from the northeastern corner of Lafayette Square, deploying force to cut a path across the street toward St. John’s Episcopal Church.
Moments later, out of sight of many of the protesters who had been driven back, President Donald Trump walked past the church steps and produced a Bible.
Standing outside the church, which had been damaged and boarded up after days of demonstrations against police brutality, Trump struck different poses, displaying the book for cameras, ostensibly upside-down at times.
“Is that your Bible?” a reporter asked. “It’s a Bible,” Trump replied.
The president said nothing else about the significance of the site or the circumstances of his appearance before walking back toward the White House. But the display caused immediate consternation, not only because of the tense, political backdrop just feet away, but also because of Trump’s curious and at times confounding remarks about the Bible and his relationship with the text.
The president has offered only limited glimpses into the role Christianity has played in his upbringing and adult life. He was raised Presbyterian and has cited the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, a pastor and the author of “The Power of Positive Thinking,” as one of his earliest influences. He has said he attends church in observance of major holidays like Christmas and Easter, and has often named the Bible as his favorite book (though when pressed, he has also named some of his own books).
When Trump was sworn in as president, he joined a handful of presidents who took the oath of office on two bibles. One of them was a gift from his mother given two days before his ninth birthday, which Trump has kept since 1955.
But at times, the president’s conversations about his faith have betrayed an understanding of the Bible that religious scholars and leaders have described as limited or distorted.
In an interview with Bloomberg Politics in 2015, Trump demurred when asked to explain which Bible verses he counted among his favorites.
“I wouldn’t want to get into it because to me that’s very personal,” he said. “You know when I talk about the Bible, it’s very personal. So I don’t want to get into verses.”
When one of his interviewers tried to broaden the question — “Are you an Old Testament guy or a New Testament guy?” — Trump replied: “Probably equal. I think it’s just an incredible — the whole Bible is incredible.”
When asked about his favorite biblical teaching on other occasions, Trump has given different answers. Three months later in September 2015, he cited a Book of Proverbs passage about never “bending to envy” that scholars have said does not exist. Asked again in April 2016, Trump pointed to the Old Testament teaching of “an eye for an eye,” which he said resonated with his view that the United States had been taken advantage of by rivals.
Giving an address at Liberty University in January 2016, Trump drew laughter with an errant reference to “Two Corinthians,” a commonly quoted book properly known as “Second Corinthians” to adherents.
The president has also been inconsistent in his own assessment of his biblical knowledge.
On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump told a crowd in Nevada, “Nobody reads the Bible more than me.” But in December, Trump offered a different view at a White House Hanukkah reception, lightheartedly imagining the evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress’ impression of him: “He may not be the greatest Christian I’ve ever seen. He may not know the Bible quite as well as the rest of us. In fact, he may not know it very well at all.”
Jeffress on Monday defended Trump’s appearance at St. John’s against critics, including the bishop who oversees the church, saying that God “hates lawlessness,” according to a report in The Atlantic. The bishop, Mariann Edgar Budde, accused Trump of appropriating religious symbols to deflect criticism in a series of interviews Tuesday.
Other faith leaders have also suggested in the past that some of Trump’s actions and crasser remarks do not square with Christian values. During the 2016 presidential primary, Pope Francis implied that Trump was “not Christian,” given his remarks about Mexican immigrants and other groups that the pope framed as incompatible with Scripture. In December, a number of religious leaders condemned a remark Trump made at a rally suggesting that Rep. Debbie Dingell’s late husband, John D. Dingell Jr., was “looking up” from hell. And in February, the president invited criticism for using an address at the National Prayer Breakfast to attack the faith of political rivals.
However, many of Trump’s less conventional acts surrounding the Bible have often been accepted and even celebrated by evangelicals. When critics pounced after Trump passed out signed copies of the Bible to survivors of a hurricane in Alabama, many faith leaders quickly pointed out that several former presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, had signed Bibles as well.
While Trump’s actual reading of Scripture may be subject to debate, the president has said he has plenty of Bibles on hand, as he has maintained a personal collection over the years.
“I get sent Bibles by a lot of people,” Trump said in an interview with CBN News in 2015. “So actually I store them, and keep them, and sometimes give them away to other people, but I do get sent a lot of Bibles.”

Full text: The mayhem in the central business district -- long an emblem of New York's stature -- was a new blow to a city already weakened by the virus outbreak.
The looters tore off the plywood that boarded up Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, swarming by the dozens inside to steal whatever they could find before being chased down by the police. Others smashed the windows at a Nike store, grabbing shirts, jeans and zip-up jackets. They crashed into a Coach store,ransacked a Bergdorf Goodman branch and destroyed scores of smaller storefronts along the way.
The eruption of looting in the central business district of Manhattan -- long an emblem of the New York's stature and prowess -- struck yet another blow to a city reeling from the nation's worst coronavirus outbreak.
The mayhem late on Monday night and into the early morning marred otherwise peaceful protests conducted by thousands of people across the city in the wake of the death of George Floyd, and it touched off a new crisis for Mayor Bill de Blasio. On Tuesday his fellow Democrat and frequent rival, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, criticized the city's response, saying, "The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night."
Beginning Monday afternoon and growing wilder as night fell, small bands of young people dressed mostly in black pillaged chain stores, upscale boutiquesand kitschy trinket stores in Midtown Manhattan, as the police at first struggled in vain to impose order.
Within hours, the normally vibrant center of wealth and upscale retail had descended into an almost clichéd vision of disorder: Streets were speckled with broken glass and trash can fires. Bands of looters pillaged stores without regard for nearby police officers. The screech of sirens echoed between skyscrapers.
By the early morning hours, a sense of lawlessness had set in.
After a weekend filled with shocking scenes of looting, scuffles between the police and protesters and destruction of police cars, the governor and mayor announced Monday afternoon that they would deploy twice as many police officers and impose an 11 p.m. curfew.
The curfew succeeded in ending most of the peaceful protests before midnight. As for the looters, it seemed only to embolden them to start earlier in the day. Even before the curfew took effect, the mayor announced Monday night that the curfew on Tuesday would begin at 8 p.m.
On Monday, protesters sometimes deputized themselves to stop the destruction and stealing. When one group shattered the windows of an Aldo shoe store in the afternoon, protesters rushed forward to push them away from the store, pulling one young man out of the broken window as he tried to climb inside.
"Stop doing this!" one distraught woman yelled, her friends holding her back as she lunged toward the looters. "George Floyd's brother said not to do this! That is not what this is about!"
Several reporters and photographers for The New York Times witnessed numerous scenes of people setting upon storefronts all across Midtown. The police at first appeared outnumbered before eventually massing reinforcements and making arrests.
Even before the governor's remark, the mayor and the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, pushed back at the notion that the police had not been up to the task. They noted that officers had made 700 arrests, by far the most of any night since the protests began last week, and that the entire department was trying to deal with a constantly shifting, citywide series of street demonstrations both orderly and not.
"There is no such thing as being able to loot with impunity," the mayor said at a news conference. "I'm so sick of these efforts to mischaracterize reality."
"I was all over New York City last night," he continued. "I saw police officers trying to deal with a very difficult situation."
The mayhem was perhaps most serious at Macy's flagship on 34th Street, one of the largest department stores in the world. Video showed scenes of chaos as fires burned on the street and looters began gathering in front of one of the blocked entryways.
One man repeatedly kicked the plywood as cheers erupted from other looters. When the door was broken, people raced inside, followed later by police officers dashing through the aisles, trying to catch them.
At a Nike store, dozens of people, mostly teenagers, broke in the front glass and entered the store, grabbing jeans, jackets and other apparel as the security alarm blared. Looters scurried in and out of the store, blanketing the sidewalk in empty hangers, while crowds of protesters berated them from the street.
"That's not what this is about!" one group chanted.
Several minutes later, police sirens could be heard in the distance. But when officers arrived, they were too late: both the looters and the protest march they had splintered away from were long gone.
As Midtown drained of demonstrators, more swarms of marauders poured into the streets, smashing shop windows and rushing through already broken-into buildings.
As they hopped from store to store, they grabbed clothing and tried to grab jewelry from lockboxes. But many high-ticket items were left untouched. On Fifth Avenue, a crowd smashed the window of a Camper shoe store, but did not take the pair of $ 800 sneakers advertised prominently by the entrance.
A different group shattered the windows of a boutique tea shop, leaving a traffic cone hanging, nose out, through a hole in one of its windows. But they disturbed almost none of its merchandise, creating a surreal scene of smashed glass and delicate, carefully preserved tea sets -- their bright red cups and saucers balanced in an avant-garde display.
It seemed for some that the desire to steal was less alluring than the thrill of destroying and, with few police officers cracking down, relishing in a powerful feeling of impunity.
Along Broadway, roving bands of young people dashed between destroyed stores and biked freely along the empty roads. Even as rows of police vans flanked the surrounding streets, the looters seemed to know that they were winning the game of cat and mouse.
"They're looting, causing damage, they didn't come here to protest," said one security guard on Broadway between 37th and 38th Streets, who declined to give his name. "One kid flashed his knife at me. It's just a bunch of kids, no adults."
Around 9 p.m., the guard watched as looters shattered the storefront at an Urban Outfitters two blocks away. The group then tore through the store, leaving hangers, clothes and display stands strewn across the floor in their wake.
An hour later -- while the police stood within sight -- people peered in to assess what merchandise was left. One man in a red sweatshirt jumped through a shattered glass panel and emerged seconds later with two large boxes in his hands.
On Fifth Avenue, Cartier, Gucci, Versace, Armani, Zara, and Salvatore Ferragamo had all armored their stores with plywood to protect against the swelling theft.
Others were frantically trying to do so, even as the looting wore on: At 10:45 p.m. outside a Santander Bank on 35th Street, construction workers sawed pieces of wood and boarded up the bank as small groups of young people passed them on the street and rummaged through already shattered stores.
On Seventh Avenue, Heidi Murga, 34, watched as a group of people broke into a FedEx store. After the looters dispersed, Ms. Murga, who works as a broker and lives in Midtown, decided to stand guard outside the store to ward off other bands of looters.
"I'm just going to stand here and pretend it's my store, it's what I can do," she said. "This is not protest, this is violence, completely."
She added: "I don't like this at all, this is not the city I moved to."
By the time the citywide curfew went into effect at 11 p.m., the mood had darkened: an air of anarchy seemed to metastasize across Midtown.
Just after 11, a group of looters approached Madison Jewelers on Broadway, where the glass storefront lay shattered, and forced open the store's metal gate. With the store alarm blaring, young men foraged inside and dozens of others rushed to the scene. When an unmarked police car with its lights on passed the scene, it paused briefly -- and then continued down 37th Street.
"This way! This way!" one looter yelled.
Minutes later, two police officers on bicycles sped toward the crowd, sending people fleeing down Broadway. The cops threw one man to the ground, but as they hand-tied him, another man in a gray sweatshirt pelted two large rocks at the officers before he was chased away.
An hour later, around 200 people flooded into Seventh Avenue chanting expletives about the curfew. As they approached two police vans, the cars pulled away -- prompting a wave of applause from the crowd.
"If you want to peacefully protest, stay inside!" one young man bellowed through a megaphone. "If you want to do whatever you want, stay out here."
When the group happened upon a New York-themed gift shop whose storefront had already been smashed open, they ransacked the store once again. As they tore through the merchandise, one person lobbed a Statue of Liberty figurine outside.
It landed, fractured, in the street.

Adidas Voices Solidarity With Protests While Closing Its Stores: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company, which relies on young black consumers, released an anti-racism statement on social media but shut its U.S. outlets because of protests across the country.
As protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody increased across the country last week, Adidas did what brands often do: It posted on Instagram, where the company's account has nearly 26 million followers.
"Together is how we move forward," one of the company's statements read, under the word "RACISM" crossed out.
Some followers praised the German sportswear retailer, reacting with clapping and heart-eyes emojis. Others noted that the post didn't mention Mr. Floyd or police brutality, containing mostly unspecific aphorisms.
"You did it adidas you stopped racism," one follower sarcastically replied.
Just as sportswear companies were emerging from an economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, they lurched toward another as hundreds of American cities erupted in protests against racism and police brutality over the weekend. An Adidas store in an upscale neighborhood of Los Angeles was looted, and the company closed its dozens of American stores, just two weeks after reopening some of them for the first time in months.
A spokeswoman for Adidas declined to comment beyond its post on Instagram.
Brands traditionally avoid hot-button political topics in their advertising and marketing, but in recent years that has become more difficult. Consumers from the younger generation want to see their values reflected in the brands they buy.
For sportswear companies like Adidas, that has been especially true during the presidency of Donald J. Trump. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, New Balance faced a backlash after expressing support for his trade policies. The company's shoes were then embraced by racists, who referred to them as the "Official Shoes of White People." Nike signed Colin Kaepernick, the N.F.L. quarterback who began kneeling during the pregame national anthem in protest of the treatment of black people by the police, to a new endorsement contract. It later pulled a pair of sneakers with an early version of the American flag after his input, infuriating conservatives.
Companies like Adidas and Nike have long paid black entertainers and athletes to pitch their products, and it is often black teenagers in the country's largest cities who determine which brands are fashionable and subsequently sell big in the white suburbs. This is a particular bone of contention for black employees at Adidas, a number of whom told The New York Times last year that they felt ignored and sometimes discriminated against by the company.
"In sportswear, a huge part of their consumer base, and even people who inform their brand and endorsers for their brand, is usually a lot of black people," said James Whitner, the owner of the Whitaker Group. The Whitaker Group owns a number of fashion and sneaker retailers focused on black consumers.
Adidas-sponsored basketball players like Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics participated in protests over the weekend, and another, the Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young, organized one on Monday. The company's highest-paid pitchman, however, is the rapper Kanye West, who has his own Yeezy line inside Adidas. Mr. West supports Mr. Trump, who has called protesters "terrorists."
For its part, Nike released a video advertisement that inverted its trademark "Just Do It" phrase. "Don't pretend there's not a problem in America" appeared in black-and-white text as somber piano music played.
"The intent behind the film was to serve as a catalyst to inspire action," said KeJuan Wilkins, a spokesman for Nike. "There is a deep issue in our society around racism and equalities, and we felt by putting that film out there that we could help encourage people to shape a better future."
Mr. Wilkins, who is black, said he had led the project with Adrienne Lofton, a black woman and a former Under Armour executive who joined Nike last year as a vice president of North American marketing.
Nike has been called hypocritical in the past for projecting progressive values through its marketing that it does not practice within the company, specifically in its treatment of women. Nike publicly supported the U.S. women's soccer team in its fight for equal pay at the same time that female employees and sponsored athletes said the company mistreated them.
In its most recent diversity and inclusion report, Nike said 56 percent of its employees in 2019, including those in its stores, were nonwhite or from "underrepresented groups." But just 21 percent of its vice presidents were nonwhite, up from 16 percent in 2017.
Mr. Whitner called for sportswear companies to increase investments in black communities, including through donations, education, and internship and mentorship programs, saying they have a responsibility to help those they profit from.
"Everyone understands the dollars of black Americans," Mr. Whitner said. "If you are willing to research the dollars of black America, how do you not have the time to research the plight?"

It was one small overlooked moment as the streets of America burned.
In downtown Dallas near the convention center, a protester screamed at a dozen uniformed officers. “How do you live with yourself?” the man yelled at them. “How can you work for something you know is wrong?”
Off to the side, standing near the officers, a member of the Dallas Police Department in civilian clothes and wearing a mask to protect herself from the coronavirus was crying.
It is a volatile time to be a police officer in America.
They have been attacked by protesters and they have also attacked protesters, fueling the anger against them. Some have been applauded nationwide after being caught on video shaking hands with demonstrators, hugging them, taking a knee, or marching alongside them to turn tense protests into parades of solidarity. Others have been disciplined, fired or charged after using excessive force on protesters, as their superiors — long criticized for reacting sluggishly, if at all, to misconduct — are now swiftly punishing the kind of heavy-handed tactics that have been commonplace during riots in decades past.
The message from the president is to dominate the streets with force. The message from many of their chiefs and mayors is to tolerate, connect and empathize. The message on the streets, at times, is that they are part of the problem. The message from the news media is watch what you say and do.
All of these messages have collided in real time as police tactics are analyzed and publicized on social media, as the response becomes increasingly federalized and as officers in several cities are pelted with bricks, shot at and rammed by drivers in vehicles.
In St. Louis on Monday night, four officers were struck by gunfire in a shootout between gunmen at a protest and the police. In Las Vegas, an officer was put on life support after he was shot as police forces tried to disperse crowds after being hit with bottles and rocks. In Buffalo, New York, the driver of an SUV sped through a line of law enforcement officers in riot gear, injuring two of them in an episode caught on video.
“We feel like we’re pawns in a game right now,” said a supervisor in a police department in the St. Louis region who asked that his name not be used in order to speak frankly about the job. “It’s almost like there’s an agenda and we’re being used on both sides, the left and the right, to further that agenda.”
The supervisor said it felt like a more dangerous time to be an officer than it did during the rioting in 2014 over the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri, a sentiment echoed by other law enforcement officials.
“In 2014, there were threats of violence, people said all kinds of things,” the supervisor said. “I never felt that nervous.”
Much of policing, like much of politics, is local. But the outrage over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis has upended that notion, inciting social unrest and violence for urban and suburban police departments across the country. It has been a challenge for officers, at a time when many are also confronting the coronavirus.
“These type of protests take a significant toll on an officer’s mental wellness, and they add so much stress,” said Manny Ramirez, a sergeant with the Fort Worth Police Department and the president of the police officers’ union. “This is Fort Worth, Texas, 1,000 miles away, but yet these officers have become targets for that rage.”
Ramirez, 35, was in a command post on Sunday when protesters began hurling frozen water bottles and rocks at officers. One officer was struck on the elbow with a projectile. Another broke his leg while chasing a looter. “There’s got to be some way to ensure that going forward we can have something constructive come out of this,” he said.
In Beverly Hills, California, on Tuesday, several hundred chanting protesters were being monitored by the city’s police officers, who closed Rodeo Drive and were flanked by reinforcements in SWAT tactical vehicles.
“I’ve gone home once in the last four days,” said a Los Angeles officer watching the crowd months after having the coronavirus. “My girlfriend had to drop off clothes so I could change. It’s been hell, for everybody. Monsters and Red Bull, that’s the only thing that’s keeping me up.”
As the world watches demonstrations unfold on television and social media, both the best and the worst of American law enforcement has been on display.
Protesters, both peaceful and violent, have been bruised and beaten by officers on the front lines. In Denver, a police officer was fired on Tuesday after posting a photo online of three officers in armored tactical gear with the caption, “Let’s start a riot.”
In Austin, Texas, a 20-year-old African American protester was in critical condition after he was shot in the head with a beanbag round fired by a police officer on Sunday. A protester standing next to the man had thrown objects at the police, and in response an officer struck the victim instead. Others hit by similar police-fired rounds include a woman giving medical assistance and a pregnant African American woman.
“I’m crushed,” the Austin police chief, Bryan Manley, said during a news conference Monday. “I’ve cried a few times today.”
At a time when tensions are volatile on the streets, such missteps do more than hurt a department’s image. In Richmond, Virginia, two officers were being treated for gunshot injuries. The shooting occurred hours after the Police Department apologized on Twitter to peaceful protesters who were hit with tear gas.
In many ways, the police response to what is happening on the streets illustrates a kind of post-Ferguson era of policing. Officers — not only chiefs but even the rank and file — have embraced the demonstrations and aligned themselves so much with protesters that they have been invited to march alongside them. In some places, chiefs have become more politically outspoken and more emotional than they have been in decades.
At a demonstration in Redlands, a Southern California suburb in San Bernardino County, protesters knelt and bowed their heads for an extended moment of silence, to represent the eight minutes and 46 seconds that the Minneapolis officer had his knee on Floyd’s neck. Among those who took a knee was Chris Catren, the Redlands police chief.
“It’s community policing 2.0,” Catren said.
“In policing, you don’t put a toe in the water,” he said. “You either dive in, or you don’t. When incidents like this happen, for officers all the way across the country, it tarnishes all the work that we’ve done and all the trust we’ve built up with our community, and that’s frustrating.”

WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders in Congress and a pair of Republicans on Tuesday condemned President Donald Trump for his response to protests around the country and in the capital, the day after peaceful demonstrators were gassed in front of the White House so he could pose for a photograph with a Bible.
The rare bipartisan rebukes reflected a broad sense of alarm at the president’s behavior as protests of police violence and racial discrimination reach a boiling point throughout the country. They followed a remarkable spectacle that unfolded Monday evening, when the police fired flash-bang explosions and tear gas and used officers on horseback to drive away peaceful protesters as Trump appeared in the Rose Garden and threatened to send the United States military into states where governors could not bring protests under control.
He then left the White House and, with Attorney General William Barr and other aides, crossed a park that had been cleared of demonstrators to have his picture taken holding the Bible outside a historic church that had been vandalized in the unrest.
“After the president’s reality show ended last night, while the nation nervously watched the chaos that engulfs us, President Trump probably laid in bed pleased with himself for descending another rung on the dictatorial ladder,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor Tuesday morning. “He probably wore out his remote control watching the clips of General Barr’s victory over the unarmed in the battle of Lafayette Square.”
He added: “It’s all so sad, so pathetic, so weak.”
On the other side of the Capitol, wielding her own Bible and quoting from the Book of Ecclesiastes, Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged the president to focus on “a time to heal,” adding that the aggressive scene that played out in Washington on Monday had “no place” in the nation’s capital.
“We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many other presidents and be a healer in chief,” Pelosi said, “and not a fanner of the flame.”
Their comments reflected a building sense of outrage at Trump among Democrats, who are pressing for quick action to address the excessive use of force and the killings of unarmed black Americans by the police. But at least two Republicans joined in the criticism of the president’s actions as well.
“There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property and no right to throw rocks at police,” Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the word of God as a political prop.”
His comments echoed those of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, who denounced the move in unequivocal terms during an event hosted by Politico.
“If your question is, ‘Should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo op?’ the answer is no,” Scott said.
But when Democrats moved to officially condemn Trump for the move, offering a symbolic resolution that also affirmed the rights of Americans to peacefully assemble and denounced rioters and looters, Republicans blocked the effort.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, said he objected because the resolution addressed neither justice for black Americans or “peace for our country in the face of looting.”
“Instead, it just indulges in the myopic obsession with President Trump that has come to define the Democratic side,” McConnell said.
McConnell then tried to pass his own resolution to condemn a long pattern of unjust police violence against black Americans, praise peaceful protesters, and condemn rioting, but Schumer objected, calling it insufficient because it failed to denounce Trump’s actions.
Many other Republicans refrained entirely on Tuesday from addressing Trump’s words and actions, and some offered support for the president, noting that protests had grown violent and, in some cases, given way to looting.
“We have to restore order,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters when asked about the president’s calls for military force. “This can’t go on. So hopefully, you know, the president talking that way will put a little spine in some of these governors that aren’t calling out the National Guard, to the extent that they need to to restore order.”
Johnson said he had not seen video of the police clearing protesters from outside the White House to make way for Trump.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, said the episode was “in the eye of the beholder.”
He offered a vague critique of Trump’s idea of inserting the military to rout protesters, saying: “I would prefer that these things be handled by the state and local authorities. You want to de-escalate, rather than escalate.”
Minutes before the scene unfolded Monday, Trump had threatened an “overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.” In the nation’s capital later Monday night, that warning became a reality, as military helicopters flew low over protesters breaking curfew in “show of force displays” and federal law enforcement officials continued to deploy flash grenades.
Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called Tuesday for Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, to testify before lawmakers about the potential deployments of U.S. military personnel to states.
“What I want to hear from them is: What role do they envision the United States military playing in dealing with the violence and the protests we are seeing in the cities?” Smith said.
Smith referred to comments made by Esper on a call led by Trump with the nation’s governors on Monday, in which the defense secretary used military language to describe the response to protests, telling governors, “We need to dominate the battle space.”
“Language like that is deeply concerning in terms of how the military could be used for domestic law enforcement,” Smith said.
Even moderate Democrats in conservative-leaning districts emphatically denounced Trump’s response to the protests in Washington, in a sign that there may be little sympathy for the president’s actions among their constituents. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a former CIA officer, called his response the type of action “undertaken by authoritarian regimes throughout the world.”
“I know this playbook,” Spanberger said, citing her national security background, “and I know the president’s actions are betraying the very foundation of the rule of law he purports to support — the U.S. Constitution.”
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the majority leader, said Tuesday that House leaders had asked the Congressional Black Caucus to take the lead on assembling a package of bills that would address police brutality, racial profiling and other misconduct in the coming days. He said the House would return to Washington to vote as soon as a package was ready for its consideration.
“This is a matter of great urgency, and we expect to act as soon as possible,” Hoyer said, adding that legislation would seek to “change policies so that these incidents that are happening on a regular basis stop occurring.”
“This can’t happen in America,” he said.
Hoyer said Trump’s actions Monday night might lead to a censure vote by the House, calling it “certainly an action worthy and appropriate to censure and to criticize,” though he cautioned that members had not yet discussed the idea.

Protests Draw Shoulder-to-Shoulder Crowds After Months of Virus Isolation [With graphic(s)]

CHICAGO — For days, Kate Dixon has been watching the videos of demonstrations from her home in a Denver suburb: the images of young people packed shoulder to shoulder, the crowds shouting in unison on downtown streets, the occasional détente between protester and police officer that ends in a hug.
“You want that to be a wonderful moment,” said Dixon, a stay-at-home mother who has been sewing face masks in her spare time. “But your heart just hurts at all the illness this could be causing.”
In the last week, the United States has abruptly shifted from one crippling crisis to the next. Most Americans had been under stay-at-home orders for months to slow the coronavirus pandemic, restrictions that were gradually eased throughout May, freeing people in many states to begin venturing back into shops and restaurants.
Then came Memorial Day in Minneapolis, when George Floyd, a black man, died after pleading that he could not breathe as a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck. His death has prompted cascading protests in hundreds of cities, where demonstrators have called for an end to police brutality and racist institutions.
Suddenly America no longer looks like a nation cooped up at home.
The demonstrations have spurred fears that they could cause a deadly resurgence of the coronavirus. And for those sympathetic to a growing movement, deciding whether to attend protests has been complicated: Some people have avoided them entirely, reasoning that the chance of contracting the coronavirus in a crowd is too high. Others have joined despite the risks.
“The police violence against black people — that’s a pandemic, too,” said Kelli Ann Thomas, a community organizer who joined protests in Miami. “People are willing to risk their lives, to risk their health, to show solidarity with black people.”
No one has studied the precise dynamics of how the virus may be transmitted under the mix of conditions that prevail at mass protests. And because of delays between exposure to the virus and the start of symptoms, and then hospitalizations and deaths, the effect of the protests on virus spread will not be known for several weeks.
Health experts know that the virus is far less likely to be spread outdoors than indoors. And masks reduce the chance of infected people transmitting the respiratory droplets that contain the virus.
But many uncertainties remain. Yelling, shouting and singing can increase how far those droplets are projected. Crowds and the length of time an uninfected person is near someone who is infected also increase the risk of transmission.
Protests have revealed a range of precautions, from people wearing tightly secured masks to others with no face covering. On Monday, a nurse’s assistant who works at a nursing home was among the protesters at the site where Floyd died in Minneapolis, showing up in a mask and scrubs.
Contagion was weighing on the mind of Jamie Schwesnedl in the first days of protests. Schwesnedl owns Moon Palace Books, down the street from a police station that was set on fire last weekend after demonstrators clashed with police.
Black people were already suffering from a disproportionate number of coronavirus infections; now many members of their communities are protesting the death of Floyd.
“The idea of getting a whole lot of people together to yell, which we know is one of the most effective ways to transmit the virus, and having that happen around a lot of people of color and neighborhoods and communities of color, is very stressful,” said Schwesnedl, who is white. “It just adds this whole stress of how this is going to impact the infection rates.”
In Denver, Tay Anderson, a protest leader and school board member, has been worried about the disparate effect of the coronavirus on black Colorado residents like himself. Thousands of people marched through Denver and laid down, shoulder to shoulder, on the lawn of the Capitol in silent demonstrations.
He put out a call on social media for all protesters to join him in getting tested for the coronavirus Saturday morning at the Pepsi Center, a sports and concert arena where Denver has been running free, large-scale testing.
“WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC,” he wrote on Twitter.
In Los Angeles, city leaders have expressed alarm that the protests could fuel the spread of the coronavirus, while at the same time voicing support for the rights of demonstrators to gather and saying that they shared in the outrage over the death of Floyd.
Mayor Eric Garcetti warned that the gatherings could become “superspreader events” — not unlike during the 1918 flu pandemic when, after the first wave of infections, some cities began holding parades and large gatherings that led to a second, more deadly wave.
Some of the city’s virus testing sites have had to be shut down briefly, and while jail populations had been reduced over concerns about the spread of the virus in tightly controlled institutions, they now are filling again after mass arrests.
Though the pandemic has slowed somewhat in recent weeks, the virus continues to infect thousands and kill hundreds every day. Many of the country’s big cities have been adding several hundred new cases every day. On Monday, nearly 1,000 new cases were identified in Los Angeles County, California; more than 500 in Cook County, Illinois; and more than 400 in New York City. In the county that includes Minneapolis, more than 1,000 new cases have been identified over the past week, and officials have urged protesters to seek coronavirus testing.
Epidemiologists said the protests would almost certainly lead to more cases of the virus. Large gatherings of people are known to have led to chains of transmission in other settings. And police tactics such as spraying tear gas, which causes people to cough; herding protesters into smaller areas for crowd control; and placing arrested individuals in buses, vans and holding cells also increase the risk of infection.
An aggregate model assembled by researchers at the University of Massachusetts projects that the nation will see between 5,000 to 7,000 deaths from COVID-19 each week over the next month.
But public health experts emphasized that police violence against black people in America also represents a public health crisis. The anger over economic, social and health disparities fueling the protests, health experts said, are reflected in sharply higher rates of coronavirus-related death and illness among black Americans. Several counseled a “harm reduction” approach that would allow people to join the demonstrations as safely as possible.
“Last week, all the news was about COVID; this week, all the news is about the protests,” said Eleanor Murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University School of Public Health. “But really, these are two pieces of the same conversation.’’
Yolanda Williams, host of the podcast “Parenting Decolonized," which focuses on parenting black children, said she has not attended protests in Little Rock, Arkansas, where she lives. She is a single mother of a toddler, and her area has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases.
But she had a message on her Facebook page for those among her followers who are white: You should be showing up.
“I know it’s scary, but if you are committed to dismantling white supremacy, it’s you that needs to be out there, en masse, protesting as loud for civil rights as you did for the Women’s March,” she said in the post.
In an interview Tuesday, Williams said she was trying to drive home the point that it is far riskier for black people to attend protests than it is for white people.
“The problem is, we are having to choose from either dying from COVID or dying from cops,” she said. “Put yourself on the line like we are doing every day. Put your body on the line.”
For many public health experts who have spent weeks advising policymakers and the public on how to reduce their risk of getting or inadvertently spreading the coronavirus, the mass demonstrations have forced a shift in perspective.
Tiffany Rodriguez, an epidemiologist who has rarely left her home since mid-March, said it was often impossible to maintain the recommended 6 feet of distance at the protest she attended in Boston on Sunday. But “understanding that police brutality is a public health epidemic,” she said she felt compelled to go.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s vow to “dominate” demonstrators protesting police brutality has mobilized the full might of federal law enforcement, from border agencies and the Drug Enforcement Administration to FBI hostage rescue teams, working alongside local law enforcement, the military police and the National Guard.
The extraordinary deployments have reached the streets of San Diego, Las Vegas and Buffalo, New York.
But nowhere is the show of force as strong as in Washington, where Trump is seeking to demonstrate his might by flooding the city’s downtown with agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Homeland Security Investigations, Customs and Border Protection and the Defense Department, turning the nation’s capital into a heavily armed federal fortress. Even Transportation Security Administration officers have been called out of the airports to help protect federal property in the “national capital region.”
“DHS and its partners will not allow anarchists, disrupters and opportunists to exploit the ongoing civil unrest to loot and destroy our communities,” said Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “While the department respects every American’s right to protest peacefully, violence and civil unrest will not be tolerated. We will control the situation and protect the American people and the homeland at any cost.”
In all, nearly a dozen federal agencies and components have joined in Trump’s effort to quell protests incited by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and ostensibly to put an end to rioting and looting — and determine whether anarchists and other extremist groups had infiltrated the protests.
But local officials say the federal response has gone beyond acceptable, verging on overkill. The mayor of the District of Columbia called it “shameful.” A Virginia county pulled its officers out of Washington rather than deploy alongside federal agents. The governor of Illinois said the federal presence had actually undercut efforts to restore law and order, while Texas said it needed no help from the U.S. military.
Regardless, Attorney General William Barr promised to deploy “even greater law enforcement resources” in Washington on Tuesday evening.
“I can’t remember the last time this number of federal agencies were brought together to try and deal with a large number of demonstrators,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a police research and policy organization. He said the rush of multiple federal forces into the city could be a recipe for “chaos.”
The tension is more evidence of a schism that has opened between federal and local governments — first over the pandemic and now over how to respond to protests provoked by a spate of killings of black people. Neither side has coordinated clearly with the other, and neither has been willing to take responsibility for some of the ugliest episodes between protesters and officers.
While mayors and governors express sympathy for the demonstrations, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have monitored the protests for domestic terrorist activity. The department said in a bulletin to law enforcement agencies that militia extremists and anarchists could use the protests to cause violence and mayhem, according to an official in possession of the document, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the memo.
The Justice Department said that it would deploy all of its forces, including hostage rescue teams and riots squads, and that it had given agents at the Drug Enforcement Administration the power to make arrests.
Customs and Border Protection said agents had arrest authority, including those on elite tactical teams that are preparing to deploy to cities and states.
Overnight Sunday, after protesters defaced the Treasury Department building and a part of St. John’s Church had caught on fire, administration officials decided it was essential to clear Lafayette Square and expand the amount of territory near the White House that was controlled by officers.
“President Trump directed Attorney General Barr to lead federal law enforcement efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia,” Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said on Monday.
To maintain control of a protest, the local police typically employ lines of officers to separate crowds and encourage uniformed officers to use discretion to de-escalate encounters with tense crowds, law enforcement experts said. But in Trump’s rush to assert dominance over the demonstrations, the local police on Monday night were joined by federal authorities who donned ballistic gear and carried riot shields. Military helicopters flew overhead.
At the request of the Justice Department, Customs and Border Protection dispatched border agents and tactical officers to cities throughout the country to assist the local police with the protests. The border agency’s air and marine operations branch, which uses aircrafts and drones, was directed to provide surveillance of the protests, including demonstrations in Detroit.
Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said in a tweet on Tuesday that the aircraft specialists were used in Buffalo to track people who hit officers with a vehicle.
Around 600 homeland security officials were deployed to the Washington area, including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement who found out about the assignment from an alert shortly before noon telling them to prepare to aid the local police.
The agency responsible for arresting and deporting unauthorized immigrants deployed “specialized teams” to major cities to help contract security officers in the Federal Protective Service, another homeland security agency, provide security at federal buildings.
The Secret Service was also directed to bolster protective shifts of uniformed officers at the White House.
But communication issues between the state and federal authorities seemed to come as quickly as each deployment. Washington’s mayor, Muriel E. Bowser, learned from neighboring local leaders that National Guard support was headed for Washington, and she resisted.
Hours after protesters in Lafayette Square were pepper-sprayed and rammed by federal authorities armed with riot shields, the Arlington County Board in suburban Northern Virginia ordered its police force — which had been helping to patrol the protests in Washington — to return, saying their mutual aid agreement had been “abused.”
When multiple federal agencies are rushed out to assist local law enforcement, “you can have chaos,” Wexler said. Each agency has different use-of-force policies and different deescalation training.
Eugene O’Donnell, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, agreed. “It’s like sending the firefighters in for a police call,” he said. “A lot of them are investigators. They’re not urban street cops.”
On Monday, video footage captured U.S. Park Police officers in riot gear delivering multiple blows to a news camera crew in Lafayette Square. Federal officials were shown pushing demonstrators over to make way for Trump’s photo opportunity in front of St. John’s.
For the next few hours, the protest remained largely peaceful as the local police allowed the demonstrators to march through the streets. Teams from the FBI and the DEA lined side streets. But shortly before 10 p.m., military helicopters lowered to rooftop level in the Chinatown area of Washington. Around the same time, some storefronts were shattered by protesters.
The helicopters sent gusts of dust into the air, causing one tree to split and nearly hit bystanders. Demonstrators fled a couple of blocks where they were met by authorities who began to toss what appeared to be smoke canisters.
Community “police like to go out with a soft approach,” Wexler said.
“They wear a regular uniform. They don’t put on the heavy gear, the riot gear. They keep that in reserve,” he continued. “What they recognized is if you bring out people in riot gear to begin with, you’re basically sending this message.”
That message, he said, is: “We expect trouble or we don’t trust you.”
That was not the approach of federal law enforcement officers who surrounded dozens of protesters late Monday on a residential street and fired chemicals at them, a moment that was photographed and shared by residents. A stranger who heard their cries for help let them shelter in his home until the city’s curfew lifted, while law enforcement waited outside to arrest them.
To Trump and Barr, the raucous night was a success.
Barr called Monday evening “a more peaceful night in the District of Columbia.”
Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter to the Secret Service director, James Murray, criticizing the agency for using what he described as tear gas.
“I write to you stunned, disturbed and furious at the sight of federal authorities tear-gassing peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park, outside the White House, last night, in order to clear the way for the president to walk over and hold a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church,” Thompson wrote. “It is shameful.”
When asked who decided to use rubber bullets and chemicals to clear clergy members from the patio of St. John’s and peaceful protesters from the park, all of the federal agencies contacted declined to answer.

WASHINGTON — In a rare break with President Donald Trump, multiple Senate Republicans on Tuesday faulted his response to civil unrest around the nation, rejecting his move to crack down on demonstrators and rushing to express sympathy with black Americans who have taken to the streets to protest police brutality against them.
The day after Trump threatened to unleash the U.S. military to rout protesters around the nation, the reactions of Republicans — some condemning the president directly, others carefully suggesting that they held a different view — underscored the politically precarious choice they face between endorsing the president’s divisive approach or breaking with him and risking a party backlash just months before the November elections.
“There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property and no right to throw rocks at police,” Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement. “But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the word of God as a political prop.”
Sasse was referring to the remarkable spectacle that unfolded Monday evening when police fired flash-bang explosive devices and tear gas and used officers on horseback to drive away peaceful protesters outside the White House. Minutes later, Trump strode out and marched across Lafayette Square to brandish a bible outside St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been damaged in a fire during unrest the night before.
Sasse’s comments echoed those of Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, who denounced the move in unequivocal terms during an event hosted by Politico.
“If your question is, ‘Should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo op?’ the answer is no,” Scott said.
Those rebukes, and much harsher criticism of the president’s actions by Democrats in the House and Senate, reflected a rising sense of alarm at Trump’s behavior as protests of police violence and racial discrimination reached a boiling point after the death of an African American man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody.
With Democrats demanding a legislative response to the issues underlying Floyd’s death, Republicans are facing increasing pressure to back up their critical statements against the president and expressions of concern about persistent racism with something tangible.
“We are going to propose and push for bold action,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday. “What matters is that we respond to a national wave of unrest with action.”
This was hardly the first time Republicans on Capitol Hill found themselves pressed to distinguish between their views and those of a president who in times of trouble often seeks the affirmation of his most conservative supporters.
From the moment he took office, Republicans have been called upon to respond to the president’s loaded statements, hyperbolic tweets and scathing criticisms of others as well as his dealings with foreign governments and his positions on harsh immigration measures, trade, congressional authority and other matters. Most Republicans have typically demurred, not wanting to provoke a caustic Twitter attack from the president or alienate party voters devoted to Trump.
But the current situation may be the most volatile for Republicans yet, with Americans — already enduring the twin public health and economic calamities of the coronavirus pandemic — almost uniformly outraged at the case of Floyd, whose brutal death after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes was captured on video. Many Americans in both parties are increasingly unsettled by both the violence stemming from the protests and Trump’s demands that governors and local authorities take a harder line.
With their hold on the Senate to be decided in an election five months away, Republicans will need the votes of suburban and independent voters if they hope to retain seats in states such as Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina and Maine. In a sign of how lawmakers view the political landscape, moderate Democrats in conservative-leaning districts emphatically rejected Trump’s response to the protests in Washington, suggesting that they see little sympathy for the president’s approach among their constituents.
Despite Trump anointing himself “your president of law and order,” many Senate Republicans have adopted a much less bellicose attitude, emphasizing the need to get at the root causes of the upheaval — racial discrimination and a well-established pattern of excessive use of force by the police — rather than targeting protesters.
“You can understand the outrage,” Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, said Tuesday about the national anguish over Floyd’s killing. McConnell, whose hometown, Louisville, was in turmoil over Floyd’s death and recent incidents involving police in Kentucky, said the grievances were legitimate and he did not dispute the role racism played in the events.
“There is no question that there is residual racism in America,” he told reporters. “No question about that. It has been a longtime dilemma, and we all wish we could get to a better place.”
But when Schumer tried to force action on a symbolic resolution to condemn Trump’s actions, McConnell objected, chiding Democrats for pushing a measure that he said addressed neither justice for black Americans nor “peace for our country in the face of looting.”
“Instead, it just indulges in the myopic obsession with President Trump that has come to define the Democratic side,” McConnell said.
Still, other Republicans joined in the criticism of Trump.
“To me at a time like this, the president ought to be trying to calm the nation,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is facing a difficult reelection race in a state Trump plans to visit this week. She said she found it “painful” to watch peaceful protesters subjected to tear gas so he could go to a church he had visited just once before, and added that Trump “came across as unsympathetic and as insensitive to the rights of people to peacefully protest.”
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told reporters that Monday’s events did not reflect “the America that I know.”
“I don’t think militarization is the answer to the anxiety, the fear, the distrust, the oppression we feel right now,” Murkowski said. “It is not the response.”
Even Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s chief Republican defenders, said he had been flummoxed by the president’s actions.
“I don’t know what the purpose of the trip was,” Graham said. “I do know that last night was a bad night and we need less bad nights.”
Not all Republicans agreed. Some fell back on their practiced defense, saying they could not make a judgment because they had not seen the incident, while others defended the president, noting that some of the protests had grown violent and given way to looting.
“We have to restore order,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “This can’t go on. So hopefully, you know, the president talking that way will put a little spine in some of these governors that aren’t calling out the National Guard, to the extent that they need to to restore order.”
Johnson claimed not to have seen protesters being violently driven back so that Trump could walk to the church, and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said the episode had been “in the eye of the beholder.”
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, commended Trump, saying, “I’m glad the president led by going to St. John’s Church.” It was the protesters, not the president, who had abused power, Cruz said.
Democrats moved quickly to try to take political advantage of the public mood.
“It’s time for John Katko to find the backbone to state clearly whether he stands with President Trump or the clergy denouncing his tear gassing of Americans peacefully protesting,” the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a statement, singling out a third-term moderate Republican from New York who is facing a difficult reelection race in a district Hillary Clinton won in 2016. The committee sent out identical statements about roughly a dozen other endangered House Republicans.
Democrats said they were skeptical that Republicans would be willing to challenge Trump too aggressively. They said they suspected that Republicans would treat the issue as they had gun control in the past, promising action immediately after mass killings but letting the issue pass quietly without action once the uproar subsided.
But Democrats made clear that they did not intend to let the issue go.
“I’ve heard words from people on both sides of the aisle, speaking toward the injustice of racism that exists in our country — I’ve heard words,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in a passionate floor speech. “It’s on us in this body to do something.”

‘It Was a Disgrace’: De Blasio and Police Chief Faulted Over Looting [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio and his top police official faced sharp criticism on Tuesday and vowed to alter their tactics after thousands of officers were unable to prevent bands of looters from breaking into businesses across the city, including Macy’s flagship store in Herald Square and other well-known stores in Midtown Manhattan.
Even some senior members of the department privately acknowledged that the police had been overwhelmed by the number of looting incidents and the logistics of keeping ahead of the steady stream of reported break-ins for a second night.
“The radio was nonstop all night with cops asking for backup,” said one police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Much of the help, the official added, never arrived, allowing looters to move on to other targets.
De Blasio and his police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, acknowledged that the department’s response to the turmoil Monday was flawed and that widespread looting had taken place as many officers were dispatched to oversee what turned out to be largely peaceful demonstrations.
City Councilman Rory Lancman, the chairman of the Committee on the Justice System, said the police had failed to stop crimes from being committed and had been overly aggressive in controlling legitimate protest. “The buck falls squarely with the mayor — it’s his police force,” Lancman said.
While it remained unclear precisely how the police planned to retool their approach, de Blasio said he would impose an 8 p.m. curfew Tuesday — three hours earlier than Monday — and called on local clergy and community leaders to take an increased role in protecting their own neighborhoods.
He also promised to re-examine the strategy his police department has used to deal with the worst public chaos to hit New York since the citywide blackout of 1977. The department issued a memo canceling all days off for its officers.
“There’s a lot of things that have to be done better, a lot of things have to be fixed,” de Blasio said. “And that’s the work we will do.”
The vast majority of the protests across New York City on Monday were peaceful. But throughout the late evening, an enormous deployment of 8,000 officers — nearly a quarter of the department — was unable to contain the bands of looters or to stop them from smashing windows and breaking into stores that ranged from mom-and-pop shops to retail giants like Macy’s and Bergdorf Goodman.
Over again and again, the police responded to emergency calls, but even though they made more than 700 arrests, they struggled to secure the streets and get ahead of the vandals. One video showed a roiling crowd gathered in front of Macy’s, on 34th Street, with enough time to rip through a plywood barricade and swarm into the store before the police responded.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday the police had failed, but resisted calls to replace them with the National Guard. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.”
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly clashed with governors and mayors over his response to George Floyd’s death, urged Cuomo to send in National Guardsmen. “NYC was ripped to pieces,” the president said on Twitter.
There has been violence and looting in several cities across the country for a week, triggered by the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. One officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, has been charged with murder in the case.
Like other municipal officials, de Blasio and Shea have said that the police in New York have done their best to grapple with a complicated and quickly changing crisis, trying to balance respect for peaceful protest with protecting lives and property — all in the middle of a pandemic.
“The complexities our officers deal with are unimaginable,” de Blasio said.
But Ritchie Torres, a Bronx city councilman, said the police were slow to respond not only to the disturbances in Manhattan, but also to numerous reports of looting and arson on Fordham Road, the largest commercial district in his own borough.
“The administration assured me the situation was under control, but when I saw it for myself, it was anything but,” Torres said in an interview Tuesday. “The city was largely reactive — almost blindsided. Then, when the police did respond, their presence was insufficient to get a grip on the situation.”
Cuomo said he would not deploy the National Guard, but he echoed Torres and others who were baffled that one of the largest and most sophisticated police departments in the world had been outmanned or outfoxed by looters.
From dusk on Monday until well after dark, reporters and ordinary residents posting on social media observed repeated incidents of the police either rushing past stores being looted or arriving at them too late to quell the mayhem.
The situation was apparently the same at the North Face store on Fifth Avenue and an Urban Outfitters branch in Herald Square. Small bands of young people, largely dressed in black, smashed through windows, making off with armloads of merchandise. Sometimes, officers were in the area and failed to promptly respond. At other times, they were nowhere to be seen.
Asked about these incidents Tuesday, de Blasio pushed back firmly, saying he had seen “many, many police officers taking action to stop things.”
“We do not allow looting, period,” he said. “Anyone who is looting is a criminal.”
But the mayor acknowledged that police officials sent the bulk of their officers on Monday to SoHo, where most of the disturbances were on Sunday, failing to anticipate the troubles further north in Midtown. He also said some officers who may have sped by crimes in progress were most likely hurrying to answer other calls.
Joining him at a news conference, Shea noted that officers in New York are trained to preserve life over property and that, at least so far, there had been no casualties during the past chaotic week.
“We’ve had a very difficult, by anyone’s definition, five days of literally straight protest in the middle of the pandemic, dealing with everything, including the kitchen sink,” he said. “It has not been perfect by any stretch of the imagination.”
Some among his rank and file agreed. One officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with reporters, called his colleagues’ tactics “a disaster,” comparing the city on Monday night to “a war zone.”
The senior police official who spoke anonymously said de Blasio and Shea were overly optimistic about the demonstrations and had failed to foresee that the largely peaceful protests could quickly devolve into vandalism, looting and violence. The official also noted the police communications systems became overburdened as commanders pleaded for backup at the same time.
“I think they were stretched thin,” he said. “I think the volume was even greater than the night before.”
Chief Terence Monahan, the highest-ranking uniformed officer, told The New York Post on Tuesday that he was outraged by Cuomo’s criticism and defended the department’s handling of the unrest.
“I’m watching my men and women out there dealing with stuff that no cop should ever have to deal with — bricks, bottles, rocks,” Monahan said.
In the evening, a spokesman for the governor walked back parts of Cuomo’s remarks about the police, saying he respected the rank and file but questioned de Blasio’s management and deployment of the 36,000 officers. “Why isn’t at least half of the force on the streets protecting public safety with looting going on across the city?” the aide, Richard Azzopardi, said.
Some decisions departed from past practice, experts on crowd control said. The city did not deploy plainclothes anti-crime officers during the Manhattan demonstrations to spot people throwing bricks or committing other crimes, a city official said. Mounted units were not used for crowd control either, and the demonstrators were allowed to roam relatively freely rather than being channeled onto certain routes.
Some officers blamed the ensuing chaos on indecisive leadership. “It seems like we have lost control,” said one city detective, also speaking on the condition of anonymity. “It’s apparent that there’s no direction.”
Another detective, who, like his colleagues, spoke on the condition that he not be named, said he did not believe that orders had been issued for officers to refrain from confronting looters. But he said officers had been instructed to “keep yourself safe,” and may have waited in some cases to engage with looters.
“It’s dangerous, especially if you don’t have a lot of police in the immediate area,” he said.
Brian Higgins, an expert on crowd control who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the police department should not be playing catch-up with looters a week into the demonstrations.
Many looters, he noted, seemed to have gone in and out of marquee stores with a giddy disregard for the consequences. The police, Higgins said, were either nowhere to be seen or appeared to have been ordered to stand down.
“Last night the NYPD took it on the chin,” he said.

El anuncio del presidente estadounidense en Twitter atrajo nueva atención a los manifestantes antifascistas, a los que culpó por incitar a la violencia en las protestas.

En su búsqueda de culpables por las protestas que han sacudido el país, el presidente Donald Trump dijo el 31 de mayo que Estados Unidos designaría a antifa como organización terrorista. La denominación antifa cobija a activistas de extrema izquierda antifascistas.
Los críticos del presidente señalaron, sin embargo, que Estados Unidos no tiene una ley de terrorismo interno y que antifa, una contracción de “antifascista”, no es una organización con un líder, una estructura definida o funciones determinadas para sus miembros.
Más bien, antifa es un movimiento de activistas cuyos seguidores comparten filosofía y tácticas. Han dado a conocer su presencia en protestas en todo el país en los últimos años, incluida la manifestación “Unite the Right” en Charlottesville, Virginia, en 2017.
¿Quiénes son los miembros de antifa?
Es imposible saber cuántas personas se consideran integrantes. Sus seguidores reconocen que el movimiento es reservado, no tiene líderes oficiales y está organizado en células locales autónomas. También es solo uno dentro de una constelación de movimientos de activistas que se han reunido en los últimos años para oponerse a la extrema derecha.
Los miembros de antifa hacen campaña contra acciones que consideran autoritarias, homofóbicas, racistas o xenófobas. Aunque antifa no está afiliado a otros movimientos de izquierda —y a veces es visto como una distracción por otros organizadores— sus miembros a veces trabajan con otras redes activistas locales que se están uniendo en torno a los mismos temas, como el movimiento Occupy o Black Lives Matter.
[Aquí puedes ver fotos de la sexta noche de protestas en ciudades de todo Estados Unidos.]
¿Cuáles son sus objetivos?
Los partidarios generalmente buscan evitar que lo que ven como grupos fascistas, racistas y de extrema derecha tengan una plataforma para promover sus puntos de vista, argumentando que la demostración pública de esas ideas lleva a atacar a las personas marginadas, incluyendo minorías raciales, mujeres y miembros de la comunidad LGBTQ.
“El argumento es que el fascismo anti militante constituye inherentemente defensa propia, por la violencia históricamente documentada que los fascistas plantean, especialmente a las personas marginadas”, dijo Mark Bray, profesor de historia en la Universidad de Rutgers y autor de Antifa: el manual antifascista .
Muchos organizadores de antifa también participan en formas más pacíficas de organización comunitaria, pero creen que usar la violencia está justificado por su punto de vista de que si los grupos racistas o fascistas pueden organizarse libremente, “inevitablemente resultará en violencia contra las comunidades marginadas”, dijo Bray, cuya defensa del movimiento antifascista provocó críticas y generó apoyo en el Dartmouth College cuando era profesor allí.
¿Cuándo comenzó el movimiento?
Aunque el diccionario Merriam-Webster dice que la palabra “antifa” se usó por primera vez en 1946 y se tomó prestada de una frase alemana que indicaba una oposición al nazismo, más personas comenzaron a unirse al movimiento en Estados Unidos después de la elección de 2016 de Trump, para contrarrestar la amenaza que creían que representaba la llamada derecha alternativa (o alt right en inglés), dijo Bray.
Uno de los primeros grupos en Estados Unidos en usar el nombre fue Rose City Antifa, que dice que fue fundado en 2007 en Portland, Oregón. Tiene un gran número de seguidores en redes sociales, donde comparte noticias y a veces tratan de revelar las identidades o datos personales de figuras de la derecha.
El movimiento antifa ganó más visibilidad en 2017 después de una serie de eventos que pusieron de relieve a los manifestantes antifascistas, incluido el puñetazo a un destacado miembro de la alt right ; la cancelación de un evento de un escritor de derecha en la Universidad de California, Berkeley; y su confrontación con manifestantes nacionalistas blancos en Charlottesville, que se volvió violenta.
¿Qué distingue a antifa de otros grupos de protesta?
Bray dijo que los grupos antifa a menudo usan tácticas similares a las de los grupos anarquistas, como vestirse de negro y usar máscaras. Los grupos también tienen ideologías superpuestas, ya que ambos a menudo critican el capitalismo y buscan desmantelar las estructuras de autoridad, incluidas las fuerzas policiales.
¿Cuál ha sido la reacción de políticos y otras figuras?
El movimiento ha sido ampliamente criticado entre la corriente principal de izquierda y derecha. Después de las protestas en Berkeley, California, en agosto de 2017, la presidenta de la Cámara Baja, Nancy Pelosi, denunció “las acciones violentas de personas que se hacen llamar antifa” y dijo que deberían ser arrestadas.
Las publicaciones y los políticos conservadores habitualmente critican a los partidarios de antifa, de quienes dicen buscan bloquear la expresión pacífica de puntos de vista conservadores. Estas críticas apuntan a momentos en los cuales los supuestos miembros de antifa ha sido acusados de golpear a los seguidores de Trump.
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, una profesora de historia en la New York University que estudia el fascismo, dijo que le preocupaba que las tácticas de antifa pudieran alimentar lo que, según ella, eran falsas equivalencias que buscaban equiparar la violencia de la izquierda con los ataques de la derecha, como el asesinato de un manifestante en Charlottesville por un hombre que había expresado puntos de vista supremacistas blancos.
“Lanzar un batido de leche no es equivalente a matar a alguien, pero debido a que la gente en el poder está aliada con la derecha, cualquier provocación, cualquier disidencia contra la violencia de derecha, fracasa”, dijo la profesora Ben-Ghiat en una entrevista el año pasado.
Entre 2010 y 2016, el 53 por ciento de los ataques terroristas en Estados Unidos fueron realizados por extremistas: el 35 por ciento por extremistas de derecha y el 12 por ciento por extremistas de izquierda o ambientalistas, según un consorcio liderado por la Universidad de Maryland que estudia el terrorismo.
La militancia de la izquierda puede “convertirse en una justificación de aquellos en el poder y sus aliados en la derecha para tomar medidas enérgicas”, dijo la profesora Ben-Ghiat. “En estas situaciones, la izquierda, o antifa, se colocan históricamente en situaciones imposibles”.

WASHINGTON — With about an hour to go before a citywide curfew was set to take effect Monday, demonstrators outside the White House were caught by surprise as throngs of police officers in riot gear spilled out from the northeastern corner of Lafayette Square, deploying force to cut a path across the street toward St. John’s Episcopal Church.
Moments later, out of sight of many of the protesters who had been driven back, President Donald Trump walked past the church steps and produced a Bible.
Standing outside the church, which had been damaged and boarded up after days of demonstrations against police brutality, Trump struck different poses, displaying the book for cameras, ostensibly upside-down at times.
“Is that your Bible?” a reporter asked. “It’s a Bible,” Trump replied.
The president said nothing else about the significance of the site or the circumstances of his appearance before walking back toward the White House. But the display caused immediate consternation, not only because of the tense, political backdrop just feet away, but also because of Trump’s curious and at times confounding remarks about the Bible and his relationship with the text.
The president has offered only limited glimpses into the role Christianity has played in his upbringing and adult life. He was raised Presbyterian and has cited the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, a pastor and the author of “The Power of Positive Thinking,” as one of his earliest influences. He has said he attends church in observance of major holidays like Christmas and Easter, and has often named the Bible as his favorite book (though when pressed, he has also named some of his own books).
When Trump was sworn in as president, he joined a handful of presidents who took the oath of office on two bibles. One of them was a gift from his mother given two days before his ninth birthday, which Trump has kept since 1955.
But at times, the president’s conversations about his faith have betrayed an understanding of the Bible that religious scholars and leaders have described as limited or distorted.
In an interview with Bloomberg Politics in 2015, Trump demurred when asked to explain which Bible verses he counted among his favorites.
“I wouldn’t want to get into it because to me that’s very personal,” he said. “You know when I talk about the Bible, it’s very personal. So I don’t want to get into verses.”
When one of his interviewers tried to broaden the question — “Are you an Old Testament guy or a New Testament guy?” — Trump replied: “Probably equal. I think it’s just an incredible — the whole Bible is incredible.”
When asked about his favorite biblical teaching on other occasions, Trump has given different answers. Three months later in September 2015, he cited a Book of Proverbs passage about never “bending to envy” that scholars have said does not exist. Asked again in April 2016, Trump pointed to the Old Testament teaching of “an eye for an eye,” which he said resonated with his view that the United States had been taken advantage of by rivals.
Giving an address at Liberty University in January 2016, Trump drew laughter with an errant reference to “Two Corinthians,” a commonly quoted chapter properly known as “Second Corinthians” to adherents.
The president has also been inconsistent in his own assessment of his biblical knowledge.
On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump told a crowd in Nevada, “Nobody reads the Bible more than me.” But in December, Trump offered a different view at a White House Hanukkah reception, lightheartedly imagining the evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress’ impression of him: “He may not be the greatest Christian I’ve ever seen. He may not know the Bible quite as well as the rest of us. In fact, he may not know it very well at all.”
Jeffress on Monday defended Trump’s appearance at St. John’s against critics, including the bishop who oversees the church, saying that God “hates lawlessness,” according to a report in The Atlantic. The bishop, Mariann Edgar Budde, accused Trump of appropriating religious symbols to deflect criticism in a series of interviews Tuesday.
Other faith leaders have also suggested in the past that some of Trump’s actions and crasser remarks do not square with Christian values. During the 2016 presidential primary, Pope Francis implied that Trump was “not Christian,” given his remarks about Mexican immigrants and other groups that the pope framed as incompatible with Scripture. In December, a number of religious leaders condemned a remark Trump made at a rally suggesting that Rep. Debbie Dingell’s late husband, John D. Dingell Jr., was “looking up” from hell. And in February, the president invited criticism for using an address at the National Prayer Breakfast to attack the faith of political rivals.
However, many of Trump’s less conventional acts surrounding the Bible have often been accepted and even celebrated by evangelicals. When critics pounced after Trump passed out signed copies of the Bible to survivors of a hurricane in Alabama, many faith leaders quickly pointed out that several former presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, had signed Bibles as well.
While Trump’s actual reading of Scripture may be subject to debate, the president has said he has plenty of Bibles on hand, as he has maintained a personal collection over the years.
“I get sent Bibles by a lot of people,” Trump said in an interview with CBN News in 2015. “So actually I store them, and keep them, and sometimes give them away to other people, but I do get sent a lot of Bibles.”

‘It Was a Disgrace’: De Blasio and Police Official Faulted Over Looting [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio and his top police official faced sharp criticism Tuesday and vowed to alter their tactics after thousands of officers were unable to prevent bands of looters from breaking into businesses across the city, including Macy’s flagship store in Herald Square and other well-known stores in midtown Manhattan.
Even some senior members of the department privately acknowledged that the police had been overwhelmed by the number of looting incidents and the logistics of keeping ahead of the steady stream of reported break-ins for a second night.
“The radio was nonstop all night with cops asking for backup,” said one police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Much of the help, the official added, never arrived, allowing looters to move on to other targets.
De Blasio and his police commissioner, Dermot Shea, acknowledged that the department’s response to the turmoil Monday was flawed and that widespread looting had taken place as many officers were dispatched to oversee what turned out to be largely peaceful demonstrations.
City Councilman Rory Lancman, the chairman of the Committee on the Justice System, said the police had both failed to stop crimes from being committed and been overly aggressive in controlling legitimate protest. “The buck falls squarely with the mayor — it’s his police force,” Lancman said.
While it remained unclear precisely how the police planned to retool their approach, de Blasio said he would impose an 8 p.m. curfew Tuesday — three hours earlier than Monday’s — and called on local clergy and community leaders to take an increased role in protecting their own neighborhoods.
He also promised to re-examine the strategy his police department has used to deal with the worst public chaos to hit New York since the citywide blackout of 1977. The department issued a memo canceling all days off for its officers.
“There’s a lot of things that have to be done better, a lot of things have to be fixed,” de Blasio said. “And that’s the work we will do.”
The vast majority of the protests across New York City on Monday were peaceful. But throughout the late evening, an enormous deployment of 8,000 officers — nearly a quarter of the department — was unable to contain the bands of looters or to stop them from smashing windows and breaking into stores that ranged from mom-and-pop shops to retail giants like Macy’s and Bergdorf Goodman.
Over again and again, the police responded to emergency calls, but even though they made more than 700 arrests, they struggled to secure the streets and get ahead of the vandals. One video showed a roiling crowd gathered in front of Macy’s, on 34th Street, with enough time to rip through a plywood barricade and swarm into the store before the police responded.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday the police had failed but resisted calls to replace them with the National Guard. “The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.”
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly clashed with governors and mayors over his response to George Floyd’s death, urged Cuomo to send in National Guardsmen. “NYC was ripped to pieces,” the president said on Twitter.
There has been violence and looting in several cities across the country for a week, triggered by the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. One officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, has been charged with murder in the case.
Like other municipal officials, de Blasio and Shea have said that the police in New York have done their best to grapple with a complicated and quickly changing crisis, trying to balance respect for peaceful protest with protecting lives and property — all in the middle of a pandemic.
“The complexities our officers deal with are unimaginable,” de Blasio said.
Ritchie Torres, a Bronx city councilman, said the police were slow to respond not only to the disturbances in Manhattan but also to numerous reports of looting and arson on Fordham Road, the largest commercial district in his own borough.
“The administration assured me the situation was under control, but when I saw it for myself, it was anything but,” Torres said in an interview Tuesday. “The city was largely reactive — almost blindsided. Then, when the police did respond, their presence was insufficient to get a grip on the situation.”
Cuomo said he would not deploy the National Guard, but he echoed Torres and others who were baffled that one of the largest and most sophisticated police departments in the world had been outmanned or outfoxed by looters.
From dusk on Monday until well after dark, reporters and ordinary residents posting on social media observed repeated incidents of the police either rushing past stores being looted or arriving at them too late to quell the mayhem.
The situation was apparently the same at the North Face store on Fifth Avenue and an Urban Outfitters branch in Herald Square. Small bands of young people, largely dressed in black, smashed through windows, making off with armloads of merchandise. Sometimes, officers were in the area and failed to promptly respond. At other times, they were nowhere to be seen.
Asked about these incidents Tuesday, de Blasio pushed back firmly, saying he had seen “many, many police officers taking action to stop things.”
“We do not allow looting, period,” he said. “Anyone who is looting is a criminal.”
But the mayor acknowledged that police officials sent the bulk of their officers on Monday to SoHo, where most of the disturbances were on Sunday, failing to anticipate the troubles further north in midtown. He also said some officers who may have sped by crimes in progress were most likely hurrying to answer other calls.
Joining him at a news conference, Shea noted that officers in New York are trained to preserve life over property and that, at least so far, there had been no casualties during the past chaotic week.
“We’ve had a very difficult, by anyone’s definition, five days of literally straight protest in the middle of the pandemic, dealing with everything, including the kitchen sink,” he said. “It has not been perfect by any stretch of the imagination.”
Some among his rank and file agreed. One officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with reporters, called his colleagues’ tactics “a disaster,” comparing the city on Monday night to a “a war zone.”
The senior police official who spoke anonymously said de Blasio and Shea were overly optimistic about the demonstrations and had failed to foresee that the largely peaceful protests could quickly devolve into vandalism, looting and violence. The official also noted the police communications systems became overburdened as commanders pleaded for backup at the same time.
“I think they were stretched thin,” he said. “I think the volume was even greater than the night before.”
Chief Terence Monahan, the highest-ranking uniformed officer, told the New York Post on Tuesday that he was outraged by Cuomo’s criticism and defended the department’s handling of the unrest.
“I’m watching my men and women out there dealing with stuff that no cop should ever have to deal with — bricks, bottles, rocks,” Monahan said.
Some decisions departed from past practice, experts on crowd control said. The city did not deploy plainclothes anti-crime officers during the Manhattan demonstrations to spot people throwing bricks or committing other crimes, a city official said. Mounted units were not used for crowd control either, and the demonstrators were allowed to roam relatively freely rather than being channeled onto certain routes.
Some officers blamed the ensuing chaos on indecisive leadership. “It seems like we have lost control,” said one city detective, also speaking on the condition of anonymity. “It’s apparent that there’s no direction.”
Another detective, who, like his colleagues, spoke on the condition that he not be named, said he did not believe that orders had been issued for officers to refrain from confronting looters. But he said officers had been instructed to “keep yourself safe” and may have waited in some cases to engage with looters.
“It’s dangerous, especially if you don’t have a lot of police in the immediate area,” he said.
Brian Higgins, an expert on crowd control who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the police department should not be playing catch-up with looters a week into the demonstrations.
Many looters, he noted, seemed to have gone in and out of marquee stores with a giddy disregard for the consequences. The police, Higgins said, either were nowhere to be seen or appeared to have been ordered to stand down.
“Last night the NYPD took it on the chin,” he said.

NEW YORK — It was still a few hours before New York City would fall under a historic curfew on Monday night, but Mayor Bill de Blasio could already see that it was not working.
Demonstrators had been amassing for several days to protest the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The 11 p.m. cutoff Monday effectively pushed peaceful protesters off the streets, but it seemed to do little to deter those who looted large swaths of Midtown Manhattan and a slice of the Bronx.
If anything, the curfew seemed to cause them to start earlier.
As a result, the mayor decided to move the start time of the curfew to 8 p.m., announcing his decision in an interview on NY1. By Tuesday morning, de Blasio said he would extend that 8 p.m. curfew, New York City’s first since World War II, through Sunday night.
The decision to institute the curfew was laden with political and strategic considerations, and once again opened a window into the fraught relationship between the mayor and his fellow Democrat, Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
But it also revealed the willingness of state and city leaders to consider extraordinary measures — a solution of some kind to a level of pandemonium on city streets that longtime New York leaders said had no recent parallel.
“There’s nobody alive today in law enforcement — and I’ve been around since the late ’60s — nobody has seen anything like this in this country,” said William Bratton, de Blasio’s first police commissioner.
There were riots in the 1960s, “but it was nowhere near what was happening in New York City now,” said Richard Ravitch, 86, a former New York state lieutenant governor.
Sid Davidoff, now one of the city’s top lobbyists, was a personal aide to Mayor John Lindsay the night Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Even that tragedy, he said, as well as the unrest it prompted, does not compare to what he is seeing today.
“It wasn’t as angry,” said Davidoff, who has also advised de Blasio. “It was mourning.”
It is not at all clear, however, that the earlier curfew will deter widespread crime or better empower the police to restore order to areas targeted by looters. Among the many doubters are Bratton, who described curfews as “symbolic,” and Donovan Richards, a Queens councilman who chairs the City Council’s public safety committee. Richards worried that the curfew enforcement will fall most heavily on essential workers of color.
“My father is a commercial cleaner,” Richards said. “He works up to 11 p.m. Someone like him will have to deal with a curfew — a black man in the middle of Manhattan. I certainly have concerns.”
The last time New York City was under curfew was in February 1945. Fiorello LaGuardia was mayor. Franklin D. Roosevelt was president. The Allied forces had just bombed Dresden, Germany, and the United States was facing a coal shortage. The director of war mobilization imposed a nationwide midnight curfew on all “places of entertainment.” It lasted until May.
Seventy-five years and 10 mayors later — as late-night violence hijacked otherwise peaceful demonstrations, as people looted the Macy’s flagship store, as parts of the Bronx were again burning — de Blasio took a page out of Roosevelt’s book.
The decision to implement a curfew did not come easily.
As recently as May 31, di Blasio was telling reporters that a curfew was unlikely, even as they were being imposed in large cities around the country.
Sunday night changed his mind. Looters shattered plate-glass windows in the Flatiron district and SoHo, and stole what they found inside. They set scaffolding on fire.
The next morning, before his regularly scheduled press briefing, the mayor and his current police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, broached the idea of a curfew.
At the same time, the governor’s office was expressing alarm.
“On Monday morning, we reached out and said, we are very, very concerned that what you are doing is not working in the city to maintain order,” one state official said.
Later that afternoon, the mayor conferred with Shea and Cuomo. He decided that a curfew would begin at 11 p.m. The news was then divulged by the governor during a local radio interview in Albany.
That evening, de Blasio was on the ground as the protests kicked off and the looting began.
“He saw the situation had escalated earlier in the night than it had on Sunday and there was more looting overall,” said Freddi Goldstein, the mayor’s press secretary.
So de Blasio made what she said was an “immediate decision” to start the curfew at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. He and Shea later decided to extend the curfew though the end of the week, Goldstein said. Neither decision was discussed with the governor.
David Dinkins, the former New York City mayor who presided over the last major spate of civil unrest in the city — four days of interracial violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn — said he had no advice or counsel to offer the current mayor but he expressed apprehension about the unrest.
“The language I would use is ‘concerned,’” Dinkins said. “Rodney King comes to mind. Tough times.”
Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City, said the future of the city may well depend on the mayor getting this right.
“One very prominent business owner said to me this morning, ‘This is far worse than COVID,’” Wylde said. The business owner works in private equity. “This is the first time through this whole thing that he’s thought of closing shop and moving out of New York.”
“And if we can’t stop this, there will be a mass exodus,” she added.
De Blasio is in the toughest situation that any modern mayor of New York City has ever been through, Davidoff said.
And the situationis likely to last a good while longer.
Bratton predicted that the civil unrest precipitating the curfew was likely to last until the June 9 funeral of Floyd.
“This is clearly going to run for another week or 10 days,” Bratton said.

WASHINGTON — Retired senior military leaders condemned their successors in the Trump administration for ordering military units Monday to rout those peacefully protesting police violence near the White House.
As military helicopters flew low over the nation’s capital and National Guard units moved into many cities, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly aligned themselves behind a president who chose tear gas and rubber bullets to clear peaceful protesters from a park so that he could stage a photo op at a nearby church.
In so doing, Esper, who described the country as a “battlespace” to be cleared, and Milley, who wore combat fatigues on the streets of the capital, thrust the 2 million active-duty and reserve service members into the middle of a confrontation in which the “enemy” is not foreign, but domestic.
The reaction has been swift and furious.
Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote on Twitter that “America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy.”
Gen. Tony Thomas, the former head of the Special Operations Command, tweeted: “The ‘battle space’ of America??? Not what America needs to hear … ever, unless we are invaded by an adversary or experience a constitutional failure … ie a Civil War.”
Adm. Mike Mullen, another former chairman, wrote in the Atlantic: “Whatever Trump’s goal in conducting his visit, he laid bare his disdain for the rights of peaceful protest in this country, gave succor to the leaders of other countries who take comfort in our domestic strife, and risked further politicizing the men and women of our armed forces.”
Television networks broadcast images of Milley and Esper walking behind President Donald Trump as he crossed Lafayette Square Monday evening to pose for a photo holding a Bible in front of St. John’s church. Earlier in the day, Esper joined the president’s call with governors, saying, “We need to dominate the battlespace” — a comment that set off a torrent of criticism.
More than 40% of active-duty and reserve personnel are people of color, and orders to confront protesters demonstrating against a criminal justice system that targets black men troubled many.
The Air Force’s top enlisted airman took to Twitter to express his anger.
“Just like most of the Black Airmen and so many others in our ranks … I am outraged at watching another Black man die on television before our very eyes,” Kaleth O. Wright, the chief master sergeant of the Air Force, said in a Twitter thread, citing the names of black men who died in police custody or in police shootings. “I am George Floyd … I am Philando Castile, I am Michael Brown, I am Alton Sterling, I am Tamir Rice.”
Neither Esper nor Milley knew when they went to the Oval Office Monday that they would be taking part in the president’s photo op, Pentagon officials said. Nor did they know, officials said, that law enforcement personnel would be firing tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters in Lafayette Square before they crossed that park with Trump.
During the meeting in the Oval Office, which officials said became heated, Milley and Attorney General William Barr argued against invoking the Insurrection Act to override governors and send active-duty troops to states where there are protests. They were able to get Trump to hold off for now, but the president nonetheless ordered active-duty troops deployed to the one place where he did not have to go through governors: the District of Columbia.
After the Oval Office meeting, officials said, Trump said he wanted to review personnel who were deployed outside the White House. Along with a number of White House staff members, Esper and Milley joined the president — and prompted outrage.
“Ridiculous. General Milley, who I respect, is embarrassing himself,” Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama, said on Twitter. “I worked 3 years at the White House at the National Security Council. I never once saw Admiral Mullen come to the building ready for war.”
The Pentagon has yet to say how many soldiers it is deploying to Washington, per Trump’s order. Defense Department officials have given varying numbers, from 500 to “thousands.”
One Pentagon official said that the troops deploying to the capital might not be limited to the military police. The official, who said that decisions were still being made, added that the troops were coming from Ft. Bragg in North Carolina, Ft. Drum in New York and might also, surprisingly, include the so-called Old Guard ceremonial unit. The Old Guard provides security for Washington and escort to the president.
The order to deploy active-duty troops to confront protesters and looters prompted one military official to liken the order to Trump requesting his own “palace guard.”
This week, Trump said, without elaborating, that Milley was in charge of the effort to confront the protesters and looters.
At the Pentagon, officials expressed surprise at the president’s comments and referred questions to the White House. But officials noted that all National Guard members now deployed in the United States are under the authorities of the governors. Defense Department officials said that if those troops are federalized — that is, put under the power of the president rather than governors — that would normally be done under the auspices of U.S. Northern Command, which oversees military units on U.S. territory, and not the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called on Tuesday for Esper and Milley to testify before lawmakers about the potential deployments of U.S. military personnel to states.
As soldiers arrived Monday, clad in camouflage uniforms and clutching riot shields labeled “military police” to reinforce the line of crowd control officers guarding Lafayette Square yards from the White House, the crowd of about 400 protesters responded with verbal taunts. “Fascists!” some yelled. Others booed. A few shouted expletives.
Around 10 p.m., the military stepped up its attempts to suppress the protesters. A crowd making its way through the Chinatown area of Washington had gone relatively unbothered by law enforcement, having snaked across town, blocking roads and chanting “We can’t Breathe,” “George Floyd” and “Hands up, don’t shoot.” The group, for the most part, was peaceful.
A Black Hawk helicopter, followed by a smaller medical evacuation helicopter, dropped to rooftop level with its searchlights aimed at the crowd. Tree limbs snapped, nearly hitting several people. Signs were torn from the sides of buildings. Some protesters looked up, while others ran into doorways. The downward force of air from the rotors was deafening.
The helicopters were performing a “show of force” — a standard tactic used by military aircraft in combat zones to scatter insurgents. The maneuvers were personally directed by the highest echelons of the Washington National Guard, according to a military official with direct knowledge of the situation. The Guard did not respond to a request for comment.
The deployment is also challenging for National Guard units, which inherited a legacy from the Revolutionary War militia, the citizen-soldiers who were ready to put down their plows and pick up weapons to defend their country. Today, when the National Guard can be dispatched for an array of missions — like combat duty in Iraq or Afghanistan, helping with flood relief or providing assistance to coronavirus victims — that balance is more complicated.
Members of the Guard generally report to the governor of their state, but when units come under the command of the president, federal law prohibits them from being used domestically except under some very limited circumstances.
As of Tuesday morning, governors in 28 states and the District of Columbia had activated more than 20,400 National Guard troops to assist state and local law enforcement in support of civil unrest operations, the National Guard said.
In the current unrest, military personnel specialists say, the Guard is caught between expressing anguish over the killing of a black man, George Floyd in Minneapolis, and supporting civilian authorities in quelling the violent protests and looting that followed.
“Most of the soldiers will have sympathy for the peaceful protesters and be angry about Floyd’s death, but they’re probably angry at the violence as well,” said Peter D. Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University who has studied the military for decades. “It puts them in a fraught position.”

As Protests Engulf the United States, China Revels in the Unrest [With graphic(s)]

The cartoon shows the Statue of Liberty cracking into pieces, a police officer breaking through its copper robe. A man’s head lies on the ground in front of the White House, its facade splattered with blood.
“Beneath human rights,” says the title of the cartoon, which was published by People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, and circulated widely on social media sites this week.
As protests over police violence engulf hundreds of cities in the United States, China is reveling in the moment, seizing on the unrest to tout the strength of its authoritarian system and to portray the turmoil as yet another sign of American hypocrisy and decline. It is a narrative that conveniently ignores many of the country’s own problems, including its history of ethnic discrimination, its record on human rights and its efforts to suppress protests in Hong Kong.
Chinese officials are trolling their American counterparts with protest slogans like “Black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe.” The state-run media is featuring stories about the “double standards” of the United States for supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators. Prominent Chinese commentators are arguing that American-style democracy is a sham, pointing to the country’s bungled response to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing racial tensions.
“This situation in the U.S. will make more Chinese people support the Chinese government in its efforts to denounce and counter America,” Song Guoyou, a scholar at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in an interview. “The moral ground of the United States is indeed greatly weakened.”
The propaganda push is the latest skirmish in a long-standing power struggle between China and the United States, with relations between the two countries at their lowest point in decades.
President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of covering up the coronavirus outbreak that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, saying China should be held responsible for deaths in the United States and around the world. He has also threatened to punish China for moving to adopt a broad new security law in Hong Kong by curtailing the city’s special relationship with the United States.
Now, the protests in the United States are giving Xi and the Communist Party’s propagandists a natural line of counter attack.
Chinese social media sites are rife with video clips of tense standoffs between the police and protesters in the aftermath of the death last week of George Floyd, after he was pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer who has since been charged with murder. Television shows feature videos of National Guard troops patrolling city streets, as broadcasters describe the long history of discrimination against minorities in the United States. Social media sites are portraying America as unruly and chaotic: “This is not Syria, this is the U.S.!” read a caption on one popular site.
Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper controlled by the party, called on the U.S. government to “stand with the Minnesota people.” Its editor, in a tweet, pointedly called out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who had said “we stand by the people of Hong Kong” in his condemnation of Beijing’s move to impose national security rules.
“The violent protests in the streets of urban America are further discrediting the U.S. in the eyes of ordinary Chinese,” said Susan Shirk, chair of the U.C. San Diego 21st Century China Center. “The propaganda depicts American politicians as hypocrites living in glass houses while throwing stones at China.”
Shirk said that as the reputation of the United States suffers in China fewer people might be willing to voice support for American ideals, such as free markets and civil liberties.
“Even without the propaganda, Chinese people nowadays find little to admire in the U.S.,” she said. “As the U.S. model is tarnished, the voice of Chinese liberals is silenced.”
While Chinese officials have gleefully joined the global chorus of criticism aimed at the United States, the unrest has put them in an awkward position.
China’s government has long maintained strict limits on free speech and activism, and authorities often resort to aggressive tactics to quash unrest. The police in Hong Kong, where the government is backed by Beijing, have been accused of using excessive force as it has sought to rein in anti-government protests that have convulsed the semiautonomous territory over the past year.
With the comparisons to Hong Kong unmistakable, many mainland commentators have stopped short of endorsing the tactics used by American protesters, instead denouncing racism in the United States in general terms and rehashing protest slogans.
“The chronic racial wound in the United States is now smarting again,” said a recent report by Xinhua, the state-run news agency.
The Chinese government, in its first official statement on Trump’s move against Beijing’s national security rules, directly called out the United States for hypocrisy. A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, noted on Monday how American officials have portrayed protesters in their own country as “thugs” but glorified Hong Kong protesters as “heroes.”
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, echoed the party line on Tuesday, accusing the United States of having “double standards.”
“When it comes to their country’s security, they attach great importance,” she said at a regular news briefing. “When it comes to my country’s security, especially regarding Hong Kong’s current situation, they’ve put on tinted glasses.”
Chinese officials, wading into the complex racial politics of the United States, have sometimes struggled with striking the right note.
A spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, was widely praised in China recently when she wrote “I can’t breathe” in response to a critical Twitter post by an American official.
But she had less success with a post on Monday, when she wrote “All lives matter,” apparently unaware she was embracing a slogan that has been used in the United States to criticize the #BlackLivesMatter movement.
Chinese officials have used the protests to revive favorite propaganda themes, including the idea that the United States acts as a bully on the world stage, meddling in the affairs of other countries. Hong Kong has been a particular point of contention, with many news outlets in China pairing images of burning buildings and flags in American cities alongside comments last year by Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, praising a demonstration in Hong Kong as a “beautiful sight to behold.”
The editor-in-chief of Global Times, Hu Xijin, said that the attacks were to be expected given the intense criticism of China by American officials over the past year.
“It’s a kind of vengeful feeling, which I think is human nature,” he said in an interview. “Americans shouldn’t be unhappy about it.”
Hu said the unrest in the United States, as well as the failures in the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, had strengthened confidence among many Chinese in Beijing’s political system.
“It has made them believe that the government of this country really cares about people’s lives and well-being,” he said. “They see how the U.S. government and capital despise the lives and interests of vulnerable and marginalized groups.”
Nationalism has been in full force in recent days on the Chinese internet, with many people taking to Weibo, a popular microblogging platform, to denounce the “arrogance” of the United States and Trump. Hashtags about the American protests, including the decision to deploy the National Guard in some cities, are among the most popular topics on the site.
Some worry that the propaganda campaign may further inflame tensions between the two countries. He Weifang, an outspoken law professor in Beijing, said that even some critics of the government are becoming more sympathetic to the official line.
“Any Chinese with a brain,” he said, “would not simply look at it as China being so successful and the U.S. being a failure.”
But, he added, “with the terrible compression of space for free speech, many people’s heads are gradually broken.”

Joe Biden on Tuesday excoriated President Donald Trump’s stewardship of a nation convulsed in crisis over issues of race and police brutality, likening Trump’s language to that of Southern racists of the 1960s and accusing him of sullying the highest ideals of America.
“Donald Trump has turned this country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears,” Biden said, speaking against a backdrop of American flags at Philadelphia’s City Hall. “Is this who we want to be? Is this what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self-absorption, selfishness?”
The country, Biden said, is “crying out for leadership.”
Biden’s remarks, which were by turns optimistic about America’s potential and somber about the depth of the country’s challenges, come as his team moves urgently to draw sharper contrasts between the presumptive Democratic nominee and Trump on traits of character, empathy and steadiness.
In the past several days alone, Trump has lectured governors, called protesters “terrorists,” spent time in an underground bunker, sought to deploy the military and visited a church for photographs while protesters were dispersed with tear gas to clear his path.
In his remarks, which lasted around 20 minutes, Biden both rebuked his opponent and addressed the broader problems gripping the nation, saying directly — in a way that he did not always emphasize during the primary — that defeating Trump would not be enough to heal the nation’s centuries-old divisions and hatreds.
“We’re a nation in pain,” Biden said. “We must not let our pain destroy us. We’re a nation enraged, but we cannot let our rage consume us. We’re a nation that’s exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion defeat us. As president, it’s my commitment to all of you is to lead on these issues and to listen, because I truly believe in my heart of hearts, we can overcome.”
Traveling to Philadelphia from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to address the civil unrest consuming the nation, Biden called the presidency “a very big job” and said no one would get everything right, including him.
“But I promise you this,” he added. “I won’t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country — not use them for political gain.”
It was his first public trip out of state since the coronavirus shuttered the campaign trail in March, and his third public appearance in three days.
How Biden handles the coming weeks could define his candidacy for the final five months of the presidential contest — and there is an increasing sense of urgency among his allies to see him leading from the ground.
“This is a moment in our nation’s history that is as unique as if we had the 1918 pandemic and the 1929 stock market crash and the 1968 riots all happen at the same time,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “There’s a limit to how much leadership you can show without seeing people, hearing from people, connecting with people. Joe Biden has always been at his best when people can feel and see his empathy.”
The former vice president, 77, is cautiously re-emerging onto the public landscape at one of the most volatile, high-stakes moments in a generation.
The killing of George Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes, has sparked an outpouring of grief and anger across the country. Peaceful demonstrations during the day have turned chaotic at night as images of U.S. cities, under curfew and on fire, blanket the airwaves.
Meanwhile, the coronavirus rages on, with more than 100,000 Americans dead, and more than 40 million people who have filed for unemployment.
“We can be forgiven for believing the president is more interested in power than in principle,” Biden said. “More interested in serving the passions of his base than the needs of the people in his care. For that’s what the presidency is: the duty to care.”
Biden, who spent much of the spring campaigning virtually, made a public Memorial Day appearance last week to pay his respects to Delaware’s war dead. He emerged again for a Sunday walk around Wilmington, visiting the site of demonstrations and meeting with store owners, said Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., who accompanied him. That was followed Monday by an in-person meeting with faith and community leaders at a historic black church.
Such activity “shows you his heart and his understanding of the urgency of this moment,” Coons said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he went to Minneapolis.”
A leader, Coons added, “takes some risks to hear people and to respect them.”
Yet polling shows that Biden still has work to do in communicating that image to the nation.
A Washington Post-ABC poll over the weekend found Biden with a 10 percentage point lead over Trump — but Trump bested Biden on the question of who is a strong leader. Fifty percent of those surveyed said they held that view of Trump and 49% said they did not, while 43% said they saw Biden as a strong leader and 49% did not.
The activity that Biden has pursued so far, when many Americans are still under lockdown and health risks remain, stops well short of traditional rallies, live news conferences and other events that often drive television coverage, and his advisers have been openly frustrated about the lack of airtime he has received, although his Tuesday speech received widespread attention and coverage.
He is expected to intensify his public appearances over the next month — though the pace is not yet clear — with his early forays in Delaware offering a model. And during his meeting with community and faith leaders Monday, he promised that in coming weeks he would be making “very serious national speeches about where I think we have to go, what we have to do.”
Over the weekend and Monday, Biden’s campaign advisers engaged in fluid and evolving deliberations about how best to wade back into public activity as Delaware lifts its stay-at-home order. Internal discussions about how to handle Biden’s public appearances are affected by fast-changing news developments that can lead to haphazard planning scrambles, according to people close to the campaign.
Biden officials are also weighing the need for sensitivity to the fraught subject matter at hand, as well as ongoing health considerations for voters, staff and the candidate himself amid the pandemic.
“It’s a challenge to be in this kind of environment,” Blunt Rochester said Sunday. “We have to be careful for him and for others, and so he will continue to listen to the science. And if there are places where he can be, like today, to get out there, be social distant — he had his mask, we were all careful, but it does change the way you campaign.”
On Sunday Biden spent much of his time listening — to passersby, to business owners and to her own experience as the mother of a black man, Blunt Rochester said.
“The moment right now is pivotal,” Blunt Rochester said. “The question is, what are we going to do? What are we going to do as a result of it? And so as he continues to build his platform, part of it is listening to people.”
Biden also spent part of Sunday calling mayors on the front lines of the crisis to offer encouragement. He spoke with Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minnesota, his campaign confirmed. Biden asked after Carter’s family and offered his assistance, the mayor recalled in an interview.
“He asked me how I thought he could be supportive of the work we’re trying to lead nationally, and how he could be helpful in that space,” Carter said.
The mayor said that he had stopped using the term “recovery,” pressing the need for more transformational change on matters from health care to the economy.
“January and February were not a state of stability for too many Americans,” he said.

Autoridades y expertos en salud pública temen que las marchas que reúnen a miles de manifestantes incrementen las posibilidades de nuevos casos de la COVID-19.

Las protestas masivas contra la brutalidad policial que han sacado a miles de personas de sus hogares a las calles de las ciudades en todo Estados Unidos hacen surgir el espectro de nuevos brotes de coronavirus, lo que lleva a líderes políticos, médicos y expertos en salud pública a advertir que las multitudes podrían causar un aumento en los casos.
Si bien muchos líderes políticos resguardan el derecho de los manifestantes a expresarse, instaron a quienes salen a protestar a usar mascarillas y mantener el distanciamiento social, tanto para protegerse a sí mismos como para evitar una mayor propagación del virus en la comunidad.
Más de 100.000 estadounidenses han muerto por la COVID-19, la enfermedad causada por el nuevo coronavirus. La comunidad afroamericana ha sido particularmente afectada: se han registrado tasas de hospitalización y muertes que superan con creces las de los blancos.
Las protestas en decenas de ciudades estadounidenses han sido impulsadas por la muerte de George Floyd, la semana pasada, a manos de la policía de Minneapolis. Pero el descontento y la indignación que se esparcen por las calles de una ciudad a otra también reflejan las tensiones duales, acumulativas, que surgen de décadas de asesinatos policiales y de las súbitas pérdidas de familiares y amigos por el virus.
El flujo espontáneo de las protestas están ocurriendo cuando muchos estados han comenzado a reabrir con cautela, después de semanas de órdenes de quedarse en casa y con millones de estadounidenses desempleados. Los restaurantes, las escuelas, las playas y los parques están bajo escrutinio mientras el público práctica tentativamente las nuevas formas de distanciamiento social.
En Los Ángeles, donde las manifestaciones condujeron el sábado al cierre de sitios donde se hacen pruebas para el virus, el alcalde Eric Garcetti advirtió que las protestas podrían convertirse en “eventos súper propagadores”, refiriéndose a los tipos de reuniones, generalmente en lugares cerrados, que pueden llevar a una explosión de infecciones secundarias.
El gobernador de Maryland, el republicano Larry Hogan, expresó la preocupación de que su estado podría registrar un aumento en los casos en aproximadamente dos semanas, que es el tiempo que tardan en aparecer los síntomas después de que alguien ha sido infectado, mientras que la alcaldesa de Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, aconsejó a las personas que salieron a protestar “que se hicieran una prueba de la COVID esta semana”.
Algunos expertos en enfermedades infecciosas se tranquilizaron por el hecho de que las manifestaciones ocurrieron al aire libre, y dijeron que ese factor podría mitigar el riesgo de transmisión. Además, muchos de los manifestantes llevaban mascarillas y, en algunos lugares, parecían evitar agruparse demasiado.
“El aire exterior diluye el virus y reduce la dosis infecciosa que podría existir, y si sopla una brisa, eso diluye aún más el virus en el aire”, dijo William Schaffner, experto en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de Vanderbilt. “Literalmente corrían mucho, lo que significa que exhalan más profundamente, pero también que se cruzan entre todos muy rápido”.
Las multitudes tendían a ser más de jóvenes, señaló, y los adultos más jóvenes generalmente tienen mejores resultados si se enferman, aunque existe el riesgo de que puedan transmitir el virus a familiares y miembros del hogar que pueden ser mayores y más susceptibles. Pero otros estaban más preocupados por el riesgo que representaban las marchas. Howard Markel, historiador médico que estudia pandemias, comparó a las multitudes de manifestantes con los desfiles por la Primera Guerra Mundial celebrados en ciudades como Filadelfia y Detroit en medio de la pandemia de gripe de 1918, que a menudo fueron seguidos por picos en los casos de gripe.
“Sí, las protestas son al aire libre, pero todos están muy cerca los unos de los otros, y en esos casos, estar afuera no te protege tanto”, dijo Markel. “Las reuniones públicas son reuniones públicas, no importa que protestes o vitorees. Esa es una razón por la que no estamos teniendo juegos de béisbol masivos y es posible que no haya fútbol americano universitario este otoño”.
Aunque muchos manifestantes llevaban mascarillas, otros no. El SARS-CoV-2, el virus que causa la enfermedad de la COVID-19, se transmite principalmente a través de las gotículas que se propagan cuando las personas hablan, tosen o estornudan; gritar y corear consignas durante una protesta puede acelerar la propagación, dijo Markel.
El gas lacrimógeno y el espray de pimienta, que la policía ha utilizado para dispersar a las multitudes, hacen que las personas lloren y tosan, y aumentan las secreciones respiratorias de los ojos, nariz y boca, lo que aumenta más la posibilidad de transmisión. Los esfuerzos de la policía para mover multitudes a través de áreas urbanas estrechas pueden resultar en acorralar a las personas más cerca unas de las otras, o terminar encerrando a las personas en espacios reducidos.
Y las emociones están caldeadas, dijo Markel. “La gente se pierde en el momento y pierden la conciencia de quién está cerca de ellos, quién no, quién lleva una mascarilla, quién no”, dijo.
La mayor preocupación es la que ha afectado a los expertos en enfermedades infecciosas desde que comenzó la pandemia, y es el arma secreta del coronavirus: que puede ser transmitida por personas que no presentan síntomas y se sienten lo suficientemente sanas como participar en las protestas.
“Hay un gran número de portadores asintomáticos, y eso lo hace muy arriesgado”, dijo Markel.
Ashish Jha, profesor y director del Instituto de Salud Global, dijo que más de la mitad de las infecciones por coronavirus se transmiten por personas asintomáticas, incluidas algunas infectadas que nunca desarrollan síntomas y otras que aún no saben que están enfermas.
Arrestar, transportar o encarcelar a los manifestantes aumenta el potencial de propagación del virus. Jha pidió a los manifestantes que se abstengan de la violencia e instó a la policía a ejercer moderación.
Scott Gottlieb, excomisionado de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos, que apareció en el programa Face the Nation de CBS el domingo, también predijo que las protestas llevarían a nuevas “cadenas de transmisión”.
Él dijo que las desigualdades sociales y económicas, incluido el acceso deficiente a la atención médica, la discriminación en los entornos de salud, una mayor dependencia del transporte público y diferencias en el empleo fueron factores que llevaron a una mayor carga de enfermedad de la COVID-19 entre las personas no blancas.
“Detener la pandemia dependerá de nuestra capacidad para cuidar a aquellos de nosotros que son más vulnerables médica y socialmente”, dijo Gottlieb. “Necesitamos resolver estos problemas subyacentes para eliminar el riesgo de propagación pandémica de la epidemia”.
El Departamento de Salud de Nueva York ofreció estos consejos a los manifestantes: “Usar mascarilla, usar protección en los ojos para prevenir lesiones, mantenerse hidratado, usar desinfectante para manos, no gritar —y usar mejor carteles—, mantenerse en grupos pequeños y estar a una distancia de dos metros de otros grupos”.

Barbara Davidson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, was covering a protest near The Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles on Saturday when a police officer ordered her to move.
She showed him her press credentials, she said in an interview. The officer said he did not care and again told her to leave the area.
After saying, “Sir, I am a journalist covering this,” Davidson turned to walk away, and the officer shoved her in the back, causing her to trip and hit her head against a fire hydrant, she said. She was not hurt, she added, because she was wearing a helmet she had bought while getting skateboarding equipment for a nephew.
Davidson, who sells her work through Redux Pictures, an agency that supplies photographs to The New York Times, Newsweek and other news organizations, was among the many journalists who had tense encounters with police during the nationwide demonstrations against racism and police brutality that have taken place since George Floyd died in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Many reporters, photographers and press advocates said the treatment of journalists by police officers in recent days reflected an erosion of trust in the news media that has seeped into law enforcement under President Donald Trump, who has deemed critical coverage of his administration “fake news” and has frequently labeled some news organizations and journalists with variants of the phrase “enemies of the people.”
“This story, in particular, it seems journalists are really being targeted by the police,” Davidson said. “That’s not something I have experienced before to this degree.”
It is common in autocratic countries for journalists to be arrested during demonstrations and riots, but rare in the United States, where freedom of the press is guaranteed by the First Amendment. In a sign that police officers would not follow the customary hands-off approach, Minnesota State Patrol officers arrested a CNN reporting team live on the air Friday. That same day, a TV reporter in Louisville, Kentucky, was hit by a pepper ball by an officer who appeared to be aiming at her while she covered the protest on live television.
The arrest of the CNN team drew criticism from First Amendment advocates and an apology from Minnesota’s governor, but there have been dozens of other instances of journalists receiving rough treatment at the hands of police officers while covering the protests. In interviews, reporters said they had identified themselves as members of the press before police fired projectiles, drew their weapons or pepper-sprayed them.
“I’ve really never seen anything like this,” said Ellen Shearer, a professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and a co-director of its National Security Journalism Initiative. “The president has called the news media ‘the enemy of the people.’ I think all of that has taken a toll.”
On Sunday, Trump blamed the “Lamestream Media” for the protests in a tweet, calling journalists “truly bad people with a sick agenda.”
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker and a writer for the Bellingcat website have each tracked about 100 instances of reporters being harassed or injured at the protests. Many of the reporters were effectively embedded with protesters and were likely not targeted because they were journalists. But in some instances, journalists were attacked after telling officers that they were on the job.
Tyler Blint-Welsh, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, said he was hit multiple times by police officers while covering a protest in New York on Sunday. “I was backing away as request, with my hands up,” Blint-Welsh, who is black, wrote on Twitter. “My NYPD-issued press badge was clearly visible.” (He declined to comment for this article.)
Hyoung Chang, a staff photographer for the Denver Post for 23 years, spent a few hours near the Colorado Statehouse on Thursday, taking photos of demonstrators while wearing his press badge around his neck. In the evening, police officers tried to break up the crowd, and Chang heard what sounded like pepper balls being fired.
“Then one police officer started pointing at me and started to shoot,” he said.
Chang was hit with something in his chest, and then in his elbow. Part of his press card was blown off.
“I was staying in the same spot,” Chang said, emphasizing that he had been standing near the police for some time while holding cameras and equipment. “I think they know I’m a photographer.”
Carolyn Cole, a Los Angeles Times photographer, was covering a protest in Minneapolis on Saturday when police moved to disperse a crowd, she said in a text message. A group of roughly 20 journalists standing apart from the protesters moved aside, but the police attacked them directly with pepper spray and rubber bullets, she said. A colleague, reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske, shouted, “We’re reporters!”
Cole was wearing a press pass around her neck and a flak jacket with “TV” on it, she said. She was pepper-sprayed in her left ear and eye, and her cornea was damaged, she said.
“I’ve been covering conflict both nationally and internationally for many years, so I know the dangers involved in these situations, especially when you get between riot police and protesters,” Cole said, “but I wasn’t expecting them to attack us directly.”
Ed Ou, a video and photojournalist for NBC News who was next to Cole, was pepper-sprayed and hit with what he believes was a baton and a projectile fired by the police, he said in an interview.
Ali Velshi, an MSNBC reporter, said that he was on his way back from a rally in Minneapolis that had become violent — during which he was hit in the left leg by a rubber bullet — when the police stopped him and his camera crew at an intersection. With hands raised, the reporter and his colleagues identified themselves as members of the news media, Velshi said. One police officer responded, “We don’t care,” Velshi said. A projectile was fired at them, he said, but they were not injured.
Maggie Koerth, a senior science reporter for the website FiveThirtyEight, said she was covering a protest from a Minneapolis sidewalk Saturday when a police officer drew a weapon on her and another working journalist.
“We said, ‘Press, press — we are press,’ and we held up our badges and put our hands up in the air,” she said in an interview. “They kept pointing the weapon at us while we were doing that and one of them said, ‘Shut up.’”
Michael Anthony Adams, a correspondent at Vice News, said he identified himself as a member of the press when police arrived Saturday night at the Minneapolis gas station where he was conducting interviews. In a video that Adams recorded of the incident, he can be heard repeatedly identifying himself as a reporter.
“I don’t care. Get down,” an officer responds.
Adams continued to take video as he lay on the ground, holding up his press badge with one hand. Then he was sprayed with what he believes was pepper spray.
The incident reminded Adams of being tackled by police officers while on assignment in Turkey this year. “That’s something that I would expect in Turkey,” he said of the country, where journalists have been jailed under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “But in America, I wouldn’t have expected this.”
Journalists have also been on the receiving end of harsh treatment from protesters. Near the White House on Saturday, demonstrators chased and threw objects at the Fox News reporter Leland Vittert and members of his crew. On Friday, protesters vandalized CNN headquarters in Atlanta.
Then there were the arrests. Andrea May Sahouri, a reporter at The Des Moines Register, was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed in zip-ties after identifying herself as a journalist while covering a protest at a Des Moines mall Sunday evening. She took livestream video from the back of a police vehicle Sunday evening. She was later released.
Christopher Mathias, a HuffPost reporter, was covering a protest Saturday night in Brooklyn when an officer ran into him, saying, “Get out of my way!” Mathias said in an interview that he then verbally insulted the officer, who turned around and hit Mathias in the abdomen with his baton.
Mathias was restrained and handcuffed. He said he was wearing a press pass issued by HuffPost and had repeatedly told the police he was a journalist. His case was processed at a precinct at around 1 a.m. Sunday and he was issued a summons.
Mathias said he does not believe journalists deserve special treatment. But he added that it was unusual in his experience — he has covered protests in Baltimore, New York and Charlottesville, Virginia — for the police to tangle with reporters and arrest them.
“I don’t think I was initially targeted,” he said. But, he added, “They definitely knew I was a journalist.”
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker counted five reporters arrested at protests Sunday. Police departments in New York, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Denver did not reply to requests for comment.
“There is now a culture of impunity for attacks on the press,” said Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, an organization based at the Columbia University School of Journalism. “It’s essentially the abandonment of press freedom as an American value.”
Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney for The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that while the First Amendment does not exempt journalists from crowd-control orders, its emphasis on freedom of the press should offer some protection to those covering demonstrations.
“Journalists are there as representatives of the public, and if law enforcement is attacking them, they can’t do their job, and that hurts everybody,” she said.

Full text: "I've really never seen anything like this": Reporters and news photographers describe being roughed up, arrested and shot with projectiles while covering demonstrations across the country.
Barbara Davidson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, was covering a protest near the Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles on Saturday when a police officer ordered her to move.
She showed him her press credentials, she said in an interview. The officer said he did not care and again told her to leave the area.
After saying, "Sir, I am a journalist covering this," Ms. Davidson turned to walk away, and the officer shoved her in the back, causing her to trip and hit her head against a fire hydrant, she said. She was not hurt, she added, because she was wearing a helmet she had bought while getting skateboarding equipment for a nephew.
Ms. Davidson, who sells her work through Redux Pictures, an agency that supplies photographs to The New York Times, Newsweek and other news organizations, was among the many journalists who had tense encounters with the police during the nationwide demonstrations against racism and police brutality that have taken place since George Floyd died in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Many reporters, photographers and press advocates said the treatment of journalists by police officers in recent days reflected an erosion of trust in the news media that has seeped into law enforcement under President Trump, who has deemed critical coverage of his administration "fake news" and has frequently labeled some news organizations and journalists with variants of the phrase "enemies of the people."
"This story, in particular, it seems journalists are really being targeted by the police," Ms. Davidson said. "That's not something I have experienced before to this degree."
It is common in autocratic countries for journalists to be arrested during demonstrations and riots, but rare in the United States, where freedom of the press is guaranteed by the First Amendment. In a sign that police officers would not follow the customary hands-off approach, Minnesota State Patrol officers arrested a CNN reporting team live on the air on Friday. That same day, a TV reporter in Louisville, Ky., was hit by a pepper ball by an officer who appeared to be aiming at her while she covered the protest on live television.
The arrest of the CNN team drew criticism from First Amendment advocates and an apology from Minnesota's governor, but there have been dozens of other instances of journalists receiving rough treatment at the hands of police officers while covering the protests. In interviews, reporters said they had identified themselves as members of the press before police fired projectiles, drew their weapons or pepper-sprayed them.
"I've really never seen anything like this," said Ellen Shearer, a professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and a co-director of its National Security Journalism Initiative. "The president has called the news media 'the enemy of the people.' I think all of that has taken a toll."
On Sunday, Mr. Trump blamed the "Lamestream Media" for the protests in a tweet, calling journalists "truly bad people with a sick agenda."
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker and a writer for the Bellingcat website have each tracked about 100 instances of reporters being harassed or injured at the protests. Many of the reporters were effectively embedded with protesters and were likely not targeted because they were journalists. But in some instances, journalists were attacked after telling officers that they were on the job.
Tyler Blint-Welsh, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, said he was hit multiple times by police officers while covering a protest in New York on Sunday. "I was backing away as request, with my hands up," Mr. Blint-Welsh, who is black, wrote on Twitter. "My NYPD-issued press badge was clearly visible." (He declined to comment for this article.)
Hyoung Chang, a staff photographer for The Denver Post for 23 years, spent a few hours near the Colorado statehouse on Thursday, taking photos of demonstrators while wearing his press badge around his neck. In the evening, police officers tried to break up the crowd, and Mr. Chang heard what sounded like pepper balls being fired.
"Then one police officer started pointing at me and started to shoot," he said.
Mr. Chang was hit with something in his chest, and then in his elbow. Part of his press card was blown off.
"I was staying in the same spot," Mr. Chang said, emphasizing that he had been standing near the police for some time while holding cameras and equipment. "I think they know I'm a photographer."
Carolyn Cole, a Los Angeles Times photographer, was covering a protest in Minneapolis on Saturday when the police moved to disperse a crowd, she said in a text message. A group of roughly 20 journalists standing apart from the protesters moved aside, but the police attacked them directly with pepper spray and rubber bullets, she said. A colleague, the reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske, shouted, "We're reporters!"
Ms. Cole was wearing a press pass around her neck and a flak jacket with "TV" on it, she said. She was pepper-sprayed in her left ear and eye, and her cornea was damaged, she said.
"I've been covering conflict both nationally and internationally for many years, so I know the dangers involved in these situations, especially when you get between riot police and protesters," Ms. Cole said, "but I wasn't expecting them to attack us directly."
Ed Ou, a video and photojournalist for NBC News who was next to Ms. Cole, was pepper-sprayed and hit with what he believes was a baton and a projectile fired by the police, he said in an interview.
Ali Velshi, an MSNBC reporter, said he was on his way back from a rally in Minneapolis that had become violent -- during which he was hit in the left leg by a rubber bullet -- when the police stopped him and his camera crew at an intersection. With hands raised, the reporter and his colleagues identified themselves as members of the news media, Mr. Velshi said. One police officer responded, "We don't care," Mr. Velshi said. A police officer fired a projectile at them, he said, but they were not injured.
Maggie Koerth, a senior science reporter for the website FiveThirtyEight, said she was covering a protest from a Minneapolis sidewalk on Saturday when a police officer drew a weapon on her and another working journalist.
"We said, 'Press, press -- we are press,' and we held up our badges and put our hands up in the air," she said in an interview. "They kept pointing the weapon at us while we were doing that, and one of them said, 'Shut up."'
Michael Anthony Adams, a correspondent at Vice News, said he identified himself as a member of the press when police arrived on Saturday night at the Minneapolis gas station where he was conducting interviews. In a video that Mr. Adams recorded of the incident, he can be heard repeatedly identifying himself as a reporter.
"I don't care. Get down," an officer responds.
Mr. Adams continued to take video as he lay on the ground, holding up his press badge with one hand. Then he was sprayed with what he believes was pepper spray.
The incident reminded Mr. Adams of being tackled by police officers while on assignment in Turkey this year. "That's something that I would expect in Turkey," he said of the country, where journalists have been jailed under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. "But in America, I wouldn't have expected this."
Journalists have also been on the receiving end of harsh treatment from protesters. Near the White House on Saturday, demonstrators chased and threw objects at the Fox News reporter Leland Vittert and members of his crew. On Friday, protesters vandalized CNN headquarters in Atlanta.
Then there were the arrests. Andrea May Sahouri, a reporter at The Des Moines Register, was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed in zip ties after identifying herself as a journalist while covering a protest at a Des Moines mall on Sunday evening. She took livestream video from the back of a police vehicle Sunday evening. She was later released.
Christopher Mathias, a HuffPost reporter, was covering a protest on Saturday night in Brooklyn when an officer ran into him, saying, "Get out of my way!" Mr. Mathias said in an interview that he then insulted the officer, who turned around and hit Mr. Mathias in the abdomen with his baton.
Mr. Mathias was restrained and handcuffed. He said he was wearing a press pass issued by HuffPost and had repeatedly told the police he was a journalist. His case was processed at a precinct at around 1 a.m. Sunday, and he was issued a summons.
Mr. Mathias said he does not believe journalists deserve special treatment. But he added that it was unusual in his experience -- he has covered protests in Baltimore, New York and Charlottesville, Va. -- for the police to tangle with reporters and arrest them.
"I don't think I was initially targeted," he said. But, he added, "they definitely knew I was a journalist."
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker counted five reporters arrested at protests on Sunday. Police departments in New York, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Denver did not reply to requests for comment.
"There is now a culture of impunity for attacks on the press," said Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, an organization at the Columbia University School of Journalism. "It's essentially the abandonment of press freedom as an American value."
Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that while the First Amendment does not exempt journalists from crowd-control orders, its emphasis on freedom of the press should offer some protection to those covering demonstrations.
"Journalists are there as representatives of the public, and if law enforcement is attacking them, they can't do their job, and that hurts everybody," she said.

Pandemia y protestas por la violencia policiaca: dos crisis convulsionan a Estados Unidos [With graphic(s)]

Son plagas paralelas que azotan a Estados Unidos: el coronavirus y las muertes de hombres y mujeres de raza negra a manos de la policía.
Ambas cambiaron drásticamente la vida de Jimmy Mills. Su peluquería en el centro de Mineápolis era uno de los pequeños negocios de propietarios negros que han batallado para sobrevivir la pandemia. De cualquier forma, Mills se sentía esperanzado porque, después de dos meses de tener cerrado el negocio, planeaba abrir de nuevo la próxima semana.
Por desgracia, el viernes 29 de mayo, temprano, el barrio de clase trabajadora en el que Mills ha cortado el cabello de muchos desde hace 12 años estaba en llamas debido a las caóticas manifestaciones en protesta por la muerte de George Floyd y los asesinatos de afroestadounidenses cometidos por la policía que inundaron Mineápolis y otras ciudades por todo Estados Unidos.
“Primero lo del coronavirus y ahora esto, es como un tiro a las tripas”, dijo Mills, de 56 años.
La agitación estalló con un video que captura los agonizantes últimos minutos de Floyd, con un policía blanco arrodillado haciendo presión sobre su cuello, y se ha extendido por toda la nación, ya de por sí consumida por el enojo y la ansiedad. Las emociones están a flor de piel debido a las más de 100.000 víctimas mortales que ha cobrado la pandemia en todo el país y los millones de trabajos que se han perdido por su causa. El domingo se informó que al menos otros seiscientos estadounidenses murieron de COVID-19.
Los residentes de Mineápolis afirmaron que la indignación y las protestas tras el asesinato de Floyd eran consecuencia de las constantes pruebas a las que se ha visto sometida la comunidad en las últimas semanas, tanto por el virus como por la violencia policiaca, y en formas que ponen de relieve las profundas desigualdades raciales que existen en Estados Unidos.
El brote epidémico ha impuesto presiones económicas y sanitarias desproporcionadas sobre las minorías raciales y los inmigrantes, tanto en Mineápolis como en los alrededores. Una mayor proporción de trabajadores negros y de origen latino han perdido su empleo. Muchos otros se encuentran entre los trabajadores por hora que reciben ingresos bajos y arriesgan su salud al ir a trabajar a tiendas de abarrotes, asilos, fábricas, mataderos y otros empleos que no pueden realizarse a distancia.
La comunidad negra de Minnesota también ha sufrido un duro golpe debido al virus; afroestadounidenses por todo el país se infectan y mueren a tasas más altas.
Según un cálculo, la población negra ha sufrido por lo menos el 29 por ciento de los casos conocidos de COVID-19 en Minnesota, a pesar de constituir alrededor del seis por ciento de la población del estado. El 35 por ciento de los casos de coronavirus en Mineápolis han sido afroestadounidenses, con todo y que constituyen menos del 20 por ciento de la población de la ciudad.
“No hay palabras para describir lo que está viviendo la gente”, dijo Mohamud Noor, quien representa en la Cámara Baja del estado a un distrito en el que viven muchos somalíes y otros inmigrantes. Su tío abuelo murió a causa del coronavirus hace unos días, y Noor declaró que ya le cuesta trabajo mantenerse al tanto de cuántos familiares y constituyentes más mueren.
Noor señaló que el cierre de escuelas había afectado a los estudiantes más pobres que no tienen computadora portátil o acceso confiable a internet para tomar clases en línea, y que las oleadas de despidos habían disparado las tasas locales de desempleo. Ahora que más de 200 negocios han sido dañados o destruidos debido a la agitación, Noor dijo que le preocupa que surjan nuevas oleadas de ejecuciones hipotecarias, negocios en quiebra y pérdida de trabajos.
“Para muchas personas pobres que no tenían mucho, esta devastación las afectará en gran medida”, dijo Noor.
Incluso antes de la pandemia, el barrio del centro donde se incendiaron varios edificios y otros resultaron dañados o fueron presa de saqueos había intentado levantarse después de años de dificultades económicas. El área se encuentra en una zona de la ciudad que siempre ha sufrido marginación y en la que algunos residentes se habían sentido abandonados. Una vía de tren se acondicionó para operar como ruta ciclista y peatonal a través del barrio. Se creó el mercado Midtown Global Market, que atrajo a comensales y clientes a sus puestos de artesanías y cocina internacional del pueblo hmong, de India y de Marruecos.
Pero ahora, al lado del peluquero Mills, una tienda de todo por un dólar y otra de productos de belleza están hechas cenizas. Los escaparates de la peluquería de Mills están rotos, y algunos saqueadores se llevaron sus televisores, equipo de video y máquinas rasuradoras.
Ahora que no hay electricidad, el agua escurre por todo el piso y se han colocado barreras de oficiales de policía y efectivos de la Guardia Nacional que bloquean su barrio, no sabe cuándo podrá reabrir su negocio, J-Klips.
“La mitad de los locales se han declarado en ruinas”, aseveró. “¿Y ahora qué hacemos?”.
Phillipe Cunningham, miembro del concejo de la ciudad, representa a un barrio pobre en el norte de Mineápolis con una gran población negra, hmong y de nativos americanos. Dijo que había pasado los últimos dos meses luchando para que se abriera un sitio de pruebas de coronavirus y respondiendo llamadas de trabajadores despedidos que se atrasaban en el pago del alquiler y de empresarios afroamericanos que no lograban navegar por el laberinto de los programas federales de ayuda.
El viernes 29 de mayo, Cunningham condujo por el barrio e inspeccionó edificios dañados, ayudó a algunos de los dueños de negocios a cerrar sus escaparates e intentó prevenir que los saqueadores ingresen a las tiendas.
“Ya estábamos en apuros”, dijo Cunningham.
En muchas zonas de la ciudad donde el virus pareció haberse concentrado, los residentes no han tenido acceso a mascarillas ni a desinfectantes para manos, aunque el alcalde ordenó que dentro de los negocios se utilicen mascarillas desde la semana pasada, dijo Jia Starr Brown, pastora de la iglesia First Covenant en el centro de Mineápolis.
Incluso quienes seguían sanos en Mineápolis se sentían ansiosos con la llegada de la primavera después de tanto tiempo de estar confinados en su casa; no se había programado la reapertura de algunos negocios hasta el lunes. La flexibilización de las restricciones incluía una larga lista de reglas sanitarias y de distanciamiento social.
Brown habló después de separarse de una manifestación frente a un edificio del condado el 29 de mayo por la tarde, y dijo que se sentía bien ver a tanta gente reunida para exigir justicia para Floyd, aunque hacerlo representara un riesgo para su salud.
“Se trata de una pena colectiva generalizada, y la pena debe ser enorme para que la gente arriesgue sus medios de subsistencia”, dijo. “Es más importante demostrar qué tipo de personas somos que cualquier riesgo por estar afuera. Es urgente hacer algo. No solo se trata de nuestra propia vida como gente de raza negra, sino de nuestro futuro y de nuestros hijos”.
Muchos jóvenes, especialmente de minorías, tenían dos o tres trabajos a medio tiempo que se evaporaron cuando llegó el brote, dijo Tyler Sit, pastor de la iglesia New City, que está a unas cuadras de donde murió Floyd y de la comisaría de policía que fue quemada en las protestas. Se quedaron sin trabajo y preocupados por no contar con prestaciones laborales en caso de enfermarse.
Sentados en casa durante el encierro, sin ocupación y sin perspectivas de encontrar trabajo en el futuro inmediato, estaban más conscientes de lo habitual de los informes de noticias y luego tuvieron tiempo de reaccionar tomándose las calles.
“Escucho mensajes de miembros de la comunidad que intentan deliberar si van a ir o no. No quieren enfermarse de COVID y propagar COVID si resultan ser portadores asintomáticos”, dijo. “Pero hay un sentimiento profundo de que tenemos que hacer algo porque nuestra ciudad está ardiendo”.
En Atlanta, Denver, Nueva York y otros lugares también ha habido manifestaciones a pesar de la pandemia. Los manifestantes llevan puestos cubrebocas y pañuelos para protegerse del coronavirus, además del gas lacrimógeno.
Anais Nunez, organizadora comunitaria de 31 años de edad, residente del barrio Allerton en el Bronx, dijo que se atrevió a asistir a una manifestación con muchas otras personas para demostrar solidaridad con quienes protestan en contra de la violencia policiaca.
“Soy del Bronx, el epicentro del epicentro”, dijo sobre el vecindario que registra la mayor proporción de casos, hospitalizaciones y muertes a causa del coronavirus en toda la ciudad. “Ya debemos soportar un gran sufrimiento. Tener que hacer esto agrava todavía más una situación terrible”.
Rashawn Ray, sociólogo e investigador del Instituto Brookings, enfatizó que una diferencia crucial entre las dos plagas es que el coronavirus —al igual que otras enfermedades del pasado— quizá desaparezca gracias a una vacuna o un descubrimiento médico. “Nunca hemos llegado a un punto en que el racismo no sea una parte significativa de la vida de todos los habitantes de Estados Unidos”, señaló.

‘All of It Is Toxic’: Misinformation About Protests Surges Online [With graphic(s)]

On Twitter and Facebook, hundreds of posts are circulating saying that George Floyd is not actually dead.
Conspiracy theorists are baselessly arguing that George Soros, the billionaire investor and Democratic donor, is funding the spreading protests against police brutality.
And conservative commentators are asserting with little evidence that antifa, the far-left antifascism activist movement, coordinated the riots and looting that sprang from the protests.
Untruths, conspiracy theories and other false information are running rampant online as the furor over Floyd, an African American man who was killed last week in police custody in Minneapolis, has built. The misinformation has surged as the protests have dominated conversation, far outpacing the volume of online posts and media mentions about last year’s protests in Hong Kong and Yellow Vest movement in France, according to the media insights company Zignal Labs.
At its peak Friday, Floyd and the protests around his death were mentioned 8.8 million times, said Zignal Labs, which analyzed global television broadcasts and social media. In contrast, news of the Hong Kong protests reached 1.5 million mentions a day and the Yellow Vest movement 941,000.
“The combination of evolving events, sustained attention and, most of all, deep existing divisions make this moment a perfect storm for disinformation,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “All of it is toxic, and make our very real challenges and divisions harder to address.”
The collision of racial tensions and political polarization during the coronavirus pandemic has supersized the misinformation, researchers said. Much of it is being shared by the conspiracy group QAnon and far-right commentators as well as by those on the left, Brookie said.
President Donald Trump himself has stoked the divisive information. Over the last few days, he posted on Twitter that antifa was a “Terrorist Organization” and urged the public to show up for a “MAGA Night” counterprotest at the White House.
Along with that, people are experiencing high levels of fear, uncertainty and anger, said Claire Wardle, executive director of First Draft, an organization that fights online disinformation. That creates “the worst possible context for a healthy information environment,” she said.
Twitter and Facebook did not immediately have a comment.
Here are three significant categories of falsehoods that have surfaced on social media platforms about Floyd’s death and the protests.
George Floyd’s ‘Fake’ Death
The unfounded rumor that Floyd is alive is emblematic of the misinformation narrative that a newsworthy event was staged. This has become an increasingly common refrain over the years, with conspiracy theorists saying, among other examples, that the 1969 moon landing and the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School were hoaxes.
On Friday, the YouTube conspiracy channel JonXArmy shared a 22-minute video that falsely asserted Floyd’s death had been faked. The video was shared nearly 100 times on Facebook, mostly in groups run by QAnon, reaching 1.3 million people, according to data from CrowdTangle, a tool that analyzes interactions across social media.
Jon Miller, who runs the JonXArmy channel, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. YouTube said on its site that it had removed the video, citing its policy on hate speech.
On Twitter, posts stating that “George Floyd is not dead” were also tweeted hundreds of times over the last week, with the phrase peaking at 15 mentions in a 10-minute span Monday morning, according to Dataminr, a social media monitoring service.
In thousands of other posts on Facebook and Twitter, people falsely stated that Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota police officer who was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death, was an actor and that the entire incident had been faked by the deep state.
The George Soros Conspiracy
The false idea that Soros funded the protests spiked on social media over the last week, showing how new events can resurrect old conspiracy theories. Soros has for years been cast as an anti-conservative villain by a loose network of activists and political figures on the right and has become a convenient boogeyman for all manner of ills.
On Twitter, Soros was mentioned in 34,000 tweets in connection with Floyd’s death over the last week, according to Dataminr. Over 90 videos in five languages mentioning Soros conspiracies were also posted to YouTube over the last seven days, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
On Facebook, 72,000 posts mentioned Soros in the last week, up from 12,600 the week before, according to The Times’ analysis. Of the 10 most engaged posts about Soros on the social network, nine featured false conspiracies linking him to the unrest. They were collectively shared over 110,000 times.
Two of the top Facebook posts sharing Soros conspiracies were from Texas’ agriculture commissioner, Sid Miller, an outspoken supporter of Trump.
“I have no doubt in my mind that George Soros is funding these so-called ‘spontaneous’ protests,” Miller wrote in one of the posts. “Soros is pure evil and is hell-bent on destroying our country!”
Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Farshad Shadloo, a YouTube spokesman, said that the Soros conspiracy videos did not violate the company’s guidelines but that the site was not recommending them.
A spokeswoman for Soros said, “We deplore the false notion that the people taking to the streets to express their anguish are paid, by George Soros or anyone else.”
Antifa Misinformation
The unsubstantiated theory that antifa activists are responsible for the riots and looting was the biggest piece of protest misinformation tracked by Zignal Labs, which looked at certain categories of falsehoods. Of 873,000 pieces of misinformation linked to the protests, 575,800 were mentions of antifa, Zignal Labs said.
The antifa narrative gained traction because “long-established networks of hyperpartisan social media influencers now work together like a well-oiled machine,” said Erin Gallagher, a social media researcher.
That began when Trump tweeted Sunday that “ANTIFA led anarchists” and “Radical Left Anarchists” were to blame for the unrest, without providing specifics. Then he called antifa “a Terrorist Organization.”
Dan Bongino, a conservative political commentator who has unsuccessfully run for a House seat several times, then took up the call. On the “Fox and Friends” television show Monday, Bongino said antifa activists were responsible for a “sophisticated” attack on the White House and called it an “insurrection.”
He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Those assertions soon spread around social media. More than 6,000 Facebook posts linking the antifa movement to the protests appeared in the last seven days, collecting more than 1.3 million likes and shares, according to The Times’ analysis.
And on Twitter, a fake “manual” specifying “riot orders” that was supposedly issued by Democrats directing antifa activists to stir up trouble circulated prominently. But the so-called manual was a resurrection of an old hoax linked to the April 2015 riots in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, the fact-checking website Snopes reported.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday lashed out at governors for their response to the violence roiling the country, calling protesters “terrorists,” calling for “retribution” and warning the governors they would look like “jerks” if they did not send them to “jail for long periods of time.” Trump told the governors “you have to dominate” and said if they failed to take a strong hand, the protesters were “going to run over you; you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.” In blunt remarks rarely heard from an American president, he prodded the chief executives not to be “too careful.”
“Someone throwing a rock is like shooting a gun,” Trump told them. “You have to do retribution.”
The tirade, delivered on a private conference call and captured on audio obtained by The New York Times, showed the depth of Trump’s anger over protests and riots that have bubbled up in more than 100 U.S. cities after the death of a black man under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis. For days, Trump has hunkered in the White House, expressing himself largely on Twitter.
But his call with the governors showed how Trump is not taking a moment of deep national crisis to appeal for reconciliation but is instead solely pressing the governors to use force. He struck that tone even though aides spent the better part of the weekend trying to convince him that the unrest was about a deeper issue.
“You’re making yourself look like fools,” he told the governors, chiding them for not all calling out the National Guard.
Taking over a call that was supposed to feature Vice President Mike Pence, who has been praised in his efforts to forge relationships with governors during the coronavirus pandemic, Trump said that Minnesota had become “a laughingstock all over the world.” The president had just spoken with President Vladimir Putin of Russia before addressing the governors.
Alluding to television footage of violence and looting, Trump called the people committing those acts “scum” and demanded of the governors: “Why aren’t you prosecuting them?”Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois used the call to confront the president, stating that Trump had used “inflammatory” language.“We have to call for calm,” said Pritzker, whose state was hit with a wave of looting over the weekend, adding that “the rhetoric that’s coming out of the White House is making it worse.” Trump, who has rarely been so directly criticized during his coronavirus-related conference calls with the governors, swiped back. “I don’t like your rhetoric much either,” he said. He told Pritzker he could do “a much better job.”
Pritzker was not the only governor to express unease. In an illustration of this precarious moment, Gov. Janet Mills of Maine, a Democrat, told the president that his planned trip to Maine this week may provoke more unrest. “I’m very concerned your presence may cause security problems for our state,” Mills said.
The president said, “we’ll look into that,” before firing back that he expected “a tremendous crowd of people showing up,” predicting that “most of them are very favorable.”
“They like their president,” Trump said. Trump, who has not formally addressed the nation since the unrest began, said he was putting Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “in charge” but did not immediately specify what that meant or if he would deploy the military to quell the violence in the nation’s cities.
The president also zeroed in on unrest in New York City, reminding the governors that he maintained a residence there and suggesting that police should be able to do their jobs.
“I don’t know what’s happening in Manhattan, but it’s terrible,” Trump said. “New York is going to have to toughen up. We’ll send you National Guard if you want.” Again stoking conflict, he said New York police officers had “to be allowed maybe to do their jobs.”
Trump often sounded as much like an angry bystander as the nation’s president, repeatedly recalling his reaction to televised footage of the unrest.
“They just walked right down the street, knocking them out with tear gas, tear gas,” he said of the National Guard’s handling of the riots in Minneapolis. “These guys, they were running.”And without evidence, Trump asserted that after the crackdown in the Twin Cities the protesters had left to create mayhem in other localities.”They’re all looking for weak spots,” he said of the protesters. “Now what they’re going to do is search out perhaps smaller cities.”The governors, the president said, must apprehend them.”And you can’t do the deal where they get one week in jail,” he said. “These are terrorists. These are terrorists. And they’re looking to do bad things to our country.”Perhaps recognizing the risks he was taking with his language, Trump acknowledged the presence of his attorney general, William Barr.“I’m not asking my attorney general, and perhaps you’ll stop me from saying that, but you’re allowed to fight back,” he said.
Trump has long used language common to authoritarians than to democratically elected leaders to speak about protesters. In 1990, Trump told Playboy magazine that Beijing showed “the power of strength” when it used deadly military force to quell the student-led demonstrations at Tiananmen Square the year before.
“When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it,” Trump said. “Then they were vicious; they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.”
In 2016, Trump said the comments were not an endorsement before calling the students “rioters” and reiterating that a “strong, powerful government” stopped the protests.And even as president, he has openly nudged law enforcement officers to treat those apprehended with harsh tactics.
“When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough — I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice,’ ” Trump said to applause from Long Island, New York, police officers in a 2017 speech.

Barbara Davidson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, was covering a protest near The Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles on Saturday when a police officer ordered her to move.
She showed him her press credentials, she said in an interview. The officer said he did not care and again told her to leave the area.
After saying, “Sir, I am a journalist covering this,” Davidson turned to walk away, and the officer shoved her in the back, causing her to trip and hit her head against a fire hydrant, she said. She was not hurt, she added, because she was wearing a helmet she had bought while getting skateboarding equipment for a nephew.
Davidson, who sells her work through Redux Pictures, an agency that supplies photographs to The New York Times, Newsweek and other news organizations, was among the many journalists who had tense encounters with police during the nationwide demonstrations against racism and police brutality that have taken place since George Floyd died in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis.
Many reporters, photographers and press advocates said the treatment of journalists by police officers in recent days reflected an erosion of trust in the news media that has seeped into law enforcement under President Donald Trump, who has deemed critical coverage of his administration “fake news” and has frequently labeled some news organizations and journalists with variants of the phrase “enemies of the people.”
“This story, in particular, it seems journalists are really being targeted by the police,” Davidson said. “That’s not something I have experienced before to this degree.”
It is common in autocratic countries for journalists to be arrested during demonstrations and riots, but rare in the United States, where freedom of the press is guaranteed by the First Amendment. In a sign that police officers would not follow the customary hands-off approach, Minnesota State Patrol officers arrested a CNN reporting team live on the air Friday. That same day, a TV reporter in Louisville, Kentucky, was hit by a pepper ball by an officer who appeared to be aiming at her while she covered the protest on live television.
The arrest of the CNN team drew criticism from First Amendment advocates and an apology from Minnesota’s governor, but there have been dozens of other instances of journalists receiving rough treatment at the hands of police officers while covering the protests. In interviews, reporters said they had identified themselves as members of the press before police fired projectiles, drew their weapons or pepper-sprayed them.
“I’ve really never seen anything like this,” said Ellen Shearer, a professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and a co-director of its National Security Journalism Initiative. “The president has called the news media ‘the enemy of the people.’ I think all of that has taken a toll.”
On Sunday, Trump blamed the “Lamestream Media” for the protests in a tweet, calling journalists “truly bad people with a sick agenda.”
Tyler Blint-Welsh, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, said he was hit multiple times by police officers while covering a protest in New York on Sunday. “I was backing away as request, with my hands up,” Blint-Welsh, who is black, wrote on Twitter. “My NYPD-issued press badge was clearly visible.” (He declined to comment for this article.)
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker and a writer for the Bellingcat website have each tracked about 100 instances of reporters being harassed or injured at the protests. Many of the reporters were effectively embedded with protesters and were likely not targeted because they were journalists. But in some instances, journalists were attacked after telling officers that they were on the job.
Hyoung Chang, a staff photographer for the Denver Post for 23 years, spent a few hours near the Colorado Statehouse on Thursday, taking photos of demonstrators while wearing his press badge around his neck. In the evening, police officers tried to break up the crowd, and Chang heard what sounded like pepper balls being fired.
“Then one police officer started pointing at me and started to shoot,” he said.
Chang was hit with something in his chest, and then in his elbow. Part of his press card was blown off.
“I was staying in the same spot,” Chang said, emphasizing that he had been standing near the police for some time while holding cameras and equipment. “I think they know I’m a photographer.”
Ali Velshi, an MSNBC reporter, said that he was on his way back from a rally in Minneapolis that had become violent — during which he was hit in the left leg by a rubber bullet — when the police stopped him and his camera crew at an intersection. With hands raised, the reporter and his colleagues identified themselves as members of the news media, Velshi said. One police officer responded, “We don’t care,” Velshi said. A projectile was fired at them, he said, but they were not injured.
Maggie Koerth, a senior science reporter for the website FiveThirtyEight, said she was covering a protest from a Minneapolis sidewalk Saturday when a police officer drew a weapon on her and another working journalist.
“We said ‘Press, press — we are press,’ and we held up our badges and put our hands up in the air,” she said in an interview. “They kept pointing the weapon at us while we were doing that and one of them said, ‘Shut up.’”
Michael Anthony Adams, a correspondent at Vice News, said he identified himself as a member of the press when police arrived Saturday night at the Minneapolis gas station where he was conducting interviews. In a video that Adams recorded of the incident, he can be heard repeatedly identifying himself as a reporter.
“I don’t care, get down,” an officer responds.
Adams continued to take video of what was happening as he lay on the ground, holding up his press badge with one hand. Then he was sprayed with what he believes was pepper spray.
The incident reminded Adams of being tackled by police officers while on assignment in Turkey this year. “That’s something that I would expect in Turkey,” he said of the country, where journalists have been jailed under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “But in America, I wouldn’t have expected this.”
Then there were the arrests. Andrea May Sahouri, a reporter at The Des Moines Register, was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed in zip-ties after identifying herself as a journalist while covering a protest at a Des Moines mall Sunday evening. She took livestream video from the back of a police vehicle Sunday evening. She was later released.
Christopher Mathias, a HuffPost reporter, was covering a protest Saturday night in Brooklyn when an officer ran into him, saying, “Get out of my way!” Mathias said in an interview that he then verbally insulted the officer, who turned around and hit Mathias in the abdomen with his baton.
Mathias was restrained and handcuffed. He said he was wearing a press pass issued by HuffPost and had repeatedly told the police he was a journalist. His case was processed at a precinct at around 1 a.m. Sunday and he was issued a summons.
Mathias said he does not believe journalists deserve special treatment. But he added that it was unusual in his experience — he has covered protests in Baltimore, New York and Charlottesville, Virginia — for the police to tangle with reporters and arrest them.
“I don’t think I was initially targeted,” he said. But, he added, “They definitely knew I was a journalist.”
The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker counted five reporters arrested at protests Sunday. Police departments in New York, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Denver did not reply to requests for comment.
“There is now a culture of impunity for attacks on the press,” said Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, an organization based at the Columbia University School of Journalism. “It’s essentially the abandonment of press freedom as an American value.”
Sarah Matthews, a staff attorney for The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that while the First Amendment does not exempt journalists from crowd-control orders, its emphasis on freedom of the press should offer some protection to those covering demonstrations.
“Journalists are there as representatives of the public, and if law enforcement is attacking them, they can’t do their job, and that hurts everybody,” she said.

From Sacramento to San Diego, Californians Join Protests [With graphic(s)]

Over the weekend, in at least 140 cities across the country, demonstrators took to the streets in outpourings of grief and rage over the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who, before he died, pleaded with the white police officer who had pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck.
“I can’t breathe,” he can be heard saying in a graphic video.
In California — despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s support of the demonstrations and assurances about the will to better address systemic racism — widespread protests sparked by Floyd’s death were yet another reminder that the state’s progressive politics have not healed deep wounds in black and Latino communities, which continue to be the targets of disproportionate policing here, just as they are in other parts of the country.
And so, Californians in cities large and small joined the protests. Many of the demonstrations started peacefully and became violent, with widespread looting. Hundreds have been arrested.
Protests in Los Angeles
In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti at first reassured Angelenos that he would not call in the National Guard, although demonstrations downtown had taken a destructive turn.
“This is not 1992,” he said, referencing the riots that year spurred by Los Angeles police officers’ beating of Rodney King.
But by Saturday afternoon, after police officers and demonstrators clashed in the city’s upscale Fairfax district, Garcetti reversed course. He announced an overnight curfew.
Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles County.
And as the sun rose Sunday, for the first time since 1992, National Guard troops patrolled Los Angeles’ streets.
The Los Angeles Times reported that for many black Angelenos, the current moment bears similarities to that era. But as one resident told the paper, “It’s worse today than it was back then.”
Later Sunday, while many peacefully marched in Santa Monica and Long Beach, looters ransacked department stores and smashed windows.
Officials announced another Los Angeles countywide curfew Sunday night roughly an hour before it was set to go into effect.
Protests in the Bay Area
In Oakland, the legacy of Oscar Grant III loomed large over the weekend’s unrest.
When Grant was killed by a transit officer at the Fruitvale Bay Area Rapid Transit station on New Year’s Day in 2009, the outrage that followed has been widely cited as a kind of antecedent to the Black Lives Matter movement.
NBC Bay Area reported that Grant’s mother, Wanda Johnson, spoke about the compounding trauma for black Americans.
“We’re fighting the pandemic and we’re fighting this issue of hate,” she said.
As The San Francisco Chronicle reported, the pain inflicted by the pandemic was just one of several reasons this past week’s protests have been more “explosive” in the Bay Area.
On Friday, during protests, two officers were shot while protecting Oakland’s federal courthouse — one fatally. Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called the shooting an act of domestic terrorism.
Violence and looting — the latter rising especially Sunday — erupted in other Bay Area cities, like San Jose, Walnut Creek and Danville, which The Mercury News reported implemented curfews.
Protests in the Central Valley and the Inland Empire
While demonstrations had some tense moments, protests in the Central Valley and Inland Empire largely remained calm, according to The Fresno Bee and The Press-Enterprise.
There were exceptions, however. In at least two instances, passing drivers appeared to target protesters.
In Bakersfield — the seat of Kern County, where The Guardian once reported that police killed more people per capita than anywhere else in the country — a 31-year-old man was arrested after authorities say he drove through a crowd of protesters and struck a 15-year-old girl, according to KGET.
In Visalia, officials were investigating an incident Saturday in which a person driving a blue Jeep flying flags supportive of President Donald Trump struck two Black Lives Matter protesters, according to The Visalia Times Delta.
Protests around San Diego
In La Mesa, a small city in San Diego County, a crowd that had gathered in what started out as a peaceful protest Saturday eventually blocked Interstate 8, set two banks ablaze and damaged City Hall, according to The San Diego Union-Tribune.
Protesters said they were gathering in solidarity with those in Minneapolis, but they also aimed to draw attention to what they said was the unfair detention last week of a black man by a white officer at a transit station in an encounter that was captured on video.
Protests in Sacramento
And in the state’s capital, what started as peaceful demonstrations Friday, Saturday and Sunday deteriorated into chaos, according to The Sacramento Bee. Police officers shot rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters. Looters left behind a trail of destruction in the heart of the city.
Floyd’s death touched a particular nerve there, according to CapRadio, following the death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed young black man who was gunned down in his grandmother’s backyard in 2018 when the police mistook a cellphone he was holding for a gun.
The fury over his death was a driving force behind the state’s passage last year of landmark legislation that makes it easier to prosecute police officers who kill people on the job by raising the standard for the use of deadly force.
Supporters of the measure have said it makes California’s police use-of-force laws some of the strictest in the nation.
Still, the officers who shot Clark were never charged in his death.

George Floyd, 46, died handcuffed on the street in the custody of police in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. An officer responding to a report that Floyd had tried to pass a fake $20 bill held him down by lodging a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
He died shortly after lapsing into unconsciousness.
A 10-minute cellphone video of the encounter ignited protests across the country, not only over Floyd’s death, but over the bigger question of police brutality and entrenched racial injustice. Floyd’s was the third highly publicized, violent death of an African-American to cause widespread public outrage in just over three months.
All four officers involved in the arrest have been fired, and the officer who was recorded kneeling on Floyd’s neck, Derek M. Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Still unanswered is the question of precisely what caused Floyd’s death. A private autopsy commissioned by his family is scheduled for release on Monday afternoon.
What do we know about how Floyd died?
The video showed Chavin with his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd was unresponsive for nearly three minutes of that. He repeatedly gasped, “I can’t breathe,” but a criminal complaint in the case said that he had started to say he couldn’t breathe while he was still standing.
The full report of the Hennepin County medical examiner is pending, but the criminal complaint said that the autopsy “revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Floyd, the complaint said, had underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease.
“The combined effects of Mr. Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death,” the complaint said.
How can there have been no asphyxia?
Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensics expert at John Jay College, said that such a finding means there was no apparent damage to the internal structures of Floyd’s neck, such as damage to delicate bones and cartilage. But that does not mean the police officer’s actions did not lead to his death, he said.
“They have to come up with another explanation,” he said. “It does seem to me though, if the officer didn’t have his knee on his neck and being in prone position and with other officers holding him down, restraining him the way he was, had they not done that, he would be well and alive. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
When is the official autopsy report being released?
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office is waiting final results from laboratory studies “to provide the most medically accurate cause of death determination possible,” the office said in a statement.
“The autopsy alone cannot answer all questions germane to the cause and manner of death,” the statement said, noting that the findings “must be interpreted in the context of the pertinent investigative information and informed by the results of laboratory studies.”
What other medical issues are under review?
The autopsy results should show whether Floyd was under the influence of alcohol or any other drug.
Toxicology results usually take weeks, but presumably the testing will be expedited in this high-profile case.
Another thing that could come up: According to the complaint, one of the police officers at the scene said he was worried that Floyd might have been suffering from “excited delirium,” a condition characterized by agitation, aggression, acute distress and sudden death.
It is usually associated with drug users who suddenly die in law enforcement custody, though not all experts accept it as a real cause of death.
What about the autopsy commissioned by the family?
Michael M. Baden, who was the chief medical examiner for the City of New York in the late 1970s, conducted the examination. He is best known as host of the HBO television show, “Autopsy.” He also did the private autopsy in the case of Michael Brown, who was killed by a police officer in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri.
Baden was the first to reveal that the unarmed black teenager was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. His exam showed that one of the bullets entered the top of Brown’s skull, suggesting his head had been bent forward when it struck him and caused a fatal injury.
Glenn A. Zeitz, a Philadelphia trial lawyer specializing in civil rights who has worked on several cases that hinged on autopsy results, said the key question will be whether the examiners find that the cause of death was the combined effect of any preexisting heart condition and coronary artery disease coupled with the restraint by the police and any potential intoxicants in his system — or whether Baden will find something else.
“He is going to be looking for the things that are consistent with compression to the neck, which causes traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation,” he said. “This is about how this man died, who is responsible and whether the charges are the right charges.”
It remains to be seen whether the private autopsy results will differ substantially from those in the official report.
“You can have two people looking at the same thing coming up with different explanations,” Kobilinsky said. “This is not necessarily science, it’s medicine. Medicine is an art and a science.”

A small Minneapolis bail fund has received millions of dollars in funding from people after the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day after a white police officer pinned him to the ground with his knee.
Since Wednesday, the Minnesota Freedom Fund, founded in 2016, has received tens of thousands of donations from around the world, said Octavia Smith, the fund’s emeritus board president, many of them stemming from social media. Users posted screen shots of their donations after making them and implored their followers to match their contributions.
Within four days, the fund had raised about $20 million, Smith said.
“Everyone around the world is ready for justice,” Tonja Honsey, executive director of the fund, said on Friday. “They’re ready for real change, and they’re supporting that.”
Bail funds are independent charitable organizations that collect money to release those who have been jailed before trials. People who are arrested and charged are often assessed a fee that they have to pay in order to await trial freely.
Bail can cost thousands — even millions — of dollars, and disproportionately affects poor people, who are effectively jailed because they do not have enough money to pay for their freedom. Having those fees paid allows people to resume their lives until their cases’ outcomes are determined.
Such funds have existed in some form for hundreds of years, said Pilar Weiss, director of the Community Justice Exchange, which runs a directory of bail funds around the country called the National Bail Fund Network.
After years of Black Lives Matter protests, many people have become more accustomed to seeking them out when looking to support protesters. Over the weekend, as protests took place in at least 140 cities across the United States, calls promoting local bail funds spread on social media.
Sophia Lesperance, a 24-year-old administrative worker in Boston, tweeted Wednesday that she was looking to send money to pay bail for people protesting in Minneapolis. Her friend Huey Hewitt, a student who lives in Western Massachusetts, did some research and quickly found the Minnesota Freedom Fund.
“I know I can’t go out there,” Lesperance said. “I can’t fly out to Minnesota. I’m going to have to find a way to help out.”
Hewitt, 23, who will be pursuing a doctorate in African American studies at Harvard University starting this fall, said that the importance of bail funds had become clear to Black Lives Matter activists, reaching back to the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.
“I think this is a lesson that a lot of organizers learned from Ferguson,” he said. “As someone who has been involved in movement work for some time now, I just intuitively know there are going to be some political arrests in the wake of this.”
In Minnesota alone, more than 360 people were arrested over the weekend. Smith said Monday that once courts began to open and bail was posted, the fund would begin to pay for the protesters’ release.
Honsey said on Friday that she expected charges to come on a continual basis, for the next six months to a year.
Last week, some donors provided small incentives to encourage their followers to do the same. Marea Stamper, 42, a DJ known as the Black Madonna, said on Wednesday that if her followers sent her donation receipts, she would add them to the guest lists for her shows when touring resumes. (She set up a recurring donation, noting that bail organizations need funding “between major news events,” not just in their wake.)
She said that dozens of people had responded to her message and that “the amounts were pretty decent considering everyone’s pretty broke right now. I was like, ‘Who has $50?’” For the Minnesota Freedom Fund, people creatively incentivized donations, promising customized patches and partly nude pictures.
On Thursday, Chicago rapper Noname said that she had given the fund $1,000 and asked celebrities that followed her to match that amount. Janelle Monáe, Kehlani, Yara Shahidi and others quickly responded saying they had done so.
Other celebrities, including Seth Rogen and the Safdie brothers (the directors of “Uncut Gems”), formed chains, retweeting posts about matching with their own matching donations.
Atlanta rapper J.I.D. tweeted that he had donated $1,000 in response to Noname’s call. “That’s one of the people that I respect and can just trust her opinion,” he said of Noname in an interview. “That was cool that she helped me find it. I was already trying to find something, just anything. So that was just perfect timing.”
Weiss said that while there is a long tradition of communities pooling money to pay to free family members or friends — one that dates back to slavery — in the last five years there has been a growth of funds for people who can’t afford bail, spurred largely by the movement to end mass incarceration.
“I think that it’s become language that people know,” she said. “On Twitter, I’ll see that somebody will say, ‘This thing happened, I’ll get arrested. People might need to start a bail fund for me.’ It’s entered the lexicon.”
Weiss said that bail funds around the country had seen a surge of donations over the weekend, which she attributed in part to the Minnesota Freedom Fund’s visibility on social media. “That a very large audience of people started talking about bail funds definitely helped catalyze it,” she said.
Over the course of the last decade, it has become common for those looking to support a cause to send money to a single destination, often a GoFundMe campaign. Charitable causes of the moment often go viral, flooding the recipient with funds. But the organizers of campaigns intended to benefit large groups of people may not know how to distribute the money when the time comes.
“We’ve been set up doing this consistently,” said Honsey, of the Minnesota Freedom Fund. “We have all the pieces in place. It doesn’t take time to set up. We know exactly how the process goes.”
The organization has received so much support that it is trying to help others in the area, including the black-led organizations Reclaim the Block and Black Visions. By law, Honsey said, the fund is not able to regrant its funds to other organizations but is consulting with lawyers to see if there is some way to allocate the funds more broadly.
“This is what we were built for, to be sure that we’re supporting and freeing our people,” she said. “Whether it’s this or it’s COVID or it’s just a regular day, so many of our families are being locked up or being separated. It’s easy to get lost in the moment, but this is what we’ve been prepared for.”

As Protesters Flood Streets, Money Flows to Democrats, Bail Funds and Charities [With graphic(s)]

The mass protests that have swept the nation in recent days to express outrage at the death of George Floyd have been paired with a flood of financial donations, as hundreds of thousands of Americans have opened their wallets to give to charitable groups, community bail funds and Democratic candidates.
The Minnesota Freedom Fund, which pays bail for those who cannot afford it and received online support from some celebrities, took in a remarkable $20 million in a matter of days — so much that its website was now encouraging donors to give elsewhere.
A GoFundMe memorial fund established by Floyd’s brother had raised more than $7 million from more than a quarter-million contributors.
And on ActBlue, the central online hub that processes money for Democratic candidates and causes, Sunday was the single largest day of giving in all of 2020, with donations of $19 million, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation tracker.
The sum given on ActBlue on Sunday topped all the presidential primary debate nights and election nights in 2020, and was more than double the amount given on the final day of April (monthly deadlines tend to drive online political giving). The previous high for the year was the day in late February when former Vice President Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary and revived his campaign for president; donors contributed $18.3 million that day.
The giving timed to the protests was not just a one-day phenomenon: ActBlue processed more than $40 million between Friday and Sunday, a sign that the energy spilling into the streets nationwide might also be matched by a wave of money for Democratic causes. (The closest Republican equivalent of ActBlue, called WinRed, does not have a public donation ticker.)
ActBlue does not disclose in real time how donations to the platform are divided between candidates and causes, but a spokesperson for the site said half of the donations Sunday went to charitable causes.
One ActBlue page where supporters could split a donation across 37 different bail funds reported more than 20,000 donations worth about $1.5 million as of late Monday morning. Such funds help cover the costs of posting cash bail for those jailed before trials and are seen as a way to support protesters who have been arrested.
So much money is flowing so fast it is hard to keep track.
On Sunday evening, Sen. Bernie Sanders emailed his enormous list of supporters asking them to donate to a different group of charities. The email alone raised $400,000 in its first 12 hours, according to Mike Casca, a spokesman for Sanders.
One nonprofit in Minneapolis, the Lake Street Council, reported raising $2.25 million as of Monday morning from 27,000 donors. It said it would use the money to help rebuild businesses, “many of which are black- or minority-owned.”
In Illinois, the Chicago Community Bail Fund reported receiving more than $1.6 million from 30,000 people. An effort in Los Angeles, the People’s City Council Freedom Fund, went viral and jumped from $1,500 raised as of early Saturday to more than $860,000 on Monday from more than 21,000 contributors.
“Watching the numbers climb was surreal,” said Sabrina Johnson, an organizer with the Los Angeles group, which was initially raising funds to pay for tickets people received in April protesting the mayor’s response to the coronavirus. Johnson said the fund was now partnering with a local chapter of Black Lives Matter and the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive group, to distribute the windfall.
The group posted a cautionary note on Twitter after donating went viral. “If you share it,” it wrote of its GoFundMe page, “please let your followers know it’s not just a bail fund!”
For the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which posted a note directing people to other organizations Saturday, the volume of money was staggering. In the group’s most recent tax form available online, from 2018, it reported receiving $110,000 in donations.
“We have been flooded with tens of thousands donations large and small, totaling around $20 million dollars,” the group said in a note. “We did not ask for or anticipate this massive outpouring of support.”

Many Claim Extremists Are Sparking Protest Violence. But Which Extremists? [With graphic(s)]

Amid the rush to assign blame for the widespread violence and vandalism breaking out in American cities, accusations that extremists or other outside agitators were behind the destruction continued to ricochet online and on the airwaves Sunday.
Numerous political leaders, starting with President Donald Trump, have leveled accusations at various groups, asserting that some radical agenda is at play in transforming once peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
“We have reason to believe that bad actors continue to infiltrate the rightful protests of George Floyd’s murder, which is why we are extending the curfew by one day,” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota tweeted Sunday, after previously suggesting that white supremacists or people from outside the state fomented the unrest.
In New York City, a senior police official said anarchists had planned to start mayhem in the city even before the protests started, using encrypted communication to raise bail money and to recruit medics. During the demonstrations, they maintained supply routes to distribute gasoline, rocks and bottles, and also dispatched scouts to find areas devoid of police officers, said John Miller, deputy commissioner in charge of the Police Department’s counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts.
“They prepared to commit property damage and directed people who were following them that this should be done selectively and only in wealthier areas or at high-end stores run by corporate entities,” he said in a telephone briefing with reporters. Such activity was still under investigation, Miller said, but many participants, he said, were from outside New York. “They instructed group leaders to tell the people following them that this was not meant to be orderly activity,” he said.
Still, few of those pointing the finger at extremists presented much detailed evidence to support the accusations, and some officials conceded the lack of solid information.
“The truth is, nobody really knows,” Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general and a former Democratic congressman from Minneapolis, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“There’s been a lot of videotape taken by demonstrators of people who are very suspicious, who really did start breaking windows,” Ellison said. “There have been other photographs of cars with no license plates. Very suspicious behavior.”
It would all have to be investigated, he said.
People associated with both the extreme right and left are being accused of igniting the conflagration. The Trump administration blamed what it called the radical left, naming antifa, a contraction of the word “anti-fascist” that has come to be associated with a diffuse movement of left-wing protesters who engage in more aggressive techniques like vandalism.
Others said white supremacists and far-right groups were responsible, pointing to online statements by adherents that the upheaval would hasten the collapse of a multiethnic, multicultural United States.
“The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday, although it was unclear on what legal authority he could make that call.
The president has periodically criticized antifa, but it was not clear that Trump’s declaration would have any real meaning beyond his characteristic attempts to stir up culture war controversy, attract attention and please his base.
Antifa is not an organization, and it does not have a leader, membership roles or any defined, centralized structure. It is a vaguely defined movement of people who share common protest tactics and targets.
More important, even if antifa were a real organization, the laws that permit the federal government to deem entities terrorists and impose sanctions on them are limited to foreign groups. There is no domestic terrorism law despite periodic proposals to create one.
“There is no authority under law to do that — and if such a statute were passed, it would face serious First Amendment challenges,” said Mary B. McCord, a former head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.
When the FBI has investigated neo-Nazi organizations like the Base and Atomwaffen Division, it has treated them as criminal enterprises.
Nevertheless, in a statement after Trump’s tweet, Attorney General William Barr said the FBI would ally with state and local police to identify violent protesters, whom he also called domestic terrorists.
“Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate, violent and extremist agenda,” Barr said. “The violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.”
Antifa-style protesters are hostile to law enforcement and are oriented toward street action, said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, so these demonstrations provide an opportunity even if their goals are not the same as those of the original protesters. Still, he cautioned that in such a complex stew, not all the vandalism can be attributed to any one faction.
“While we have seen tactics they embrace at times during these protests, it is also unclear how many of the individuals committing violence or destroying property are antifa or just upset with the ongoing issue of police brutality,” he said.
Analysts noted a range of participants.
“We’re going to see a diversity of fringe malefactors,” said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. “We know for a fact there have been far-right agitators both online and at these rallies, as well as far-left.”
Far-right adherents generated an avalanche of posts on social media in recent days suggesting the unrest was a sign that the collapse of the American system they have long awaited was at hand. These groups, known as “accelerationists,” attempt to promote any circumstances that might speed that goal.
Last month they were pushing the idea that the coronavirus pandemic and the demonstrations against shutting down public life might be their moment to incite discord.
The groups are not monolithic. There are factions that express solidarity with some in the African American community in their animosity toward the police, a position dating to violent showdowns in the 1990s between white supremacists and law enforcement in places like Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
Others, however, believe that sparking a race war would ultimately bring about the establishment of a pure white ethnic state in at least part of the current United States.
Signs of any organized effort or even participation in the violence were relatively rare. “I have not seen any clear evidence that white supremacists or militiamen are masking up and going out to burn and loot,” said Howard Graves, a research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center who tracks white supremacist and other anti-government extremist groups.
Some participants included heavily armed members of the militia movement, ardent supporters of the Second Amendment right to bear arms who believe it is their constitutional duty to protect citizens and businesses.
Members of hate groups or far-right organizations filmed themselves, sometimes heavily armed or waving extremist symbols, at demonstrations in at least 20 cities in recent days, from Boston to Buffalo to Richmond, Virginia, to Dallas to Salem, Oregon.
A common nickname for their anticipated second Civil War is the “boogaloo,” which sometimes gets mutated into the “Big Igloo” or the “Big Luau,” prompting its adherents to wear Hawaiian shirts. Many of them use Facebook to organize despite the company’s May 1 announcement that it would remove such content.
Their flag is often a variation of the American flag, with an igloo instead of stars, one stripe replaced by a Hawaiian print and the rest showing the names of both African Americans and white people killed in confrontations with the police.
In a Facebook post from Richmond, two young white men are shown holding that flag up behind an African American woman with a hand-lettered sign reading “A knee is the new noose!!” That referred to the police action used in the death of Floyd.
Mike Griffin, a longtime activist in Minneapolis, said the demonstrations in his city attracted people he had never seen before. They included well-dressed young white men in expensive boots carrying hammers and talking about torching buildings. “I know protests, I’ve been doing it for 20 years,” he said. “People not affiliated with the protests are creating havoc on the streets.”
If it is happening, analysts said, it is probably arbitrary acts by individuals rather than an organized effort. Federal agents this year dismantled the Base and Atomwaffen, two of the most violent far-right groups.
It is one thing to share racist jokes and memes online and something else to organize an armed group to travel across state lines, said Megan Squire, a professor at Elon University in North Carolina who tracks extremists online. “They do not have strong real-world networks where they really trust each other,” she said.

Full text: A Princeton graduate and a human rights lawyer were both charged in an attack that left a police car dashboard charred. No one was injured.
Two lawyers were charged with taking part in a Molotov cocktail attack on a police patrol car over the weekend -- a human rights lawyer and a Princeton-educated associate at a Manhattan law firm.
The attack during the Brooklyn protests left the dashboard of a blue-and-white police car charred after a night of violent clashes between protesters and police, a symbol of the chaos wrought over a weekend of sometimes peaceful and sometimes violent demonstrations.
The car was unoccupied when the Molotov cocktail ignited, and no one was injured, the authorities said.
The two lawyers involved in the attack were identified by federal authorities as Urooj Rahman, 31, the human rights lawyer, and Colinford King Mattis, 32, an associate at the midsize law firm of Pryor Cashman LLP, who graduated from Princeton.
Both were arrested shortly after the incident early Saturday during protests against the killing of George Floyd, federal authorities said.
Mr. Mattis and Ms. Rahman were charged with causing damage to a police vehicle by fire and explosives, according to a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.
The Brooklyn prosecutors on Saturday also charged a 27-year-old woman from Catskill, N.Y., in a separate Molotov cocktail attack against another police vehicle, about 10 minutes later and a mile and a half away.
Mr. Mattis and Ms. Rahman were expected to appear on Monday before a federal magistrate in United States District Court in Brooklyn, and it could not be determined if they have lawyers representing them yet. A relative of Mr. Mattis who declined to be identified said, "He's not a bad person and his family supports him."
Police video surveillance near the 88th Precinct station house in the Fort Greene neighborhood captured the attack in which they are charged, according to the criminal complaint filed in their case.
The video showed Ms. Rahman climbing out of a tan 2015 Chrysler Town and Country minivan driven by Mr. Mattis and moving toward the patrol car, the complaint said.
As she neared, she lit a fuse hanging out of a Bud Light beer bottle and threw it through an already broken window of the police vehicle, igniting its console. The complaint said she returned to the minivan and the pair fled.
The police saw Ms. Rahman throw the Molotov cocktail and followed the two lawyers as they tried to get away, officials said. A patrol car stopped them several blocks away and they were arrested.
Inside the car, officers said they saw in plain view materials for making more Molotov cocktails -- a bottle filled with toilet paper and what was believed to be gasoline inside and a lighter, the complaint said.
Mr. Mattis began working in July 2018 as an associate in the corporate group at Pryor Cashman, where, according to his profile on the firm's website, he advises public and private companies, their executives and boards on mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, financing and corporate governance, among other matters.
He also served on the community board in East New York, the Brooklyn neighborhood where he lives.
Pryor Cashman, in a statement from Managing Partner Ronald H. Shechtman, said Mr. Mattis had been furloughed from the firm in April and that his status would be reviewed by the firm this week.
"As we confront critical issues around historic and ongoing racism and inequity in our society, I am saddened to see this young man allegedly involved in the worst kind of reaction to our shared outrage over what had occurred," the statement said.
The picture on his LinkedIn profile shows a smiling young man in a business suit, white shirt and striped red tie, and the profile says he graduated from Princeton University in 2010 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and earned a law degree from New York University Law School in 2016.
Ms. Rahman, a graduate of Fordham Law School, was identified as a human rights lawyer in a Facebook post about an April 30 talk she was scheduled to give to a Muslim group, where she was to discuss "Love of the Earth."
The criminal complaint charging the lawyers, filed late Saturday in United States District Court in Brooklyn, was sworn out by an F.B.I. agent assigned to the Joint Terrorist Task Force.
In the second attack, in Crown Heights, Samantha Shader threw a Molotov cocktail at a marked police van near Eastern Parkway and Washington Avenue, federal authorities charged.
Four officers were sitting inside but managed to scramble out, according to the criminal complaint in that case, and were not injured. The fuse had been lit, but the gasoline did not ignite.
Ms. Shader, like the two lawyers, was charged with causing damage to a police vehicle by fire and explosives, according to the criminal complaint in her case. She was arrested shortly after the attack, the complaint said. Her sister, Darian Shader, 21, was also taken into custody after attempting to interfere with her arrest, the police said.
Relatives and friends of the Shader sisters could not be reached for comment.
In 2017, a local newspaper based in Kingston, N.Y., reported Samantha Shader, then 24, and an unidentified 18-year-old woman, both of Catskill, were arrested by state police in Ulster County. Ms. Shader was charged with assault and menacing with a weapon, the local paper reported. She was released with a desk appearance ticket.

Walking a Fine Line on the Police, de Blasio Leaves Many Unsatisfied: [National Desk]

Full text: The mayor has cultivated an image of fighting against inequality and police abuses, yet this crisis has challenged him more than ever.
The brief video clip, widely circulated on social media and on the national news, seemed to capture a wanton act of police brutality: One police cruiser, and then a second, jolting into a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn, sending people sprawling across the street.
But Mayor Bill de Blasio's conflicted response to the incident highlighted the challenges he has faced in managing a crisis rooted in issues he has long pledged to tackle in New York City: racial discrimination, police abuses and inequality.
At a news conference on Sunday, the mayor called for an investigation, but also took pains to try to explain the officers' actions, saying that the situation "was created by a group of protesters blocking and surrounding a police vehicle, a tactic that we had seen before in the last few days, a tactic that can be very, very dangerous to everyone involved."
He added: "And we've seen direct attacks on police officers, including in their vehicles."
At different points in his tenure, Mr. de Blasio's efforts to turn his campaign pledges into policy and practice have been stymied, often frustrating many in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, whose dissatisfaction with the mayor has mounted.
Several of his former aides took the remarkable step of voicing their displeasure publicly on Twitter, in addition to privately discussing the mayor's actions in a separate thread, according to two people involved in those conversations.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the nation's best known progressive leader, said "defending and making excuses" for the Police Department was wrong, and that the mayor would be better served by trying to de-escalate tensions in the city.
"Running SUVs in crowds of people should never, ever be normalized," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. "No matter who does it, no matter why."
New York City, like many cities around the nation, was convulsed with furious protests after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis on Monday; the demonstrations came as the city was still under lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 20,000 lives in the city.
By Sunday evening, more than 786 people had been arrested in New York City, according to John Miller, the city's counterterrorism chief. Early Sunday morning, the police said 33 officers had been injured and 47 police vehicles had been damaged or destroyed, several of them set on fire. More than a dozen stores in Lower Manhattan were also looted.
Mr. de Blasio's response seemed like a careful balancing act: trying to support police officers who have been subject to violence themselves while also acknowledging the police abuses, especially against black and Hispanic men, that he highlighted as a major campaign issue when he first ran for mayor.
As a mayoral candidate in 2013, Mr. de Blasio vowed to reform a Police Department that, under his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, had prioritized using stop-and-frisk tactics against New Yorkers of color. Mr. de Blasio made his African-American wife, Chirlane McCray, and their children central to his campaign.
In one ad that was credited with winning over voters, his son, Dante de Blasio, tells viewers his father will "end a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color." (Mr. de Blasio would later echo the theme during his abortive run for the presidency, bragging that he was the only person on the debate stage who had been "raising a black son in America.")
By the time Mr. de Blasio entered City Hall, the work of ending stop-and-frisk had largely been accomplished; under immense legal and public pressure, Mr. Bloomberg drastically reduced the use of the practice during his final months in office.
But two major crises involving the Police Department immediately tested Mr. de Blasio's resolve.
That summer, police officers killed Eric Garner in Staten Island while arresting him for selling untaxed cigarettes. That episode was captured on camera, and Mr. Garner's final words, "I can't breathe," became a rallying cry for protesters around the country.
A Staten Island grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against the officer who used a chokehold against Mr. Garner; Mr. de Blasio angered the police when he sought to empathize with the Garner family and their supporters, disclosing how he had instructed Dante "on how to take special care" when dealing with the police, and described his own private worry over whether his son was safe at night.
Less than three weeks later, a man traveled from Baltimore to Brooklyn, seeking retribution for Mr. Garner's death. The man, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, fatally shot two police officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, while they sat in their patrol car.
The head of the city's largest police union said at the time that the mayor had blood on his hands. At the funerals for Officers Liu and Ramos, hundreds of rank-and-file officers turned their backs on the mayor.
The killings and their aftermath seemed to mark a turning point in Mr. de Blasio's relationship with the police. He sought to mend those rifts, softening his rhetoric and meeting with union officials to find common ground.
To the anger of some of his supporters, he resisted calls to fire the officer involved in the Garner death, Daniel Pantaleo, only doing so five years later after a police administrative judge found Mr. Pantaleo guilty of violating a department ban on chokeholds.
After Mr. Floyd was killed in Minneapolis last week, Mr. de Blasio was quick to denounce the death, saying that the officers involved should face criminal charges. But when protests against the killing erupted in New York, he was slower to respond, offering no plan or action to quell the tensions.
"When Eric Garner was killed, there was outreach to the family and the community was updated with response tactics for peaceful protests," said Rachel Noerdlinger, a former aide to Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray. "There was not this level of aggressive and illegal policing against protesters."
Ms. Noerdlinger has not criticized Mr. de Blasio since she left his administration more than five years ago. After watching his news conference in Brooklyn late Saturday night in which he addressed the protests, she said she woke up "with this feeling in my gut of just disappointment."
"New York City now looks worse than some other places with a nonprogressive mayor, quite frankly," Ms. Noerdlinger added.
Freddi Goldstein, the mayor's press secretary, said there was "no New York City mayor in modern history who has done more to reform the N.Y.P.D. and breed trust between police and communities" than Mr. de Blasio. She cited a reduction in arrests and implicit bias training.
"There is more work to be done, but you can't ignore the progress that's been made," Ms. Goldstein said.
Yet for other left-leaning New Yorkers who had already become disillusioned with Mr. de Blasio, the events of recent days were nonetheless disappointing.
"This is not what we campaigned on in 2013," said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, one of Mr. de Blasio's top advisers on his mayoral campaign.
Ms. Katz went on Twitter on Saturday to urge the mayor to "speak from the heart to this broken city." After the mayor addressed the media, she followed up: "This ... this was not what I meant."
Jonathan Rosen, once one of Mr. de Blasio's closest advisers, used two expletives on Twitter in reacting to the mayor's comments on Saturday; the day before, he had longingly suggested that the mayor and police commissioner of Atlanta could relocate to New York.
Richard R. Buery Jr., a former deputy mayor under Mr. de Blasio who is credited with implementing universal prekindergarten, the mayor's signature accomplishment, said in an interview that too much of the response to the incident was "about what the protesters are doing wrong."
"The problem here is that we know that if someone assaults the police, there is a reasonable expectation of justice and accountability," he said. "What these protests are about are that the opposite isn't true. If a black person is killed by the police, there can be no reasonable expectation that the police officer is going to be held accountable."
William J. Bratton, Mr. de Blasio's first police commissioner, said it was too soon to judge Mr. de Blasio's handling of this current crisis.
Mr. de Blasio, he said, is in the unenviable position of having to face several profound challenges at once, including a pandemic, a severe economic decline and the uncertainties surrounding the presidential election.
"It's like you have five, six, seven tornadoes all converging from different directions," Mr. Bratton said.
Mr. Bratton also said it is "extraordinarily difficult" to campaign as a police reformer and then have to maintain alliances with reform advocates after taking office.
"He's wrestled for six years with what is the right level of control," Mr. Bratton said.
On Sunday afternoon, the mayor addressed one piece of criticism leveled from, among others, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, who asked on Twitter in reference to a video of police clashes with protesters in Brooklyn, "Where is the mayor?"
Just before 5 p.m., Mr. de Blasio appeared in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, along with Councilman Robert E. Cornegy Jr., talking to residents about their concerns. He later headed to Flatbush, Brooklyn, to do the same with Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte.
As Mr. de Blasio has grappled with the protests, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who frequently asserts his control over New York City, has appeared cautious about injecting himself into the fray.
While he called the videos of the New York City protests disturbing and condemned the violence, he stopped short of passing judgment on the officers' actions, instead leaving it to the state attorney general to conduct a review and issue a report within 30 days.
"If that review looks at those videos and finds that there was improper police conduct, there will be ramifications," Mr. Cuomo said. "That is not going to be a report that just sits on the shelf. This is a moment of reform."

Full text: Major companies are often wary of conflict, especially in a polarized time. But some are now taking a stand on racial injustice and police violence.
As tensions flared around the country after George Floyd's death under a policeman's knee, protesters received support from an unexpected corner: corporate America.
Companies like Nike, Twitter and Citigroup have aligned themselves with the Black Lives Matter movement.
As Netflix posted on Twitter on Saturday: "To be silent is to be complicit. Black lives matter. We have a platform, and we have a duty to our Black members, employees, creators and talent to speak up."
Major companies are often wary of conflict, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects.
American advertisements often shy away from addressing political issues, like impeachment, and also steer clear of news stories about violence, drugs and, recently, the coronavirus pandemic.
But after Mr. Floyd died on Monday in Minneapolis, a wide range of companies began to take much more public stances on racial injustice and police violence.
Speaking out on social issues is often a calculated decision, a form of "values and identity-driven targeted marketing," said Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. By aligning corporate values with what customers care about, companies are hoping to build a sense of loyalty and a deeper sense of personal connection, he said.
"There's a general trend toward executives in the C-suite being called out and pressure-tested by consumers who want to know where they stand -- there's an opportunity to differentiate not just on function, on what's a better mousetrap, but on values," he said. "It's smart -- they're taking a stand, hopefully, because it's moral, but also because they understand the long-term economic game."
Twitter, which spent much of last week battling President Trump over the warnings and fact-checks it placed on several of his tweets, changed its profile image on the platform to black and added "#BlackLivesMatter" to its description.
Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citigroup, wrote a public blog post on the company's website that repeated Mr. Floyd's pleas to the white officer kneeling on his neck: "I can't breathe." The advertising agency 72andSunny wrote on Instagram that "white people need to start carrying this burden" of combating racism. Reebok said in a message to "the black community" that it "stands in solidarity with you," telling its social media followers: "We are not asking you to buy our shoes. We are asking you to walk in someone else's."
On Monday, Change.org will promote its largest petition ever -- "Justice for George Floyd" -- on taxi-top ads in New York and billboards there and in Minneapolis. The marketing campaign, funded by supporters, will be the most expensive effort of its kind for the company.
WarnerMedia brands, including HBO, TBS and the newly introduced HBO Max, changed their Twitter names to #BlackLivesMatter and quoted the black novelist James Baldwin: "Neither love nor terror makes one blind: indifference makes one blind."
The hashtag also appeared in posts from retailers like Nordstrom, the ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's and media companies like TikTok. YouTube promised to spend $ 1 million on social justice initiatives, but it quickly faced criticism that its moderation efforts against racist content have historically been weak.
"Your hypocrisy knows no bounds," wrote Sleeping Giants, a media watchdog group, in a reply to YouTube that echoed a similar complaint against Twitter. "As a platform that has done its very best to avoid having to remove any videos from racists, white supremacists and hate mongers, you should be ashamed of even tweeting about this. Too little, too late."
Some companies were more cautious in their approach. Target, which is based in Minneapolis and was hit by looting at a store there last week, described "a community in pain" in a blog post but never mentioned the word "black."
Several of the businesses that expressed support have had complicated relationships with race in the past. Starbucks, which conducted sweeping anti-bias training after two black men were arrested in a store in 2018, posted a public letter on Saturday encouraging "courageous conversations."
Nike, which has said that only 8 percent of its 353 vice presidents as of 2017 were black, released a new ad on Friday that was reposted by other shoe companies like Adidas and Converse. "For once, don't do it," the spot said, beseeching people to stop pretending "there's not a problem in America."
The company won awards for its 2018 marketing campaign, which featured the quarterback Colin Kaepernick telling viewers to "believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything,"
To many people, the supportive corporate sentiments fell short without offering funding or other substantive resources. But some companies said nothing at all.
Jackie Aina, an influencer with more than three million subscribers on YouTube, posted a video to Instagram last week urging fashion brands like Fashion Nova to weigh in on the nationwide protests. The brand said in a post on a secondary Instagram account this weekend that it was "appalled, angered and deeply saddened" and was "talking to a number of community leaders to identify and explore ways to take a stand and help."
In an interview, Ms. Aina said that she did not expect all companies to weigh in. But brands that borrow heavily from black culture and target black consumers have a responsibility, she said, to push for change, often by bringing more black employees into their ranks.
"When it comes to relevant things happening, things you can't ignore like the Black Life Matters movement, police brutality or murders in our community, it's crickets, and that's unacceptable," she said. "If you are capitalizing off of a culture, you're morally obligated to help them."

NEW YORK — On Friday night in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, protesters descended on an unoccupied New York Police Department van, which quickly became the target of all their anger and angst.
After chasing officers away, people threw rocks, glass bottles, and “anything and everything” at the van, according to one protester, who would only identify himself as Mike. After failing to turn over the vehicle, protesters set it on fire by burning their signs inside it, he said.
Soon, images and videos of the vehicle, with windows broken and engulfed in red flames, spread across social media during the first night of protests in New York City following the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him down by his neck for several minutes.
By Sunday morning, the department said that 47 police vehicles had been damaged during protests, 13 of them burned in ways that were similar to the attack on the first police van in Fort Greene, according to officials.
These vehicles have become the symbol of the unrest and have begun a debate over who is escalating the violence. Some protesters have cheered the destruction as a victory against law enforcement and a manifestation of the pent-up rage against the growing number of incidents of police brutality, while officials have said the damage is proof that a violent element is trying to hijack a tradition of peaceful protest in the city.
“No place in America has protected protests more than New York City,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday. “And we will continue to do so whatever someone’s views but it has to be nonviolent. We honor the tradition of civil disobedience.”
In Union Square on Saturday, protesters climbed onto a Police Department vehicle, which had a shattered windshield and lights blaring, as onlookers cheered. One image on social media from Brooklyn on Saturday night showed a cyclist taking a selfie in front of a department vehicle that had a broken windshield and was covered in black spray paint.
At least four people have been charged in connection with Molotov-cocktail attacks on police vehicles.
A woman from the Catskills region, Samantha Shader, 27, was arrested on charges that she had thrown a firebomb at a police van in Brooklyn on Friday, the police said. Her 21-year-old sister, Darian Shader, interfered with the arrest and was also taken into custody, the police said.
Minutes after that first firebomb on Friday, the police said Urooj Rahman, 31, and Colinford King Mattis, 32, coordinated a Molotov-cocktail attack on an empty police vehicle, and ignited a small blaze in the back seat. Both were arrested.
The total cost of the vehicle damage Saturday night alone “is estimated to be in excess of $750,000 and expected to go up,” said Sgt. Mary Frances O’Donnell, a spokeswoman for the department.
One encounter between protesters and a police vehicle has become a flashpoint in the debate over who is to blame for the escalating violence.
Around 8 p.m. Saturday, two Police Department vehicles drove through a crowd of protesters, scattering dozens of people who had surrounded the cars, according to videos of the incident and accounts from bystanders.
“I wish the officers found a different approach,” de Blasio told reporters Saturday night, but he added that “the protesters in that video did the wrong thing to surround that police car, period.”
He said the police had seen that tactic before in the past two days, and it could be “very, very dangerous to everyone involved.” He said the incident would be investigated.
One witness to the incident said the scene in Prospect Heights had, initially, been peaceful.
Ede Fox, 48, said she was sitting in her parked car on Flatbush Avenue when suddenly the protest turned chaotic when a police SUV sped down the avenue behind the crowd. “They only seemed to stoke the fires rather than de-escalate,” said Fox, who formerly worked in city government and ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 2017. “When they pushed into the crowd, I was stunned.”
Soon protesters began to throw plastic water bottles and other items, including orange cones, at the vehicle.
Another police SUV arrived, moving through the crowd. The first vehicle, which was stalled in front of a barricade and a line of protesters, suddenly lurched forward at a high speed. People scattered, officers got out of the SUV, and a protester walked up to the vehicle and busted a window. There were no injuries reported.
In an interview Sunday, Fox said she had become frightened. “To be honest, I thought this was a moment that the officers would start shooting or the protesters would start a fire.”
A protester jumped atop the SUV and appeared to be pleading with others to be peaceful, Fox said. “I think she was telling people to stop being violent,” she said.

WASHINGTON — Despite an 11 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and the activation of the National Guard, protests near the White House fueled by anger over the police killing of George Floyd spiraled out of control again Sunday night.
Demonstrators were hit in the head with canisters of tear gas. Protesters broke into offices. Others started fires, one of which may have spread to the basement of St. John’s, the Episcopal church that has been attended at least once by every chief executive going back to James Madison. Firefighters soon put out the flames.
Hundreds of people surged in front of the White House for a third consecutive night. At 8 p.m., troops could be seen marching across the South Lawn as President Donald Trump sat inside, tweeting about law and order.
The protesters reclaimed a slice of Lafayette Park that had been the dividing line with the police Saturday night. As they got closer to the White House, teenagers covered a park bathroom structure in graffiti like “AMERIKKKA” and climbed atop for a better view. The police periodically lobbed tear gas into the crowd and announced over a megaphone their intent to push the protesters back. But as night fell, they had yet to succeed.
But as the evening continued, the demonstrations turned into a repeat of the previous night. The police reclaimed ground in the park, and the crowds retreated to H Street. There, they started a giant bonfire in front of St. John’s Church. The bathroom structure in the park was also set ablaze. On I Street, a car burned.
Sunday began with workers scrambling to secure businesses in the heart of the nation’s capital, before what many feared may be another night of fury over Floyd’s killing.
“I was called at two o’clock in the morning and again this morning,” said Bryant Woltz, a glass contractor boarding up the Bombay Club, ordinarily the scene of power lunches between politicians and the media elite. “They said we need all hands on deck, this is an emergency.”
Across from the Bombay Club, another restaurant, the Oval Room, was graffitied with “THE RICH AREN’T SAFE ANYMORE!” Nearby at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building, which had been set on fire and had its windows smashed, Bill Voge, 35, was hastily slapping gray paint over more graffiti. “We’re trying to recover as best we can from what transpired last night, and then tonight it’s supposed to be the same thing, so we’ll probably be back tomorrow, doing the same thing,” he said, paint roller in hand.
The Saturday protests had begun peacefully at 2 p.m., opposite the Justice Department. “We want charges,” an organizer shouted into a megaphone. “We want convictions. No more acquittals. We want these people to be held accountable.” Protesters marched down to the National Mall, snaked around the Reflecting Pool and came to a stop at the statue of Ulysses S. Grant on horseback. There, with the Capitol building in the background, they chanted “George Floyd!” and the names of other victims of police brutality, including Breonna Taylor and Philando Castile.
“We built this country, and it’s time for people to respect us,” said Pamela Alston, 31, an insurance underwriter from Southeast Washington. Jarrell Slade, 26, a school counselor and Washington native, said: “I’m fed up. I’m tired of going on social media, talking to my friends and family, and having everything be centered on black death.”
Malik Harris, 23, a global studies major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, rented a house in Washington with friends for the weekend to join the protest. “I’m supposed to be doing my homework right now for the summer semester,” he said. “But I definitely want to be present for everything.”
Later in the afternoon, crowds swelled on H Street near the White House and then took off through the streets. They marched past the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, blaring NWA. They enveloped traffic on Constitution Avenue. Every car honked in solidarity. Marco Silva, 28, was driving a “College Hunks” moving service truck when he was swarmed. But he was not bothered. Hopping out to light a cigarette and pump his fist in the air, he said: “I think this is beautiful. What everybody is doing right now is a beautiful thing.”
A significant portion of the demonstrators were white, and they joined with the largely African-American crowd to protest police aggression. Cameron McCall, 23, a self-described social media influencer, helped organize the protest, with an emphasis on peace, and said: “We’ve seen that we have a strong voice on social media with our generation, and look at us now, united, walking, and off our phones. Beyond shoes and clothes and celebrities, we are doing it for a purpose.”
As the day progressed, marchers knelt near the National Museum of African American History and Culture for nine minutes of silence, around the time that Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck in Minneapolis. As they moved on past the World War II Memorial, they urged tourists to join them. The sun began to dip as they rested at the Lincoln Memorial.
President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House on Saturday evening after a day at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, had suggested in a tweet that Saturday would be “MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE” and that his supporters might turn out in their red “Make America Great Again” caps. But there were no red caps to be seen among a sea of hundreds flooding H Street.
By 9 p.m., tensions between police and a growing crowd of protesters broke out, with demonstrators wresting the barricades from police, who in turn volleyed canisters of tear gas into the crowd.
“Water with baking soda helps,” said Azzah Davis, 19, who was kneeling in a nearby alley trying to recover from the gas. “We were protesting, I don’t want to say peacefully, because things were getting out of control, and the cops were shooting people with rubber bullets. They started throwing mace and people picked it up and threw it back.” She added: “It’s very long overdue. We have been peaceful long enough.”
A flaming dumpster illuminated police as some demonstrators hurled bricks and other projectiles their way. Despite the pandemic, many people in the crowd had no choice but to discard their masks to cough and sneeze as the acrid tang of tear gas whipped up and down the block.
Sarah Cooper, a 27-year-old accountant, was holding a sign that mentioned COVID-19. “It’s a systemic issue. Black people are more likely to die from COVID-19,” she said. After three hours in front of the White House, she added, “it’s kind of disorganized, but I think it’s nice that people are still coming out to push for change.”
By 11 p.m., a Chevy Suburban on I Street was in flames and the crowds fanned out, smashing windows and trying to wreck as much as they could.
By 5 p.m. Sunday, there were already hundreds of people protesting outside the White House.

Police fired tear gas near the White House on Sunday night to dissuade protesters who had smashed the windows of prominent buildings, overturned cars and set fires, with smoke seen rising from near the Washington Monument.
The White House went dark, turning off almost all of its external lights, as protesters seethed in dozens of cities, again defying curfews to demonstrate against police brutality following the death of George Floyd in police custody.
It was the sixth day of nationwide unrest since the death of Floyd last week in Minneapolis.
Mayors imposed curfews and several governors mobilized the National Guard, but that did not quell widespread protests in cities across the country, some of them marked by violence and looting.
— In Birmingham, Alabama, protesters started to tear down a Confederate monument that the city had previously covered with a tarp amid a lawsuit between the state attorney general and the city.
— In Boston, a police SUV was set ablaze near the State House, sending up a column of black smoke after a large group of protesters had mostly dispersed.
— In Philadelphia, police officers in riot gear and an armored vehicle used pepper spray to try to repel rioters and looters. A wall of officers blocked an entrance ramp to Interstate 676 in the city, where the mass transit system suspending service starting at 6 p.m. as part of a citywide curfew.
— In New York, demonstrators marched across the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges, snarling traffic. The Manhattan Bridge was briefly shut down to car traffic. Chaos erupted in Union Square at around 10 p.m., with flames leaping up two stories from trash cans and piles of street debris. The night before in Union Square, the mayor’s daughter, Chiara de Blasio, 25, was among the protesters arrested, according to a police official.
— In Chicago, the police superintendent, David Brown, excoriated the looters on Sunday as Gov. J.B. Pritzker activated the National Guard at the city’s request.
— In Louisville, Kentucky, a tense confrontation in the middle of a crowded street was partially defused when a black woman stepped forward and offered a policeman in riot gear a hug. They embraced for nearly a minute.
What Times reporters are witnessing on the ground.
Washington
Tonight, the city police widened the perimeter, blocking of streets as a mile away from the White House while police in riot gear confronted protesters in the north section of Lafayette Square.
Hundreds of protesters remained from earlier demonstrations in the day, surging and chanting and pushing against the line of police, then falling back. Some threw water bottles, set off fireworks and torched at least one vehicle.
Soon after St. John’s Church, the so-called “church of presidents” where every chief executive going back to James Madison has worshipped, soon erupted in flames in the basement.
Businesses nearby boarded up after damage from the night before, including the iconic Hay Adams Hotel and the Oval Room restaurant. Businesses far away from the White House boarded up to protect themselves as well. Helicopters hovered overhead. — PETER BAKER
Oakland, California
Close to downtown, a few hundred protesters peacefully marched through the streets, chanting and carrying signs.
Behind the diverse crowd, Donavon Butler, 33, drove a white minivan with his wife and four children inside. His 5-year-old son, Chase, hung out the back window with his right fist raised and his left hand holding a cardboard sign that said “Mama! I can’t breath. Don’t shoot.”
“The world we live in is not equal. People look at us different,” Butler said he told his son. — JACK NICAS
Minneapolis
Steps from the 3rd Precinct police station that protesters stormed Thursday night is Stanford Middle School. The pandemic had closed the school since March, but students were still able to receive school lunches. Now, the unrest has made the building inaccessible and shops and supermarkets shuttered, leaving hundreds of the school’s students potentially without food.
Volunteers and school staff jumped into action to start a food drive. Donations included loaves of bread, apples, carrots, rice and beans.
“It is like viral beyond all comprehension,” said Amy Nelson, the school principal. Donations started at 10 a.m. and within a few hours, she said, there was enough food to fill several trailer trucks. — MATT FURBER
Atlanta
The demonstrators stopped, hundreds of them, black and white, and they sat. A self-appointed leader among them, an entrepreneur named John Wade, praised them for their nonviolence. But he warned them not to keep marching up the hill. The cops were up there fighting it out, he said, with “the non-compliant people.”
The organizers told everyone to turn off Centennial Olympic Park Drive, and veer away from the trouble. A police officer told them not to walk forward.
Then the tear gas started.
People chanted the way they do at Atlanta ball games, riffing on the old song “Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.”
“We ready, We ready, We ready, for y’all,” they sang. — RICHARD FAUSSET
Two Atlanta police officers were fired for using excessive force during a protest.
Two Atlanta police officers were fired on Sunday, one day after videos emerged showing them using stun guns on two black college students and then dragging them out of their car.
Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, announced the dismissal of the two officers, whom she did not name, during a news conference Sunday. She said their actions had constituted “excessive force.”
Bottoms said three other officers who were involved in the arrests had been reassigned to desk duty while the department reviews their actions.
“It was disturbing on many levels, the least of not which was that there clearly was an excessive use of force,” Bottoms said. “We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress, but we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.”
Bottoms said she had reviewed police body camera footage of the confrontation and that it should be released immediately. The episode was broadcast live on local television Saturday night, showing a group of officers stopping a man and woman in their car near downtown Atlanta roughly 45 minutes after a curfew went into effect at 9 p.m. It was unclear what prompted the police to stop the car.
The actions of the Atlanta officers came amid intensifying scrutiny of how law enforcement was responding to demonstrators.
Chief Erika Shields of the Atlanta Police Department condemned the actions of the officers, saying that the two students had been “manhandled” and that the episode had only underscored the fear and wariness minorities have of the police.
“I am genuinely sorry,” Shields said. “This is not who we are. This is not what we’re about.”
The actions of the Atlanta officers came amid intensifying scrutiny of how law enforcement was responding to demonstrators.
In New York City, two police SUVs plowed into protesters Saturday evening.
In Salt Lake City, officers in riot gear trying to clear onlookers shoved an older man with a cane to the ground. And in Minneapolis, a video appeared to show officers yelling at people on their porches to get inside and firing paint canisters at them when they did not. “Light them up,” one officer said.
National Guard commanders say troops are meant only to keep the peace.
As Trump painted the National Guard as key to restoring order and taunted Democratic governors and mayors for not calling out the troops, generals in charge of troops in three states said Sunday afternoon that they had been only in support roles and had not used any force to put down the civil unrest.
The leaders of the Minnesota, Georgia and Colorado National Guards made clear that while troops had probably had a deterrent effect, the bulk of the credit for containing the violence went to local police officers. National Guard forces have been used mostly to secure buildings, allowing more police officers to move to the front lines, they said.
“Our purpose is to allow our local law enforcement professionals to do their jobs,” said Gen. Jon Jensen, leader of Minnesota’s National Guard. “We do that by relieving them of items like infrastructure security.”
The forces in Minnesota and Georgia are armed, while the Colorado troops have only nonlethal weaponry. The generals did not describe under what conditions they would use force, only that they would be proportional and used in self-defense.
Jensen said he had requested additional military police battalions from the National Guard forces of neighboring states, but said he would not recommend the Minnesota governor request regular Army forces for that job, as Trump has offered.
Army Maj. Gen. Thomas Carden Jr., the adjutant general of the Georgia National Guard, expressed dismay that his forces had to be called out for a domestic civil unrest mission.
“We in America should not get used to or accept uniformed service members of any variety having to be put in a position where they are having to secure people inside the United States of America,” Carden said. “While we are honored to do it, this is a sign of the times that we have to do better as a country.”
Looters strike Philadelphia stores while peaceful crowds protest at City Hall.
Videos posted on social media showed looting and vandalism to storefronts in parts of Philadelphia on Sunday afternoon, even as hundreds of people protested peacefully outside City Hall.
Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia called the looters “anarchists” at a midday news conference, hours before all retail stores in Philadelphia were closed Sunday afternoon. For a second night, a citywide curfew was imposed, set for 6 p.m.
The peaceful protesters’ message about racism and use of force by the police “in no way should be diminished by anarchists and others who tried to cause chaos in our city last night,” Kenney said at the news conference, adding that the instigators “did a great disservice to the many others who chose to speak out forcefully against institutional racism and violence at the hands of the police.”
Streets in the Center City business district were closed starting at noon to allow cleanup from the previous night’s protests. Mass transit service was curtailed.
Pennsylvania joined several states that moved to make it easier to activate the National Guard this weekend, and the city, along with suburban Montgomery County, asked for help from the Guard on Sunday, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
A disaster is declared in Texas, while in Florida, reopenings are delayed
As cities and states brace for more demonstrations in the coming days, authorities have responded by calling in more resources and readjusting previously held plans.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster Sunday, an action that enables him to designate federal agents to serve as Texas peace officers. The Republican governor, who activated the Texas National Guard a day earlier, issued the disaster order after protests in the state’s major cities touched off confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement.
“As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety and protect against property damage or loss,” Abbott said in announcing the disaster declaration. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest, and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” he said. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive.”
And in South Florida, Mayor Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County postponed the planned reopening of beaches following the lockdown because of the pandemic. Miami-Dade beaches had been scheduled to open Monday.
“The beaches will remain closed until the curfew order is lifted,” Gimenez said in a statement Sunday. He cited an emergency order he signed Saturday imposing a countywide curfew after a small group of protesters set police cars on fire outside the Miami Police Department’s downtown headquarters.
The beach reopenings would have involved a significant police presence. Condominium pools and hotels in the county will be allowed to reopen Monday as planned.

In Boston, thousands of people took to streets and parks in peaceful protests against police brutality. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck sped into a crowd on a highway overpass as hundreds of demonstrators scattered for safety. And in New York, a tense mood followed a night of street battles, burned cars and hundreds of arrests.
The United States remained a tinderbox of emotion, anger and continued violence Sunday, the sixth day of nationwide unrest since the death of yet another black man at the hands of the police. The death of the man, George Floyd, last week in Minneapolis set off days of protracted protests.
In Santa Monica, California, looters shoved aside barricades to vandalize and ransack stores Sunday, while in nearby Huntington Beach, protesters against police brutality clashed with right-wing groups. And in Louisville, Kentucky, a tense confrontation in the middle of a crowded street was partially defused when a black woman stepped forward and offered a policeman in riot gear a hug. They embraced for nearly a minute.
The police, and the protests, were far more combative elsewhere. Crowds ran through the streets breaking windows blocks from the White House, where a demonstration Friday night had so unnerved the Secret Service that agents abruptly rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunkerused in the past during terrorist attacks.
Philadelphia announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew after a day of protests and looting there, while Washington’s mayor set one for 11 p.m. and Arizona’s governor declared a state of emergency and ordered a nightly 8 p.m. curfew that he said would be in place for a week
At least 75 cities have seen protests in recent days, and the number of mayors and governors imposing curfews — already more than two dozen — continued to grow. It is the first time so many local leaders have simultaneously issued such orders in the face of civic unrest since 1968, after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
On Saturday, hundreds of people were arrested across the country as clashes erupted between protesters and the police in dozens of states. In some cities, the authorities appeared to fire rubber bullets and other projectiles with little or no provocation. In New York City, two police vehicles surged forward into a crowd of demonstrators, some of whom were blocking the street and pelting the cars with debris.
National Guard soldiers were posted in Atlanta and Minneapolis and California moved troops into Los Angeles.
Sunday’s protests marked the sixth day of outrage since Floyd died as a white police officer — since fired and charged with third-degree murder — pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
Two Atlanta police officers were fired for using excessive force during a protest.
Two Atlanta police officers were fired on Sunday, one day after videos emerged showing them using stun guns on two black college students and then dragging them out of their car.
Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, announced the dismissal of the two officers, whom she did not name, during a news conference Sunday. She said their actions had constituted “excessive force.”
Bottoms said three other officers who were involved in the arrests had been reassigned to desk duty while the department reviews their actions.
“It was disturbing on many levels, the least of not which was that there clearly was an excessive use of force,” Bottoms said. “We understand that our officers are working very long hours under an enormous amount of stress, but we also understand that the use of excessive force is never acceptable.”
Bottoms said she had reviewed police body camera footage of the confrontation and that it should be released immediately. The episode was broadcast live on local television Saturday night, showing a group of officers stopping a man and woman in their car near downtown Atlanta roughly 45 minutes after a curfew went into effect at 9 p.m. It was unclear what prompted the police to stop the car.
Chief Erika Shields of the Atlanta Police Department condemned the actions of the officers, saying that the two students had been “manhandled” and that the episode had only underscored the fear and wariness minorities have of the police.
“I am genuinely sorry,” Shields said. “This is not who we are. This is not what we’re about.”
The actions of the Atlanta officers came amid intensifying scrutiny of how law enforcement was responding to demonstrators.
In New York City, two police SUVs plowed into protesters Saturday evening.
In Salt Lake City, officers in riot gear trying to clear onlookers shoved an older man with a cane to the ground. And in Minneapolis, a video appeared to show officers yelling at people on their porches to get inside and firing paint canisters at them when they did not. “Light them up,” one officer said.
National Guard commanders say troops are meant only to keep the peace.
As Trump painted the National Guard as key to restoring order and taunted Democratic governors and mayors for not calling out the troops, generals in charge of troops in three states said Sunday afternoon that they had been only in support roles and had not used any force to put down the civil unrest.
The leaders of the Minnesota, Georgia and Colorado National Guards made clear that while troops had probably had a deterrent effect, the bulk of the credit for containing the violence went to local police officers. National Guard forces have been used mostly to secure buildings, allowing more police officers to move to the front lines, they said.
“Our purpose is to allow our local law enforcement professionals to do their jobs,” said Gen. Jon Jensen, leader of Minnesota’s National Guard. “We do that by relieving them of items like infrastructure security.”
The forces in Minnesota and Georgia are armed, while the Colorado troops have only nonlethal weaponry. The generals did not describe under what conditions they would use force, only that they would be proportional and used in self-defense.

NEW YORK — The brief video clip, widely circulated on social media and on the national news, seemed to capture a wanton act of police brutality: One police cruiser, and then a second, jolting into a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn, sending people sprawling across the street.
But Mayor Bill de Blasio’s conflicted response to the incident highlighted the challenges he has faced in managing a crisis rooted in issues he has long pledged to tackle in New York City: racial discrimination, police abuses and inequality.
At a news conference Sunday, the mayor called for an investigation, but also took pains to try to explain the officers’ actions, saying that the situation “was created by a group of protesters blocking and surrounding a police vehicle, a tactic that we had seen before in the last few days, a tactic that can be very, very dangerous to everyone involved.”
He added: “And we’ve seen direct attacks on police officers, including in their vehicles.”
At different points in his tenure, de Blasio’s efforts to turn his campaign pledges into policy and practice have been stymied, often frustrating many in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, whose dissatisfaction with the mayor has mounted.
Several of his former aides took the remarkable step of voicing their displeasure publicly on Twitter, in addition to privately discussing the mayor’s actions in a separate thread, according to two people involved in those conversations.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the nation’s best known progressive leader, said “defending and making excuses” for the Police Department was wrong, and that the mayor would be better served by trying to de-escalate tensions in the city.
“Running SUVs in crowds of people should never, ever be normalized,” Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “No matter who does it, no matter why.”
New York City, like many cities around the nation, was convulsed with furious protests after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis on Monday; the demonstrations came as the city was still under lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 20,000 lives in the city.
By Sunday evening, more than 786 people had been arrested in New York City, according to John Miller, the city’s counterterrorism chief. Early Sunday morning, the police said 33 officers had been injured and 47 police vehicles had been damaged or destroyed, several of them set on fire. More than a dozen stores in Lower Manhattan were also looted.
De Blasio’s response seemed like a careful balancing act: trying to support police officers who have been subject to violence themselves while also acknowledging the police abuses, especially against black and Hispanic men, that he highlighted as a major campaign issue when he first ran for mayor.
As a mayoral candidate in 2013, de Blasio vowed to reform a Police Department that, under his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, had prioritized using stop-and-frisk tactics against New Yorkers of color. De Blasio made his African American wife, Chirlane McCray, and their children central to his campaign.
In one ad that was credited with winning over voters, his son, Dante de Blasio, tells viewers his father will “end a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color.” (De Blasio would later echo the theme during his abortive run for the presidency, bragging that he was the only person on the debate stage who had been “raising a black son in America.”)
By the time de Blasio entered City Hall, the work of ending stop-and-frisk had largely been accomplished; under immense legal and public pressure, Bloomberg drastically reduced the use of the practice during his final months in office.
But two major crises involving the Police Department immediately tested de Blasio’s resolve.
That summer, police officers killed Eric Garner in Staten Island while arresting him for selling untaxed cigarettes. That episode was captured on camera, and Garner’s final words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for protesters around the country.
A Staten Island grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against the officer who used a chokehold against Garner; de Blasio angered the police when he sought to empathize with the Garner family and their supporters, disclosing how he had instructed Dante “on how to take special care” when dealing with the police, and described his own private worry over whether his son was safe at night.
Less than three weeks later, a man traveled from Baltimore to Brooklyn, seeking retribution for Garner’s death. The man, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, fatally shot two police officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, while they sat in their patrol car.
The head of the city’s largest police union said at the time that the mayor had blood on his hands. At the funerals for Liu and Ramos, hundreds of rank-and-file officers turned their backs on the mayor.
The killings and their aftermath seemed to mark a turning point in de Blasio’s relationship with the police. He sought to mend those rifts, softening his rhetoric and meeting with union officials to find common ground.
To the anger of some of his supporters, he resisted calls to fire the officer involved in the Garner death, Daniel Pantaleo, only doing so five years later after a police administrative judge found Pantaleo guilty of violating a department ban on chokeholds.
After Floyd was killed in Minneapolis last week, de Blasio was quick to denounce the death, saying that the officers involved should face criminal charges. But when protests against the killing erupted in New York, he was slower to respond, offering no plan or action to quell the tensions.
“When Eric Garner was killed, there was outreach to the family and the community was updated with response tactics for peaceful protests,” said Rachel Noerdlinger, a former aide to de Blasio and McCray. “There was not this level of aggressive and illegal policing against protesters.”
Noerdlinger has not criticized de Blasio since she left his administration more than five years ago. After watching his news conference in Brooklyn late Saturday night in which he addressed the protests, she said she woke up “with this feeling in my gut of just disappointment.”
“New York City now looks worse than some other places with a nonprogressive mayor, quite frankly,” Noerdlinger added.
Freddi Goldstein, the mayor’s press secretary, said there was “no New York City mayor in modern history who has done more to reform the NYPD and breed trust between police and communities” than de Blasio. She cited a reduction in arrests and implicit bias training.
“There is more work to be done, but you can’t ignore the progress that’s been made,” Goldstein said.
Yet for other left-leaning New Yorkers who had already become disillusioned with de Blasio, the events of recent days were nonetheless disappointing.
“This is not what we campaigned on in 2013,” said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, one of de Blasio’s top advisers on his mayoral campaign.
Katz went on Twitter on Saturday to urge the mayor to “speak from the heart to this broken city.” After the mayor addressed the media, she followed up: “This … this was not what I meant.”
Jonathan Rosen, once one of de Blasio’s closest advisers, used two expletives on Twitter in reacting to the mayor’s comments Saturday; the day before, he had longingly suggested that the mayor and police commissioner of Atlanta could relocate to New York.
Richard R. Buery Jr., a former deputy mayor under de Blasio who is credited with implementing universal prekindergarten, the mayor’s signature accomplishment, said in an interview that too much of the response to the incident was “about what the protesters are doing wrong.”
“The problem here is that we know that if someone assaults the police, there is a reasonable expectation of justice and accountability,” he said. “What these protests are about are that the opposite isn’t true. If a black person is killed by the police, there can be no reasonable expectation that the police officer is going to be held accountable.”
William J. Bratton, de Blasio’s first police commissioner, said it was too soon to judge de Blasio’s handling of this current crisis.
De Blasio, he said, is in the unenviable position of having to face several profound challenges at once, including a pandemic, a severe economic decline and the uncertainties surrounding the presidential election.
“It’s like you have five, six, seven tornadoes all converging from different directions,” Bratton said.
Bratton also said it is “extraordinarily difficult” to campaign as a police reformer and then have to maintain alliances with reform advocates after taking office.
“He’s wrestled for six years with what is the right level of control,” Bratton said.
On Sunday afternoon, the mayor addressed one piece of criticism leveled from, among others, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, who asked on Twitter in reference to a video of police clashes with protesters in Brooklyn, “Where is the mayor?”
Just before 5 p.m., de Blasio appeared in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, along with Councilman Robert E. Cornegy Jr., talking to residents about their concerns. He later headed to Flatbush, Brooklyn, to do the same with Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte.
As de Blasio has grappled with the protests, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who frequently asserts his control over New York City, has appeared cautious about injecting himself into the fray.
While he called the videos of the New York City protests disturbing and condemned the violence, he stopped short of passing judgment on the officers’ actions, instead leaving it to the state attorney general to conduct a review and issue a report within 30 days.
“If that review looks at those videos and finds that there was improper police conduct, there will be ramifications,” Cuomo said. “That is not going to be a report that just sits on the shelf. This is a moment of reform.”
