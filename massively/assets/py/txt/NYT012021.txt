Full text: More than ever, this month is a welcome time for the education and celebration of Black American culture.
It's not an understatement to describe the events of the past year as historic, and particularly for Black Americans. The nation elected its first Black vice president, a woman and a graduate of a historically Black university, and Georgia send its first Black senator to the Capitol. (Both of these realities were possible through the tireless organizing efforts of women like Stacey Abrams of Fair Fight and LaTosha Brown of Black Voters Matter.)
This period also had Black Americans experiencing disproportionate deaths and job losses from Covid-19, police brutality and myriad race-fueled attacks. The killing of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody, ushered in a period of collective reckoning -- one that prompted widespread protests, a push for racial justice and a re-examination of the education system's failure to teach the accurate history of Black and Indigenous people.
As Black History Month kicks off, there may not be a physical coming together, but there are numerous cultural events in which to take part.
'Judas and the Black Messiah' and 'One Night in Miami'
This awards season brings us two celebrated films from Black directors about pivotal moments in history. Shaka King's "Judas and the Black Messiah" focuses on the rise in power of the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), and the betrayal that led to his death at the hands of the F.B.I. The directorial debut of Regina King, "One Night in Miami" is centered on the night of Cassius Clay's famed upset of Sonny Liston in 1964, making Clay (before he became known as Muhammad Ali) the heavyweight champion of the world. The film also imagines a meeting among Clay, Malcolm X, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke, during which they have a heated debate about the civil rights movement. "Judas and the Black Messiah" is in select theaters Feb. 12 and streaming on HBO Max; "One Night in Miami" is currently in select theaters and streaming on Amazon Prime.
'Men of Change: Taking It to the Streets' exhibition by the Anacostia Community Museum, Washington
An exploration and celebration of world-changing African-American men, both famous and not so, was designed for the gallery of the Anacostia Community Museum before health considerations caused it to be revamped for the outdoors. Now, the exhibition graces two blocks in the Deanwood neighborhood, between a recreational center and Ron Brown College Preparatory High School. "Men of Change" explores American history through the contributions of figures like James Baldwin, W.E.B. DuBois, Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ryan Coogler. A virtual panel for the exhibition's opening moderated by CNN's Omar Jimenez will discuss how Black men embrace creativity amid systemic racism. Jimenez will be joined by Dr. Rob Gore, who started the youth empowerment movement Kings Against Violence Initiative (and who is also featured in the exhibition), the architect Jonathan Jackson and the artist Tariku Shiferaw. Feb. 1-May 31, 4800 Meade St., NE, Washington, D.C.; opening panel discussion, Feb. 6, 1 p.m., smithsonian.zoom.us/webinar/register
'The Motherlode: 100+ Women Who Made Hip-Hop'
The author and journalist Clover Hope's enthralling book gives female architects of hip-hop their long awaited dues. The stories of Lil' Kim, Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill and Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes are highlighted, alongside less-celebrated heroes like MC Lyte and Roxanne Shanté. Hope gives tremendous context to the contributions of the multitalented Black women who were all too often denied the credit they deserved. Greenlight Bookstore in New York will be holding a Feb. 3 book lopening featuring Hope, the illustrator Rachelle Baker and the music journalist Briana Younger. greenlightbookstore.com/event
Association for the Study of African-American Life and History's Virtual Festival
Fully virtual this year for the first time, ASALH's 95th annual Black History Month festival will examine the theme "The Black Family: Representation, Identity and Diversity." Events open to the public include an author talk with the former astronaut Mae Jemison, a discussion on "How African-American Families Have Been Portrayed in the Media" and music from H.B.C.U. choirs. The marquee event (which is ticketed) is a conversation between Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the group's president, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, on the search for family roots within Black history. The organization was founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, who instituted Negro History Week (a precursor to Black History Month), tied to the February birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. asalh.org/festival
The 35th Annual Brooklyn Tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Held on Martin Luther King's Birthday and online for the first time this year, the annual Brooklyn Academy of Music event featured a keynote address from Alicia Garza, a founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network; musical performances from PJ Morton, Tarriona "Tank" Ball and the choir Sing Harlem; along with poetry from Ashley August and Timothy DuWhite. Political appearances included Letitia James, the New York attorney general; Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York; as well as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. Available to stream through the month of February. bam.org/mlktribute
'Four Hundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019'
After the killing last year of George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis, Ibram X. Kendi's 2019 book "How to Be an Antiracist," soared up the best-seller list. In February, Kendi, the director of the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University, and the historian Keisha N. Blain will release "Four Hundred Souls," a historical retelling they assembled by 90 writers, each examining a five-year period in Black American history. On Feb. 1, the two editors will kick off the book release with a discussion of the work alongside the fellow writers Isabel Wilkerson, Clint Smith and Kiese Laymon. eventbrite.com
Black History Month in the Parks
Join the Urban Park Rangers for a series of distanced outdoor events in New York's Central Park that will explore the city's Black history. One walking tour focuses on Seneca Village, which was a neighborhood of predominantly African-American property owners in the pre-Central Park 1800s, while another discusses the sanctuary that the area provided for people escaping slavery via the Underground Railroad. For more modern history, check out Feb. 27's gathering, which will look at how a recreational room party in the Bronx birthed hip-hop, when its growing crowd spilled over to what is now known as Cedar Playground. nycgovparks.org/events/black_history_month
Flowering Forest: A Tree Tribute to John Lewis
The death of Representative John Lewis in July was a tremendous loss to both his city, Atlanta, and the legacy of the civil rights movement, of which he was a longtime hero -- Lewis was just 25 when he was beaten at a voting rights march in Selma, Ala. Atlanta will be honoring him in Freedom Park with a living memorial made up of shrubs, daffodil fields and more than 300 blooming trees. The multiyear project begins Feb. 19 as a three-day volunteer planting project, finishing on the 21st, which was the Lewis's birthday. The plants are intended to bloom annually around that time, honoring his memory year after year. treesatlanta.org/johnlewis/

Despite President Joe Biden’s plea to let our “better angels prevail” and comedian Dave Chappelle’s “Saturday Night Live” monologue when he told Americans, “We have to forgive each other,” reconciliation and forgiveness can be a long, difficult process. I learned that the hard way when the person who hurt me most wouldn’t apologize or express any remorse.
I’d always thought I was the type who could forgive anyone for anything. But when the mentor I’d trusted for 15 years lied to me and refused to explain or atone, I was inconsolable.
Then I took a cross-country trip to try to heal our rift, hoping to learn more about forgiveness along the way by writing a book about it. As research, I interviewed therapists, experts from different religions, and people who had suffered terrible wrongs. They taught me that there are many ways to find repentance and resolution.
Here are some of the strategies they used, which may also help you get the apology you seek.
Explore what really happened and why
“Before reacting, calmly ask questions and gather more information about what occurred, which can be illuminating,” said Patricia Gross, a therapist in New York City.
“Oftentimes a rupture is caused by miscommunication or misunderstandings that can be clarified and fixed.”
Express your hurt in a letter
Deborah Copaken, a journalist in New York City, wrote to the man who had raped her 30 years before, reminding him of what he did and how hard it’s been for her to overcome. He responded immediately by confessing he didn’t remember it. He’d blacked out that night from excessive drinking and had entered Alcoholics Anonymous. As he kept saying he was sorry, “Thirty years of pain and grief fell out of me,” she wrote.
Decide if something else can compensate
Emanuel Mandel, an 84-year-old Washington therapist and Holocaust survivor, never accepted the German government’s apology on behalf of the Nazis who wiped out his grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts. Yet he admitted that $1,000 payments in war reparations his father negotiated through the Claims Conference helped his parents reestablish themselves in America and have better lives. This is why compensatory damages are awarded in legal cases, though money isn’t the only way to make amends.
Suggest alternative reparations
Admitting that you feel wounded or insulted is a better strategy than using combative rhetoric to accuse the other person of inflicting pain, according to Dr. Vatsal G. Thakkar, a psychiatrist in Connecticut.
Bernard Mokam, who recently graduated from New York University, said that after the killing of George Floyd, a fellow Black man in Minneapolis, by a white police officer last May, a white classmate sent him $30 over Venmo. She may have meant to show compassion, but he was comfortable financially and was offended by what felt to him like a misguided gesture. He returned her money and recommended that she join a local Black Lives Matter protest, call local representatives to complain about police brutality, and read works by writers such as Colson Whitehead, Toni Morrison and Ta-Nehisi Coates.
See if kind actions can substitute for words
Emillio Mesa, a San Francisco events planner, always harbored resentment that his mother had left him with his grandparents in the Dominican Republic for six years when he was a child. Though he joined her in New York, she never really explained what happened or apologized for leaving him. He kept his distance. Decades later, after he was beaten up in a robbery, he moved back into his mother’s house in the Bronx, in New York, where she took care of him for six months. He decided to allow the love she showed him as an adult to make up for her early absence and lack of explanation, and they were able to get close again.
Take it public
Kenan Trebincevic, a Muslim Bosnian war survivor, was dismayed that the Serbian government never issued an official apology for its genocide against his people during the Balkan War. Chronicling the atrocities he witnessed, he wrote the apology he felt he deserved and published it. A few Serbs his age contacted him to express their remorse. Becoming a spokesman for a younger generation of Bosnians was how he met his Sarajevan wife. By confronting people from his past, he found his future.
Express your forgiveness
Gary Weinstein, a Michigan jeweler, forgave the drunken driver who killed his wife and children, reading a statement aloud in court. When Weinstein arranged to meet him in prison, the driver expressed his deep remorse. That helped Weinstein move on. He became a spokesman for forgiveness, which was empowering.
Enlist a forgiveness surrogate
Rabbi Joseph Krakoff asked an estranged father to recite this prayer with his daughter on his deathbed: “You are forgiven. I forgive you. Please forgive me. I love you.” The father told his child, “I still don’t think I did anything wrong, but I’ll say the prayer because the rabbi says it’s a better way to leave the world.” Even the begrudging words helped her. Religious leaders or therapists may be able to intervene on your behalf.
Ask advice from mutual friends
In the case of my estrangement from my mentor, he was upset that I had let mutual acquaintances know what had happened, because it threatened his reputation. When he eventually wanted to get together to talk about it, I asked, “Are you doing this to make me shut up?” He said, “Yes! Shut up already!” half-jokingly — or maybe not. I didn’t necessarily care what his motives were — I wanted him to acknowledge he’d been wrong, which he did. Seeing the negative reactions of others in the community spurred him to wake up and reach out to discuss it.
Try to view the offense as a mystery
Drawing on the Hindu outlook he grew up with, Thakkar suggested searching for a larger view of your falling-out. He shared a metaphor: “A commuter was enraged when a woman in an SUV stopped abruptly to get something in the back seat, almost causing an accident. He didn’t know the driver’s infant was choking. Similarly, there is something you don’t know about your mentor’s life that will shed light on his insensitive actions.”
It turned out that something tragic had happened to my mentor’s family. “I’m so sorry. I had no idea,” I wound up telling him, apologizing profusely myself.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Dozens of people were arrested on Monday night in lower Manhattan as hundreds participated in a march on Martin Luther King Jr. Day organized by Black activist groups, according to the police and witnesses.
Videos posted online by witnesses and participants show New York Police Department officers with helmets, batons and zip ties trying to clear protesters who had gathered on the streets and sidewalks near City Hall. Some of the marchers went to the area after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge.
A spokesperson for the department said dozens of arrests were made between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the vicinity of Chambers and Centre streets. According to some videos posted online, the police began arresting people after urging the crowd to disperse.
The episode came in the late hours of Martin Luther King’s Birthday, and just days after the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, sued the New York Police Department over its handling of protests this summer after the death of George Floyd.
James is seeking to have a court-appointed monitor installed to oversee the department’s policing tactics at protests. If successful, this monitor would join another monitor appointed in 2013 to oversee how the city implements changes to its stop-and-frisk policy.
One witness to Monday night's events, Jordan Plaza of the Bronx, said a relatively small number of protesters had spilled off the sidewalks and into the street when the police announced that they were obstructing the road and would soon be arrested.
“They weren’t approaching the police in a violent manner,” Plaza, 20, said. “Police randomly surged.”
Plaza said she had stumbled upon the protest earlier in the night on the way to see friends and joined on a whim. She said she was startled by what she saw and contrasted the treatment of protesters in New York City with the treatment of those loyal to President Donald Trump who rioted inside the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago.
“It baffles me because the Capitol building, they were able to get in,” Plaza said. “Here, they were protesting outside a courthouse.” (The New York County Surrogate’s Court is on Centre Street, as is the Tweed Courthouse, which houses the New York City Department of Education.)
Hani Bello, a 27-year-old from Brooklyn, belongs to FreeBlackRadicals, one of several groups that she said responded to that evening’s “call to action” to protest.
After a gathering outside Barclays Center at 5 p.m. that featured speakers who frequently invoked Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Bello said she and others walked onto the Brooklyn Bridge, which bikers with the protest closed off to vehicular traffic. At one point, the group broke into ballroom dancing and vogueing.
Bello said it warmed her up and that she took off her gloves and scarf.
“It is a form of resilience, being on that bridge, taking it over,” Bello said. “To feel resilient is part of Black liberation.”
After the marchers crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, the police blocked the road leading from the bridge to City Hall Park, she said. “The park is for the public,” it was open for use, she said. “People have the right to voice their opinions on taxpayer-funded land.”
On Monday night, images of officers yanking individuals out of a crowd of protesters began circulating widely on social media, and echoed scenes from last summer, when Black Lives Matter demonstrators flooded the streets in New York and other cities. A number of those videos helped fuel the lawsuit by James, the state’s attorney general.
The lawsuit she filed in federal court in Manhattan is the first time that the state attorney general has sued a police department, according to James’ office.
“There was ample ability and opportunity for the city and NYPD leadership to make important changes to the way that officers interact with peaceful protesters, but time and time again they did not,” James said.

Full text: Letitia James says the police have used illegal and harmful tactics for years, and wants a federal monitor to oversee the department's tactics at future demonstrations.
The New York State attorney general sued the New York City Police Department on Thursday over what she said were widespread abuses in how officers handled the protests that erupted last summer after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The attorney general, Letitia James, wants a court-appointed monitor to oversee the department's policing tactics at future protests, and a court order to declare that the policies and practices the department used during the protests last May and June were unlawful.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, marked the first time in history that the state attorney general has sued a police department, according to Ms. James's office.
More than 2,000 demonstrators were arrested, most of them while protesting peacefully. An investigation by the attorney general's office found that police officers beat protesters with batons, rammed them with bicycles, used a dangerous containment strategy called kettling, and arrested legal observers and medics without proper justification.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who met with Ms. James on Wednesday, expressed disappointment in her decision to go to court to seek a monitor. He said the lawsuit would slow his administration's efforts to implement major changes -- a goal he said they shared.
"A court process and the added bureaucracy of a federal monitor will not speed up this work," he said in a statement on Thursday after the lawsuit was filed. "There is no time to waste and we will continue to press forward."
John Miller, the deputy police commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence, said the department welcomed changes. But he said the lawsuit does not show a "pattern and practice" required by federal law for a monitor to be appointed.
However, Ms. James said at a news conference on Thursday that officers' behavior at the protests demonstrated a pattern of illegal and harmful practices that the mayor and Police Department had failed to prevent through discipline, policies and training.
"There was ample ability and opportunity for the city and N.Y.P.D. leadership to make important changes to the way that officers interact with peaceful protesters, but time and time again, they did not," Ms. James said.
"They did not train, they did not supervise, they did not stop officers who engaged in this misconduct," she continued. "And they did not discipline them either. Instead, they failed the people of the City of New York."
Ms. James, the state's top prosecutor, has not brought charges against any of the officers involved in the protests, and neither have the police, local prosecutors nor the city Department of Investigation. She said her investigation, assigned by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, was a civil matter and that the problems with the police's handling of the protests go well beyond the acts of individual officers.
But the lawsuit is an extraordinary step. Attorneys general rarely leverage their powers against entire police departments, especially in places where the mayor who appoints the department's leaders belongs to the same political party. Mr. de Blasio and Ms. James are both Democrats, though the city's top two police officials, Commissioner Dermot Shea and Chief of Department Terence A. Monahan, have registered as Republicans.
Ms. James's complaint amounted to an admonishment of Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Shea and Chief Monahan, who are named in her lawsuit. She recalled at the news conference how Mr. Shea had said that his department had executed its protest plan "flawlessly," and the mayor had said the police's uses of kettling to contain protesters were "justified."
The mayor's office said on Thursday that he had never used the word "justified." Mr. de Blasio, in December, banned police from using the tactic.
Ms. James has called for control of the Police Department to be stripped from the mayor and given to an independent panel. She said her investigation had found "an egregious abuse of police power; rampant, excessive use of force; and leadership unable and willing to stop it."
Gideon Oliver, a civil rights lawyer who is representing several demonstrators who have filed lawsuits against the police, said the attorney general's lawsuit built on years of efforts by civil rights lawyers to address "the city's wildly inadequate responses to these problems that have been going on for a very long time."
Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, said the police response was a failure of the city's leadership.
"They sent cops out to police unprecedented protests and violent riots with no plan, no strategy and no support," he said. "They should be forced to answer for the resulting chaos, instead of pointing fingers at cops on the streets and ignoring the criminals who attacked us with bricks and firebombs."
If Ms. James is successful, a monitor would join another already keeping watch over how the city implements changes to its stop-and-frisk policy. In 2013, a federal judge appointed a monitor after finding that officers targeted and stopped Black and Hispanic people without sufficient legal reason in violation of their civil rights.
The city has paid large sums to settle lawsuits stemming from clashes between police and civilians, such as during Occupy Wall Street in 2011 and the Republican National Convention in 2004. But officers have rarely been disciplined for abuses, and policies have remained the same for decades. The lawsuit filed Thursday mentioned abuses at protests that continued through the November election.
This summer's incidents drew scrutiny and prompted several investigations into the department's tactics and the officers' behavior. In December, the city Department of Investigation said the Police Department's botched handling of the protests was emblematic of a systemic failure to recognize the First Amendment rights of protesters.
Mr. de Blasio has said that he looks "back with remorse" at the fraught first days of June last summer. "I'm sorry I didn't do better," he said after the report was released.
Andrew Smith, a protester, spoke at Ms. James's news conference about being attacked by an officer.
In a video that went viral, an officer snatched down Mr. Smith's face mask and pepper-sprayed him. The officer later bragged about what he did to other cops. Mr. Smith, who sued the Police Department, described the attorney general's lawsuit as historic and an "indictment against the largest police force in America for its culture of taking opportunities to target those that they are sworn to protect."
Passers-by who have tried to record officers' interactions with protesters and other people say they, too, have been attacked by the police.
Rayne Valentine works at a city hospital where his duties included moving bodies of people who had died of Covid-19 to refrigeration. During a walk home, he said he stopped to record six officers he saw beating another man.
After a brief exchange with one officer, he said, several of them attacked him. He had to return to the hospital that night because of a gash the attack left on his head. Doctors closed his wound with staples.
The Legal Aid Society, the city's largest public-defender group, and the New York Civil Liberties Union represent 11 people who have sued the city over the protests. The organizations said in a joint statement that they hoped the attorney general's lawsuit would be "the beginning of a serious reckoning over police violence and militarized use of force against protesters, especially people of color, and a check on the impunity many officers have come to see as their right."
Jumaane Williams, the city's public advocate, said that the lawsuit was not enough on its own to break the cycle of police abuse and public outcry. City and state leaders, he said, must acknowledge policing disparities and use their powers to redesign a public-safety model that is less reliant on officers.
Noting the current budget negotiations, he added: "What better time to do this and have this conversation, and frankly do the things that everybody knows we need to do? Because it's not even about as much conversation as it is about action."

NEW YORK — For more than a week, authorities in New York City have faced mounting public pressure to arrest a woman caught on video tackling a Black teenager in the lobby of a boutique hotel in SoHo after falsely accusing him of stealing her cellphone.
Now, detectives are traveling to California to interview the woman, police said Thursday — an unusual step often reserved for crimes that are violent or high profile.
It was not yet clear if that meant the woman, identified by her lawyer as Miya Ponsetto, 22, would face any charges in connection with the Dec. 26 incident. Police said the investigation was continuing, and prosecutors have declined to discuss the case, noting Thursday that charges have not been filed.
The episode was yet another instance of Black people being confronted with baseless accusations while going about their daily lives. It has drawn comparisons to an incident in May when a white woman called 911 to falsely claim that a Black bird-watcher in Central Park was threatening her life.
The video was taken and posted on social media by Keyon Harrold, a prominent jazz musician, who was staying at the Arlo hotel with his 14-year-old son, Keyon Harrold Jr.
In the video, Ponsetto can be seen confronting Harrold and his son after they walk into the hotel lobby, insisting without evidence that Keyon Jr. has her cellphone. Ponsetto can be seen asking a hotel manager to help her, after which the manager identifies himself and asks Keyon Jr. to produce a cellphone, in an apparent attempt to verify Ponsetto’s claim.
Surveillance footage released by police last week shows Ponsetto running after Keyon Jr. and tackling him. Ponsetto was trying to rummage through Keyon Jr.'s pockets, Harrold said.
Harrold said he was told by the hotel that an Uber driver found Ponsetto’s phone later in the day, and she picked it up from the hotel.
Ponsetto has been the subject of public scrutiny and speculation about possible criminal charges since the video emerged. According to public records, she faces unrelated criminal charges in California, including a lewd conduct charge in Los Angeles County involving an incident in February and a driving while intoxicated charge in Ventura County following an incident in October.
Prosecutors in California did not immediately provide more details.
In an interview Wednesday, Ponsetto’s lawyer, Sharen H. Ghatan, confirmed Ponsetto was the woman in the Arlo hotel video. She said Ponsetto regretted her actions and was seeking to apologize in person to Harrold and his family. As of Thursday morning, police had not contacted Ponsetto, Ghatan said.
Ghatan said Ponsetto was not targeting Harrold or his son because of their race. She is of Puerto Rican and Vietnamese descent and does not identify as white, Ghatan said.
“She’s not trying to make any racial statement,” Ghatan said. “She’s a female herself of mixed cultural descent. She’s not some blond-haired, blue-eyed privileged white lady. She literally just wanted to get her phone back.”
Ponsetto was visiting her father who lives in the New York City area over the holidays when she lost her cellphone, Ghatan said. Ponsetto was a guest at the hotel at some point during the holiday week, Ghatan said, but it was not clear why she was there when the confrontation took place.
Ponsetto saw Keyon Jr. with a phone and thought it was hers, according to Ghatan.
“What happened, happened,” Ghatan said. “Would she do it again? No. It was purely out of her being anxious, stressed, cornered, feeling helpless, lost, alone, unsupported.”
She said Ponsetto works in an office for a health-related company, but declined to be more specific.
“She’s not a celebrity, she’s not a Kardashian,” Ghatan said. “She doesn’t know how to act, she doesn’t know how to behave. She’s a young girl.”
Harrold said Ponsetto’s actions demanded more than an apology. He said that both her behavior and the hotel manager’s actions reflected a systemic problem where Black people — and Black teenagers in particular — are seen as threats or outsiders.
Harrold described his son as innocent and impressionable — “an aspiring music producer, drummer, artist, who loves being around his friends.” But, he said, he is too often not seen that way. “He’s made out to be criminal. He’s made out to be a threat. That’s the thing that needs to change.”
The Police Department has said that they were not treating the confrontation as a “bias incident.” But it has drawn widespread attention as a striking example of racial profiling.
Joseph L. Giacalone, a retired New York City police sergeant and an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that the pressure from the public on the Police Department “is just immense here,” particularly given the recent protests against systemic racism following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
He said that it was a rarity for detectives to travel across the country for anything other than murder or cold case investigations.
“This is an unusual event that is driven not only by media, but by social media,” he said.
At a news conference last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio said it has “almost become tragically comical how much you can rely on the fact that someone will unjustly accuse a young man of color in America.”
“When someone does something like this, they have to suffer consequences,” he said. “And there needs to be real action here by the criminal justice system to make sure there are consequences in this case.”
At a separate news conference, the Rev. Al Sharpton and civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump, who is representing Harrold, called on prosecutors and the police to bring charges.
“This has larger implications,” Crump said. “It was Emmett Till who was falsely accused and racially profiled that led to him being killed.”
Arlo, which has two hotels in the city, advertises its SoHo location as a trendy destination with a rooftop bar and Hudson River views.
The hotel has apologized to Harrold and his son in a statement. While the hotel said the manager called police to report the incident and hotel security had stepped in, “more could have been done to de-escalate the dispute.”
Harrold, who has performed with artists including Beyoncé, Rihanna and Jay-Z, said he had been staying at the Arlo since mid-December.

KENOSHA, Wis. — A prosecutor in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has declined to bring charges against Rusten Sheskey, the police officer who shot Jacob Blake outside an apartment building in August, an episode that sparked protests and rioting and made the city an instant flash point in a summer of unrest that began with the killing of George Floyd.
The decision was announced Tuesday by Michael Graveley, the Kenosha County district attorney, who said that investigators had reviewed 40 hours of video and hundreds of pages of police reports.
A lawyer for Blake’s family expressed “immense disappointment” in the announcement. “This decision failed not only Jacob and his family but the community that protested and demanded justice,” the lawyer, Ben Crump, wrote on Twitter.
Even before revealing his determination, Graveley pleaded with his community — and the country — to keep the peace.
“Rather than burning things down, can moments of tragedy like this be an opportunity to build things?” he asked.
The case involved a white officer shooting a Black man, circumstances that the prosecutor said made the decision especially difficult for him.
“I feel in many ways completely inadequate for this moment,” said Graveley, who is white. “I have never in my life had a moment where I’ve had to contend with explicit or implicit bias based on my race. I have never had a moment in my life where I’ve had to fear for my safety either with police officers or people in authority.”
He added that he also has not had experiences facing police officers, “knowing I could face armed persons who might try to end my life.”
Advocates for Blake, who is 29, have been awaiting the decision for months and holding regular demonstrations in Kenosha, calling upon Graveley to file charges against the officer.
The community simmered with tension before the announcement, as residents and officials anxiously sought to prevent the unrest that unfolded after the shooting last summer.
Many businesses in Kenosha were boarded up Tuesday in anticipation of the charging decision, and some streets were closed. National Guard members stood near the Kenosha County Courthouse, which was surrounded by an iron fence. At a Subway sandwich shop two blocks from the courthouse, fresh plywood was installed Tuesday, as it had been during the summer unrest. “If the decision goes in the cop’s favor, we’re thinking it’s going to turn how it was before,” an employee, Tyler Blazek, said.
The City Council unanimously passed an emergency declaration Monday that would allow the mayor to implement a curfew once the district attorney made his decision public.
The sheriff for Kenosha County also declared a state of emergency that he said would allow him to change the schedules of his deputies.
Sheskey, who has been employed by the Kenosha Police Department for seven years, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. His lawyer, Brendan Matthews, said in December that he remained on leave.
The shooting, on Aug. 23, unfolded after three officers arrived at an apartment complex in Kenosha in response to a domestic complaint.
As the officers attempted to take Blake into custody, he walked along the passenger side of a four-door SUV, away from the officers, as three of his children waited in the back seat of the vehicle. The officers used a Taser in an effort to subdue Blake, which was ineffective; Sheskey then grabbed Blake’s shirt and fired his gun several times into Blake’s back.
Two other officers were pointing their guns at Blake during the incident.
According to state officials, Blake admitted that he was in possession of a knife; a knife was later recovered from the floorboard of Blake’s car near the driver’s seat. There were no other weapons in the vehicle.
The shooting was captured on a cellphone video, which was shared widely, fueling protests and destruction in Kenosha.
The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the case.
Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, condemned the shooting in its immediate aftermath. “While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,” he said on Twitter.
For several days in August, protests and destruction erupted on the streets of Kenosha, as rioters burned buildings, cars and garbage trucks, smashed streetlamps and spray-painted graffiti on schools and businesses. Hundreds of National Guardsmen were summoned to Kenosha in an attempt to restore order, using tear gas and rubber bullets to subdue protesters.
Two days after the shooting of Blake, Kyle Rittenhouse, who was then 17, shot and killed two men on a downtown street in what his lawyer has described as an act of self-defense. He was charged with six criminal counts, including first-degree intentional homicide.
On Tuesday, Rittenhouse, now 18, pleaded not guilty to the charges during a brief arraignment that was done via videoconference. His case is scheduled to proceed in March.
Outside the courthouse on Tuesday afternoon, two protesters said they were there to support Rittenhouse.
“I’m here to support Kyle. Self -defense is not a crime,” said Tim Conrad, 34, who drove 90 minutes from Joliet, Illinois, to be in Kenosha.
His friend, Emily Cahill, 32, from Plainfield, Illinois, carried a poster that read “IGY6 Kyle” meaning “I got your back, Kyle,” she said.
John Antaramian, the mayor of Kenosha, and Daniel Miskinis, the city’s police chief, wrote an op-ed in the Kenosha News in December vowing that they would not allow destruction of businesses to be repeated after Graveley’s announcement.
“Whether you agree or disagree, we ask that you express your opinions peacefully and lawfully,” they wrote. “We will not — we cannot — tolerate the kind of violence we saw on our streets earlier this year and we will take definitive steps to protect our residents and businesses.”
The state Department of Justice and its Division of Criminal Investigation led the investigation into the shooting of Blake. On Sept. 21, Attorney General Josh Kaul of Wisconsin announced that the state would be bringing in an outside consultant, Noble Wray, a former police chief, to conduct an independent review of the case.
Blake was partially paralyzed after the shooting, which severed his spinal cord; his family said he was unlikely to ever walk again.
At the time of the shooting, Blake was facing charges stemming from a July incident. On Nov. 6, prosecutors in Kenosha County Circuit Court dropped one count of third-degree sexual assault and agreed to drop one count of criminal trespass if Blake pleaded guilty to two counts of disorderly conduct, according to court records and Blake’s lawyer, Patrick Cafferty.
Blake, who made a court appearance via Zoom from a rehabilitation center in Illinois where he was receiving treatment for his spinal cord injuries, pleaded guilty to the two disorderly conduct charges and was sentenced to two years of probation.
The Walworth County district attorney, Zeke Wiedenfeld, who had prosecuted the case, said the sexual assault charge had been dropped in part because the woman who had accused Blake declined to cooperate with the prosecutors. Blake had maintained that he did not commit sexual assault.
