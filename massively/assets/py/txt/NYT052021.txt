In 2018, Liz O’Sullivan and her colleagues at a prominent artificial intelligence startup began work on a system that could automatically remove nudity and other explicit images from the internet.
They sent millions of online photos to workers in India, who spent weeks adding tags to explicit material. The data paired with the photos would be used to teach AI software how to recognize indecent images. But once the photos were tagged, O’Sullivan and her team noticed a problem: The Indian workers had classified all images of same-sex couples as indecent.
For O’Sullivan, the moment showed how easily — and often — bias could creep into artificial intelligence. It was a “cruel game of Whac-a-Mole,” she said.
This month, O’Sullivan, a 36-year-old New Yorker, was named CEO of a new company, Parity. The startup is one of many organizations, including more than a dozen startups and some of the biggest names in tech, offering tools and services designed to identify and remove bias from AI systems.
Soon, businesses may need that help. In April, the Federal Trade Commission warned against the sale of AI systems that were racially biased or could prevent individuals from receiving employment, housing, insurance or other benefits. A week later, the European Union unveiled draft regulations that could punish companies for offering such technology.
It is unclear how regulators might police bias. This past week, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a government research lab whose work often informs policy, released a proposal detailing how businesses can fight bias in AI, including changes in the way technology is conceived and built.
Many in the tech industry believe businesses must start preparing for a crackdown. “Some sort of legislation or regulation is inevitable,” said Christian Troncoso, senior director of legal policy for the Software Alliance, a trade group that represents some of the biggest and oldest software companies. “Every time there is one of these terrible stories about AI, it chips away at public trust and faith.”
Over the past several years, studies have shown that facial recognition services, health care systems and even talking digital assistants can be biased against women, people of color and other marginalized groups. Amid a growing chorus of complaints over the issue, some local regulators have already taken action.
In late 2019, state regulators in New York opened an investigation of UnitedHealth Group after a study found that an algorithm used by a hospital prioritized care for white patients over Black patients, even when the white patients were healthier. Last year, the state investigated the Apple Card credit service after claims it was discriminating against women. Regulators ruled that Goldman Sachs, which operated the card, did not discriminate, while the status of the UnitedHealth investigation is unclear.
A spokesperson for UnitedHealth, Tyler Mason, said the company’s algorithm had been misused by one of its partners and was not racially biased. Apple declined to comment.
More than $100 million has been invested over the past six months in companies exploring ethical issues involving artificial intelligence, after $186 million last year, according to PitchBook, a research firm that tracks financial activity.
But efforts to address the problem reached a tipping point recently when the Software Alliance offered a detailed framework for fighting bias in AI, including the recognition that some automated technologies require regular oversight from humans. The trade group believes the document can help companies change their behavior and can show regulators and lawmakers how to control the problem.
Although they have been criticized for bias in their own systems, Amazon, IBM, Google and Microsoft also offer tools for fighting it.
O’Sullivan said there was no simple solution to bias in AI. A thornier issue is that some in the industry question whether the problem is as widespread or as harmful as she believes it is.
“Changing mentalities does not happen overnight — and that is even more true when you’re talking about large companies,” she said. “You are trying to change not just one person’s mind but many minds.”
When she started advising businesses on AI bias more than two years ago, O’Sullivan was often met with skepticism. Many executives and engineers espoused what they called “fairness through unawareness,” arguing that the best way to build equitable technology was to ignore issues like race and gender.
Increasingly, companies were building systems that learned tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, including photos, sounds, text and stats. The belief was that if a system learned from as much data as possible, fairness would follow.
But as O’Sullivan saw after the tagging done in India, bias can creep into a system when designers choose the wrong data or sort through it in the wrong way. Studies show that face-recognition services can be biased against women and people of color when they are trained on photo collections dominated by white men.
Designers can be blind to these problems. The workers in India — where gay relationships were still illegal at the time and where attitudes toward gays and lesbians were very different from those in the United States — were classifying the photos as they saw fit.
O’Sullivan saw the flaws and pitfalls of artificial intelligence while working for Clarifai, the company that ran the tagging project. She said she had left the company after realizing it was building systems for the military that she believed could eventually be used to kill. Clarifai did not respond to a request for comment.
She now believes that after years of public complaints over bias in AI — not to mention the threat of regulation — attitudes are changing. In its new framework for curbing harmful bias, the Software Alliance warned against fairness through unawareness, saying the argument did not hold up.
“They are acknowledging that you need to turn over the rocks and see what is underneath,” O’Sullivan said.
Still, there is resistance. She said a recent clash at Google, where two ethics researchers were pushed out, was indicative of the situation at many companies. Efforts to fight bias often clash with corporate culture and the unceasing push to build new technology, get it out the door and start making money.
It is also still difficult to know just how serious the problem is. “We have very little data needed to model the broader societal safety issues with these systems, including bias,” said Jack Clark, one of the authors of the AI Index, an effort to track AI technology and policy across the globe. “Many of the things that the average person cares about — such as fairness — are not yet being measured in a disciplined or a large-scale way.”
O’Sullivan, a philosophy major in college and a member of the American Civil Liberties Union, is building her company around a tool designed by Rumman Chowdhury, a well-known AI ethics researcher who spent years at the business consultancy Accenture before joining Twitter.
While other startups, like Fiddler AI and Weights and Biases, offer tools for monitoring AI services and identifying potentially biased behavior, Parity’s technology aims to analyze the data, technologies and methods a business uses to build its services and then pinpoint areas of risk and suggest changes.
The tool uses artificial intelligence technology that can be biased in its own right, showing the double-edged nature of AI — and the difficulty of O’Sullivan’s task.
Tools that can identify bias in AI are imperfect, just as AI is imperfect. But the power of such a tool, she said, is to pinpoint potential problems — to get people looking closely at the issue.
Ultimately, she explained, the goal is to create a wider dialogue among people with a broad range of views. The trouble comes when the problem is ignored — or when those discussing the issues carry the same point of view.
“You need diverse perspectives. But can you get truly diverse perspectives at one company?” O’Sullivan asked. “It is a very important question I am not sure I can answer.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — When the St. James Theater shut down with the rest of Broadway on March 12, 2020, the show playing there, aptly enough, was “Frozen.”
But 471 days later, the show that just reopened the theater — and Broadway more generally — is a totally different beast. Call “Springsteen on Broadway,” the singer-songwriter’s memoir-concert-ghost story, “Unfrozen,” because what’s playing now is an almost geological transformation of the relentlessly austere work that audiences experienced during its acclaimed run from October, 2017 to December, 2018.
Jesse Green, the chief theater critic, and Lindsay Zoladz, a pop music critic, saw the show on Tuesday night and reconvened on Wednesday to discuss, among many other things, the way changes of scale — and context — remake a rock artist, even in the theater. These are edited excerpts from their conversation.
JESSE GREEN: “Springsteen on Broadway” first played the 939-seat Walter Kerr Theater. Now it’s in a theater with nearly double the capacity. To me, the new version couldn’t be more different from the old one. What about you, Lindsay? I presume you’ve seen Springsteen in venues that accommodate thousands.
LINDSAY ZOLADZ : The previous two times I’ve seen Bruce were at Madison Square Garden and an open-air festival in Denmark, but this show still felt remarkably intimate to me. One of the most interesting aspects of the performance was the way it felt like a Broadway production constantly teetering on the edge of becoming a full-on rock concert. For the most part, I think it stayed firmly in the latter category, thanks mostly to Springsteen’s incredible command of the crowd — in thwarting their instincts to sing, shout requests or indulge in other arena-etiquette, he plays the audience like another instrument. But the more the show progressed, and especially when Springsteen brought out his wife, Patti Scialfa, for a pair of fiery duets, the more the atmosphere started to feel like something I haven’t had the chance to experience in over a year: a good, old-fashioned rock show. Jesse, did this feel more like a concert than what you’re used to reviewing? And as someone who saw the initial run in 2017 (I missed it on Broadway but caught it on Netflix), did this performance feel different?
GREEN : On paper, or at least on the set list, the 2017 show and the 2021 show are nearly identical. Only three of the 15 songs have changed. With Scialfa last night, he performed “Tougher Than the Rest” as before but, instead of “Brilliant Disguise,” followed it with the much less theatrical and more traditionally sexed-up “Fire.” He replaced “Long Walk Home” with “American Skin (41 Shots),” written about the killing of Amadou Diallo in 1999 but here a pointed reference to George Floyd and the many other Black people more recently killed by police officers. And he closed with “I’ll See You in My Dreams,” a quiet, doleful song, instead of the barnburner “Born to Run.” These changes (it’s also 30 minutes longer) made it feel more like a concert to me because it is more varied and topical, acknowledging — as he also did in his rewritten narration — the 15 months we’ve just been through. I’m curious about how his demeanor, which is notably different now, compares with what you’ve seen in larger, more explicitly rock venues.
ZOLADZ : I definitely noticed that his stage persona and his interactions with the audience felt different than a traditional Springsteen show — a little more irreverent, a little less focused on performing gratitude and thanks-for-coming-out-tonight earnestness at all costs. He opens with a tongue-in-cheek riff about how he’s revealing to us his rock-star “image”: “I haven’t done it yet,” he responds to the requisite applause, then waits a comic beat: “ That’s it.” It seemed like that initial wink freed him up to embody this theatrical character of “Bruce Springsteen,” a slightly different construct than the hard-charging bandleader he’s playing in concert. But the fact that he’s able to calibrate so effectively between these different stage-selves shows what an expert’s grasp he has on his own stage presence.
GREEN : Is “stage presence” the same in a theater as in an arena?
ZOLADZ : One important difference in the grammar of a rock concert versus a Broadway show: Rock-concert banter is often expected to give at least the illusion of spontaneity (even if a lot of arena shows are just as meticulously staged and rehearsed as any play). Audiences want to feel like something special is happening in their city, on that particular night — there’s no greater concert faux pas than greeting a St. Louis crowd, “Hello, Cleveland!” “Springsteen on Broadway” has obviously been worked and reworked to hit the same beats each evening on the same stage, but through the charismatic kineticism of his performance Springsteen is able to enliven it with an energy that effectively keeps it from feeling canned.
GREEN : He reads much of the script — which is already a gloss on “Born to Run,” his 2016 autobiography — from quite visible monitors, yet he is surprisingly adept at the illusion you mention: He plays himself, or a series of selves, with great confidence and skill. When he said he doesn’t understand himself even after 40 years of analysis, he sounded almost like a borscht belt tummler. This joke, true as it may be, would not have fit into the bleak cosmology of the original run, which left me stunned and often in tears; in that version Springsteen seemed to go to great pains to strip away all ingratiation in favor of the dark poetry of his story. Keep in mind that he was performing in the aftermath of the election of Donald Trump; he seemed to use that moment as a warning. Now, after 15 months of lockdown and worse, he offers much more comedy amid the severity: He does voices, impersonations and even, at the end, some crowd work. He affects a soothing familiarity, an almost Bidenesque folksiness. (I don’t believe it for a second, but it’s effective.) If his aim, as he says, is to be of “service” to society through his music, the show is his judgment about how that might best be done right now. I enjoyed it as much as the first time, and I found its shift in emphasis — its message that we may live with our ghosts and even draw joy from them — timely and moving; yet the earlier incarnation was, for me, more profound.
ZOLADZ : So much of the show is about the power of memory, surviving and bearing witness. One of the most affecting segments is still that bluesy, hollered deconstruction of “Born in the USA,” during which Springsteen pays tribute to two young men who never got to grow old, veterans of his local Jersey Shore rock circuit who were killed in Vietnam. “Springsteen on Broadway” was already a show thoroughly haunted by loss (of his father, his bandmate Clarence Clemons, and his mother’s slow deterioration because of Alzheimer’s), so he didn’t have to change much for its tone to meet this particular American moment. Right now, we’re all coming out of hiding, trying to square our gratitude at surviving with the heavy weight of loss we’ve witnessed. Springsteen is certainly up to the challenge of providing that kind of catharsis, and of reminding survivors their responsibility to honor and eulogize the dead — that is, of course, what “Born in the USA” is all about. In the end, as he recited an “Our Father” in his own idiosyncratic cadence, the show felt not so much like a theatrical performance or a concert as a religious sermon — I certainly heard more than one “Amen.”
GREEN : That was a new turn in this iteration. Early on he refers to being “duped” by the church as a child, and basically threatened into a lifelong submission to an unloving institution, yet after taking us through all the terrible contradictions of his childhood in the central New Jersey town of Freehold — that two-syllable oxymoron — and the more rewarding ones of a life in rock, he offers, at 71, in the church’s own words, what can only be called a benediction. I’m not even Roman Catholic and I felt forgiven for my trespasses.
ZOLADZ : You mentioned earlier the change in the closing number: Instead of “Born to Run,” it’s “I’ll See You in My Dreams,” from his most recent record. He still opens with the wide-eyed “Growing Up,” the second track off his 1973 debut album. And while the set list doesn’t run exactly chronologically, this change underscores the fact that we’re watching not only a character’s coming-of-age, but the long evolution of a songwriter learning how to chronicle his inner experience and the world around him. The show’s bare-bones arrangements allow him to crack these songs open and find new riches inside even the most familiar tunes. I must have heard “Thunder Road” a thousand times in my life — at the risk of sounding basic, it’s probably my favorite Bruce song — but I don’t think it’s ever moved me quite as deeply as it did last night, hearing such a stripped-down rendition that focused on the wistfulness of its lyricism.
GREEN : Cracking open his songs, he’s cracking open himself, and in the process showing us how many lives we each contain. I thought of that when entering the St. James, where anti-vaccination protesters have been demonstrating against the theater’s requirement that all audience members be completely immunized. The protesters might be happy to know that almost no one inside wore a mask — except, in a way, Springsteen, whose mask, if it ever comes off, merely reveals another and another.

The Elaine massacre of 1919 is believed to be the deadliest episode of racial violence in Arkansas history. But when historian Brian Mitchell began researching it a few years ago, he met teachers in the state who didn’t know about it or weren’t sure how to explain it to their students.
“Teachers who were having a difficult time talking about difficult histories didn’t know where to start,” he said.
So Mitchell, professor and expert on African American history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, helped create a virtual exhibit about the massacre and packed it with teaching materials.
After the murder of George Floyd last year triggered widespread protests and calls for racial justice, there has been more public discussion of America’s history of racial violence. The recent centennial of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which prompted President Joe Biden to visit the city, is a prominent example.
But the Tulsa race massacre isn’t the only one getting a fresh look. In some American schools, museums and other institutions, events like Elaine are being discussed for the first time. And some of these efforts are gaining momentum even as Republican politicians in several states try to block curriculums that emphasize systemic racism.
Roger Brooks, president of Facing History and Ourselves, an educational nonprofit based in Massachusetts, said it was thrilling to see “ the examination of untold or forgotten histories gaining traction across the country.”
“These types of projects, when approached with integrity and deep scholarship, provide a path toward filling out the contours of the larger contemporary picture of the times we’re living in,” he said.
An Arkansas tragedy
The massacre in Elaine, which sits on a bend of the Mississippi River about 100 miles south of Memphis, occurred after a group of Black sharecroppers informed plantation owners that they had formed a chapter of a national union.
As the farmers met at a local church, police officers interrupted them, leading to a shootout in which one of the officers was killed. A mob of white men then “poured into the county to suppress the alleged Black revolt that had been reported to them,” Mitchell wrote in a recent essay. Hundreds of U.S. Army soldiers were sent to Elaine at the governor’s request.
Over the next few days, soldiers, police officers and white mobs are believed to have killed hundreds of people. Homes were burned with Black families inside, and the victims included men, women and children, according to Nan Elizabeth Woodruff, professor emerita of African American studies at Pennsylvania State University.
A jury later convicted 12 Black men for the murders of three white men in Elaine. They were sentenced to death, but freed years later after six of the convictions were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1923.
Textbooks in Arkansas once “basically accepted” initial, pro-establishment accounts of the massacre from local officials and newspapers, said Barclay Key, historian at the University of Arkansas. More recent textbooks, he added, have better explained the role of Black union organizers and how the massacre started.
‘This happened in my community’
When Mitchell and his students began researching the Elaine massacre a few years ago, there was virtually no record of Black deaths from it in the county where it had occurred, he said. They managed to find death certificates in a local funeral home’s collection that confirmed deaths that had gone unreported at the time.
The class created a searchable index of those records and donated it to the Arkansas State Archive. Separately, Mitchell helped to create a virtual exhibit around the massacre’s centennial for the university’s Center for Arkansas History and Culture that includes teaching guides, archival records and interactive maps.
Hundreds of local teachers have incorporated materials from the exhibit into their lesson plans, said Deborah Baldwin, the university’s associate provost of collections and archives.
One of them, Ruth Brown, said she had taught the massacre to middle and high school students over the past decade, initially relying on materials and speakers from the Elaine Legacy Center, a local project to commemorate the massacre’s victims.
Over the past year, Brown used resources from the virtual exhibit and taught about the massacre as part of a broader curriculum that focused on literacy.
“The reason I get a good response is because they take ownership,” Brown, a social studies teacher in the Marvell-Elaine School District, said of her students. “You know, ‘This happened in my community.’”
From Florida to North Carolina
Elaine isn’t the only place in the American South where teachers, historians, curators and others are trying to educate communities about race massacres, often in places where such events are not a major focus of public school curriculums.
In Florida, the Orange County Library System’s website has a page about the 1920 Ocoee massacre — in which a white mob burned Black homes and churches — with links to books, films and other materials.
In Louisiana, the Historic New Orleans Collection published a website this year about Black activists during Reconstruction, the period immediately after the Civil War. One page analyzes the Mechanics’ Institute massacre of 1866, in which a white mob killed dozens of people attending a state constitutional convention that had been called to consider giving Black people the right to vote.
And last year in North Carolina, a museum published an interactive map about a massacre that coincided with the 1898 overthrow of a Black-majority city’s multiracial government.
That massacre by white militias in Wilmington, North Carolina, which left at least 60 Black people dead, began with efforts by local Democrats to block people from voting. A mob burned the office of a Black newspaper and sent Black workers fleeing into nearby swamps. White supremacists also forced elected Black officials to resign and banished other Black people from Wilmington.
A “story map” about the event, published last year by Cape Fear Museum of History and Science, offers a fresh account of what happened in Wilmington — and calls it not a “riot” but a “white supremacist massacre and a coup d’état.”
“The story map was conceived of before both the pandemic and the racial protests of 2020,” said Jan Davidson, the museum’s historian. “Still, it became a particularly relevant and timely intervention into the public conversation about race and power.”
Efforts to teach students and the public about race massacre have critics: Several Republican-led state legislatures have either passed or proposed measures that would limit how schools teach about racism.
Those efforts will make it harder for many teachers and school districts to introduce a “serious curriculum” around topics like slavery, freedom struggles and the legacies of white supremacy, said Woodruff.
Young people today are “more willing to question the past” than their parents were, she said, and demands for reckonings over the legacies of slavery and segregation — as well as the genocide of Native Americans and underreported state violence against Mexican Americans and Asian Americans — may grow as the United States moves from a white to a nonwhite majority.
“But we are not yet there,” she added.
Family history
In Arkansas, the push to talk more about the Elaine massacre comes not only from historians and teachers, but descendants of the victims.
One of them, James White Sr., directs programs at the Elaine Legacy Center. This summer he is helping to organize a reading program for about 50 children that will focus on writer Richard Wright, who lived in Elaine as a child. Wright’s 1945 memoir, “Black Boy,” tells the story of how his uncle was lynched there three years before the 1919 massacre.
One of Brown’s former students, Edlun Marshall, said that he grew up hearing about the massacre from his extended family. Teachers mentioned it in passing, he added, but he did not learn the full story until he took Brown’s class in high school.
“I can definitely remember feeling the sadness,” he said, “and also the rage, to hear that innocent people were brutally attacked and killed for simply trying to have some type of equality in this land of opportunity.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The choreographers Robert Battle and Angie Pittman had just met formally for the first time when they were left to talk one on one, in front of a live (virtual) audience, during a recent episode of the conversation series Black Dance Stories.
“I’m going to sit back and watch you two get in trouble,” Charmaine Warren, the show’s warm and energizing host, said as she raised a glass of wine and took a sip. “I’ll see you in a minute. Have fun!” And she slipped off-screen.
As it turned out, they had plenty to talk about. Battle, 48, artistic director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, had grown up steeped in gospel music through his family and church. Pittman, 31, an experimental choreographer, also grew up with church as a strong influence; her background as a liturgical praise dancer shapes her work today. By the end of their 10 minutes together, they had broken into song, an impromptu version of the hymn “Blessed Assurance.”
It was a typically serendipitous edition of Black Dance Stories, full of unexpected connections, unearthed through storytelling. Like so many virtual events that emerged during the coronavirus pandemic, the weekly series, which began in June 2020, started with a few people, a Zoom account and the need for community in a time of isolation. But over the past year, it has evolved into much more: a lively gathering place, a Thursday-night ritual and, most enduringly, an extensive collection of the histories of Black dance artists, as told by those artists themselves.
On Thursday at 6 p.m. Eastern, the show, which streams live on YouTube, will conclude its second season and bring its current incarnation to a close. The decision to wind it down, Warren said, came with the return of live performance; people have started going out more often, not as bound to their homes or computer screens.
But Warren, who produces the program with a tight-knit team she calls the “the BDS family,” stresses that in some ways, Black Dance Stories isn’t going anywhere: The nearly 50 episodes, featuring more than 90 guests across generations and genres of dance, will remain online, a free resource for anyone wanting to learn or teach about the work and lives of Black dance artists.
“The biggest thing we have built is an impressive archive,” Warren, 60, said in a phone interview from her home in Montclair, New Jersey. “That’s a good thing we’re walking away with.”
In addition to keeping the archive on YouTube, she hopes to find a Black-led institution to house it in a more official capacity. She is also dreaming up the show’s next chapter (still in a planning phase): an in-person version, with guests from the online series moving together onstage.
“No more talking,” she said. “Let’s dance! We miss it.”
A curator, performer, dance historian and writer, Warren — known affectionately to many as Mama Charmaine — began envisioning Black Dance Stories in the early days of the pandemic, when so many in the dance world were stuck at home with no work, their usual routines and social circles fractured. The murder of George Floyd, she said, heightened her desire to bring Black dance artists together to share their stories.
“When George Floyd was murdered, I was so empty,” she said. “My heart was hurt. And that’s when I felt even more of an urge to do something for our community.” As depleting as that moment was, she added, “I also wanted to find some kind of a salve, and that salve is community.”
The show’s clear but open-ended structure allows for both solo storytelling and intimate dialogue. Most episodes pair two guests, each of whom is invited to speak, to tell any story, for 20 minutes; in between, they overlap in conversation. They might already be well-acquainted or, as with Battle and Pittman, just getting to know each other. The pairings, Warren said, were based primarily on when guests were available, which led to some surprising matches.
“Introducing people is so much a part of her spirit,” said Battle, who has known Warren for over a decade, “this notion that, ‘Oh, you two need to know each other,’ and then stepping back to give space for whatever needs to come out of that.”
“It only works because of her,” Pittman said, reflecting on the uncertain moments when guests are dropped into conversation. “She has an incredibly supportive way of being that lends itself so well to a show like this. It’s fueled by her excitement about the people.”
While Warren offers occasional prompts — and shout-outs to and from the audience, who can participate via live chat — she is not so much an interviewer as she is an encouraging listener, staying mostly offscreen.
“It keeps the focus on the artists,” said choreographer and dance educator Kimani Fowlin, managing director of the series. “We really want it to be about their story.”
The writer Eva Yaa Asantewaa, a senior curatorial director at the dance organization Gibney, said that the show is not only “a lot of fun” but that it also does the vital work of allowing Black artists to speak for themselves, “as opposed to being talked about and defined by other people.”
“Our need to document what we do as Black creatives in this society is always an issue,” Yaa Asantewaa said, “because so much information is lost or distorted, or other people take credit for things. So to be able to connect with artists who are telling their own stories in their own way and dialoguing with one another about their lives is invaluable” — and not only now, “but also down the line, for future artists and future fans of dance.”
“What Charmaine has done is historic,” she added. “It should be preserved and honored.”
From its beginnings with a team of four people and no funding aside from individual donations, the program has grown considerably in the past year, while maintaining the living-room-party atmosphere that Warren set out to create. A partnership with the Brooklyn organization 651Arts, announced in January, provided a financial boost. The team behind the series has more than doubled in size, and their work has made its way into college dance curricula. In August, episodes began including American Sign Language interpretation for wider accessibility.
Sydnie L. Mosley, founder of the Harlem-based collective SLMDances and a dance educator, said that the Black Dance Stories archive has great potential as an educational resource.
“It’s filling the gaps of a lot of things that we did not learn in our dance history classes,” said Mosley, who appeared on the show last summer with the choreographer Raja Feather Kelly. “We get to have access to more people and their practices than if we were waiting for their work to be reviewed, or waiting for an academic to write an article about them.”
The stories that fill the archive are often deeply personal. When members of the Black Dance Stories team introduce themselves at the top of each episode, they say a few words about their ancestry, underscoring, as Warren says, that “we didn’t get here alone.” Guests tend to follow their lead, discussing both their family and artistic lineages.
For the last month of the series, Warren has been honoring her own dance lineage by featuring founding members of the International Association of Blacks in Dance and influential arts presenters. The final episode will bring together one of those founders, Joan Myers Brown, and Mikki Shepard, original producer of DanceAfrica, an annual festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that began in 1977 and that Warren now produces.
“I stand on the shoulders of these Black powerful women,” Warren said. “We would not be here without them.”
The show’s pairings continue to have ripple effects. Kelly and Mosley, who knew each other before their episode, both said the experience had strengthened their professional relationship. “Now we have this connection that’s like, ‘Hey, I’m going to look out for you and your artistic interests,’” Kelly said. “And she’s doing the same for me.”
And while Battle declined to give details just yet, he said that a project of some kind is in the works for him and Pittman. “Whatever it will be,” he said, “it will definitely be a result of this connection through Black Dance Stories.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Supreme Court Acts in Cases on Transgender Rights and Excessive Force

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a transgender youth’s victory in a case on access to high school bathrooms and revived a lawsuit from the parents of a man who had died in police custody.
Both moves drew opposition from some of the court’s most conservative members. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have heard the transgender case, and they, along with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, said the court had bowed to fear of public criticism in the case on police violence.
The court’s default mode this term has often appeared to be caution, frustrating conservatives on and off the court who had hoped its six-justice majority of Republican appointees would act more boldly.
The case on transgender rights appeared to close the book on a long-running lawsuit that started in 2015, when Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy who was a student at Gloucester High School in southeastern Virginia, sued the local school board over a policy that required students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms for their “corresponding biological genders.”
A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last year that the school board’s policy violated the Constitution and a federal law.
“The proudest moments of the federal judiciary have been when we affirm the burgeoning values of our bright youth, rather than preserve the prejudices of the past,” Judge Henry F. Floyd wrote for the majority. “How shallow a promise of equal protection that would not protect Grimm from the fantastical fears and unfounded prejudices of his adult community.”
The Supreme Court had agreed to hear an earlier appeal in the case but dismissed it in 2017 after the Trump administration changed the federal government’s position on transgender rights. The Biden administration has since adopted policies protecting transgender students.
Last year, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of transgender rights for the first time, saying that a federal employment discrimination law applied to LGBT workers. But Gorsuch, writing for the majority in that case, said the ruling did not address access to restrooms.
“We do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms or anything else of the kind,” he wrote.
Grimm welcomed the Supreme Court’s rejection of the school board’s appeal in the case, Gloucester County School Board v. Grimm, No. 20-1163.
“I am glad that my yearslong fight to have my school see me for who I am is over,” he said. “Being forced to use the nurse’s room, a private bathroom and the girls’ room was humiliating for me, and having to go to out-of-the-way bathrooms severely interfered with my education. Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials.”
As is the Supreme Court’s practice, it gave no reasons for declining to hear the school board’s appeal.
In the excessive force case, Lombardo v. St. Louis, No. 20-391, the justices ordered an appeals court to take another look at a ruling in favor of police officers accused of suffocating a man by pressing on his back while he was facedown on the ground. In their petition seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for the man’s family said the incident was reminiscent of the murder of George Floyd, the Black man whose death in Minneapolis police custody helped set off last summer’s racial justice protests.
The case started when police officers in St. Louis arrested Nicholas Gilbert, a 27-year-old homeless man, for trespassing in a condemned building and failing to appear in court for a traffic ticket. They brought him to a holding cell in a police station. Later, responding to an apparent suicide attempt, officers handcuffed and shackled Gilbert.
“Three officers held Gilbert’s limbs down at the shoulders, biceps and legs,” the Supreme Court’s unsigned opinion said. “At least one other placed pressure on Gilbert’s back and torso. Gilbert tried to raise his chest, saying: ‘It hurts. Stop.’ ”
After 15 minutes of struggling, Gilbert’s breathing became abnormal. “The officers rolled Gilbert onto his side and then his back to check for a pulse,” the opinion said. “Finding none, they performed chest compressions and rescue breathing. An ambulance eventually transported Gilbert to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.”
Gilbert’s parents sued, losing in the federal appeals court in St. Louis, which ruled that the officers had not used unconstitutionally excessive force.
The Supreme Court said the appeals court may not have taken account of all of the relevant evidence.
“It is unclear whether the court thought the use of a prone restraint — no matter the kind, intensity, duration or surrounding circumstances — is per se constitutional so long as an individual appears to resist officers’ efforts to subdue him,” the Supreme Court’s opinion said, returning the case to the appeals court to give it “the opportunity to employ an inquiry that clearly attends to the facts and circumstances.”
In dissent, Alito, joined by Thomas and Gorsuch, said the Supreme Court had chosen the worst of the three available options in the case. It should have, Alito wrote, either denied review or agreed to hear and decide the case itself.
“The court, unfortunately, is unwilling to face up to the choice between denying the petition (and bearing the criticism that would inevitably elicit) and granting plenary review (and doing the work that would entail),” Alito wrote. “I favor the latter course, but what we should not do is take the easy out that the court has chosen.”
In a third opinion Monday, Thomas, writing only for himself in connection with the court’s denial of review in a tax case involving a Colorado marijuana dispensary, said that the court’s 2005 decision upholding congressional power to prohibit local cultivation and use of marijuana warrants reconsideration. Thomas had dissented from that decision, Gonzales v. Raich.
“Once comprehensive, the federal government’s current approach is a half-in, half-out regime that simultaneously tolerates and forbids local use of marijuana,” he wrote in the new case, Standing Akimbo v. United States, No. 20-645. “This contradictory and unstable state of affairs strains basic principles of federalism and conceals traps for the unwary.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

GENEVA — The United Nations human rights chief on Monday urged nations to take action to root out systemic racism against people of African descent, as she released a report calling for measures to dismantle discrimination and for sweeping changes to policing, as well as reparations.
“The status quo is untenable,” Michelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. “Systemic racism needs a systemic response. There is today a momentous opportunity to achieve a turning point for racial equality and justice.”
The 20-page report and an accompanying 95-page conference paper draw on evidence form 60 countries. Work on them started after the May 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minnesota by a white police officer. Its release comes days after the officer, Derek Chauvin, was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison.
“We could not find a single example of a state that has fully reckoned with the past or comprehensively accounted for the impacts on the lives of people of African descent today,” said Mona Rishmawi, who supervised the preparation of the report.
The U.N. human rights office, which prepared the report, recommends creation of a commission or some other body with a one- or two-year mandate to scrutinize and monitor law enforcement.
It urges a reimagining of policing to address racial stereotyping, the militarization of weapons and tactics, and a lack of accountability.
The report draws on interviews with more than 340 people and more than 100 written submissions from civil society and academic organizations. It points to common patterns of experience for people of African descent in Europe, Latin America and North America contending with poverty and with barriers to education, health care, jobs and political participation.
The report spotlights the deaths of 190 people of African descent who died at the hands of law-enforcement officers, most of them in the United States, pointing out that few of the victims posed a threat.
It analyzes seven emblematic cases, including those involving Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the United States, together with cases from Brazil, Britain, Colombia and France. Only the death of Floyd has resulted in police being held to account.
But the deaths recorded in the preparation of this report were just “the tip of the iceberg,” Rishmawi noted. She cited a mother in Latin America who protested that “you always talk about George Floyd, every day we have a George Floyd and nobody talks about it.”
The report calls for reparations as an essential step to addressing the suffering inflicted by slavery and colonialism. Monetary compensation was important, the report said, but reparations “should not only be equated with financial compensation.” They could also include formal acknowledgment and apologies, educational reform and measures to commemorate the experience of people of African descent, it said.
Bachelet will present the report to the U.N. Human Rights Council next month at the start of a debate that will test the Biden administration’s willingness to engage on racism in a multilateral setting.
Last week, the State Department said it led an effort at the human rights council to address systemic racism in a statement that was signed by 158 countries.
“The United States will continue to engage the international community to find effective means to address systemic racism both at home and around the world,” Jalina Porter, deputy spokeswoman for the department, said Thursday.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a statement marking Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating of the end of slavery in the United States, said the country was already taking steps to root out issues of racism by “holding ourselves to the highest possible standards of accountability” and dealing with them transparently.

GENEVA — The U.N. human rights chief Monday urged nations to take action to root out systemic racism against people of African descent, as she released a report calling for measures to dismantle discrimination and for sweeping changes to policing, as well as reparations.
“The status quo is untenable,” Michelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. “Systemic racism needs a systemic response. There is today a momentous opportunity to achieve a turning point for racial equality and justice.”
The 20-page report and an accompanying 95-page conference paper draw on evidence from 60 countries. Work on them started after the May 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minnesota by a white police officer. Its release comes days after the officer, Derek Chauvin, was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison.
“We could not find a single example of a state that has fully reckoned with the past or comprehensively accounted for the impacts on the lives of people of African descent today,” said Mona Rishmawi, who supervised the preparation of the report.
The U.N. human rights office, which prepared the report, recommends creation of a commission or some other body with a one- or two-year mandate to scrutinize and monitor law enforcement.
It urges a reimagining of policing to address racial stereotyping, the militarization of weapons and tactics, and a lack of accountability.
The report draws on interviews with more than 340 people and more than 100 written submissions from civil society and academic organizations. It points to common patterns of experience for people of African descent in Europe, Latin America and North America contending with poverty and with barriers to education, health care, jobs and political participation.
The report spotlights the deaths of 190 people of African descent who died at the hands of law-enforcement officers, most of them in the United States, pointing out that few of the victims posed a threat.
It analyzes seven emblematic cases, including those involving Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the United States, together with cases from Brazil, Britain, Colombia and France. Only the death of Floyd has resulted in police being held to account.
But the deaths recorded in the preparation of this report were just “the tip of the iceberg,” Rishmawi noted. She cited a mother in Latin America who protested that “you always talk about George Floyd, every day we have a George Floyd and nobody talks about it.”
The report calls for reparations as an essential step to addressing the suffering inflicted by slavery and colonialism. Monetary compensation was important, the report said, but reparations “should not only be equated with financial compensation.” They could also include formal acknowledgment and apologies, educational reform and measures to commemorate the experience of people of African descent, it said.
Bachelet will present the report to the U.N. Human Rights Council next month at the start of a debate that will test the Biden administration’s willingness to engage on racism in a multilateral setting.
In a written statement Monday, the State Department said it had received a copy of the report that it supports “the amplification of victims’ voices, as well as those of their families and communities in all countries.”
The statement continued: “The United States is committed to treating every person with dignity, upholding human rights, championing opportunity, defending freedom, and strengthening the rule of law. We recognize that our country has not always lived up to these ideals, particularly for African Americans and other people of color.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Progressives’ Urgent Question: How to Win Over Voters of Color

Can progressives win broad numbers of the Black and brown voters they say their policies will benefit most?
That provocative question is one that a lot of Democrats find themselves asking after seeing the early results from New York City’s mayoral primary this past week.
In a contest that centered on crime and public safety, Eric Adams, who emerged as the leading Democrat, focused much of his message on denouncing progressive slogans and policies that he said threatened the lives of “Black and brown babies” and were being pushed by “a lot of young, white, affluent people.” A retired police captain and Brooklyn’s borough president, he rejected calls to defund the Police Department and pledged to expand its reach in the city.
Black and brown voters in Brooklyn and the Bronx flocked to his candidacy, awarding Adams with sizable leading margins in neighborhoods from Eastchester to East New York. Although the official winner may not be known for weeks because of the city’s new ranked-choice voting system, Adams holds a commanding edge in the race that will be difficult for his rivals to overcome.
His appeal adds evidence to an emerging trend in Democratic politics: a disconnect between progressive activists and the rank-and-file Black and Latino voters who they say have the most to gain from their agenda. As liberal activists orient their policies to combat white supremacy and call for racial justice, progressives are finding that many voters of color seem to think about the issues quite a bit differently.
“Black people talk about politics in more practical and everyday terms,” said Hakeem Jefferson, an assistant professor of political science at Stanford University who studies the political views of Black people. “What makes more sense for people who are often distrustful of broad political claims is something that’s more in the middle.”
He added: “The median Black voter is not AOC and is actually closer to Eric Adams,” referring to U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary race, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., struggled to win over voters of color. Four years later, Black voters helped lift President Joe Biden to victory in the Democratic primary, forming the backbone of the coalition that helped him defeat liberal rivals including Sanders and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
In the general election, Republican Donald Trump made gains with nonwhite voters, particularly Latinos, as Democrats saw a drop-off in support that cost the party key congressional seats, according to a postelection autopsy by Democratic interest groups. In the 2020 election, Trump made larger gains among all Black and Latino voters than he did among white voters without a college degree, according to Democratic data firm Catalist.
On issues beyond criminal justice, data indicates that Black and Latino voters are less likely to identify as liberal than white voters. An analysis by Gallup found that the share of white Democrats who identify as liberal had risen by 20 percentage points since the early 2000s. Over the same period, the polling firm found a 9-point rise in liberal identification among Latino Democrats and an 8-point increase among Black Democrats.
As votes were being tabulated in New York, Adams tried to capitalize on that tension between progressives and more-moderate voters of color, casting himself as the future of Democratic politics and his campaign as a template for the party.
“I am the face of the new Democratic Party,” he said at his first news conference after primary night. “If the Democratic Party fails to recognize what we did here in New York, they’re going to have a problem in the midterm elections and they’re going to have a problem in the presidential elections.”
Extrapolating national trends from the idiosyncratic politics of New York is a bit like ordering a bagel with schmear in Des Moines, Iowa. You’ll probably get a piece of bread, but the similarities may end there.
Liberal activists argue that they’ve made important breakthroughs among nonwhite voters in recent years, pointing to Sanders’ gains among Latinos and younger voters of color over the course of his two presidential bids. Progressive congressional candidates, including the members of the so-called Squad, have won several heavily Democratic House districts with meaningful support from nonwhite voters.
And of course, Black and Latino voters, like any demographic group, are hardly a monolith. Younger voters and those with college degrees are more likely to trend left than their older parents.
Still, the traction some more-conservative Democratic candidates such as Adams have gained in Black and Latino communities threatens to undercut a central tenet of the party’s political thinking for decades: demographics as destiny.
For years, Democrats have argued that as the country grew more diverse and more urban, their party would be able to marshal a near-permanent majority with a rising coalition of voters of color. By turning out that base, Democrats could win without needing to appeal to affluent suburbanites, who are traditionally more moderate on fiscal issues, or white working-class voters, who tend to hold more-conservative views on race and immigration.
But a growing body of evidence indicates that large numbers of Black and Latino voters may simply take a more centrist view on the very issues — race and criminal justice — that progressives assumed would rally voters of color to their side.
The New York mayoral primary provided a particularly interesting test case of that kind of thinking. As crime and gun violence rise in New York, polls showed that crime and public safety were the most important issues to voters in the mayoral race.
The limited public polling available showed nuanced opinions among voters of color on policing. A poll conducted for the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, found that just 17% of Black voters and 18% of Latinos wanted to decrease the number of police officers in their neighborhoods. But 62% of Black voters and 49% of Latino voters said they supported “defunding” the New York Police Department and spending the money on social workers instead, the poll found.
Other surveys found that Black and Latino voters were more likely than white voters to say that the number of uniformed police officers should be increased in the subways and that they felt unsafe from crime in their neighborhoods. Fears of violent crime led some leaders in predominantly Black neighborhoods to reject efforts to defund the police.
Progressive activists who backed Maya Wiley, one of the more liberal candidates in the race, accused Adams of “fearmongering” over rising crime rates in the city.
“Voters were offered a false dichotomy between justice and public safety by the Adams rhetoric,” said Sochie Nnaemeka, New York state's director of the Working Families Party. “We worked hard to dismantle that framework, but that dog-whistling does strike the real fear that people have when our streets are increasingly unsafe. It’s a very human experience.”
Yet Adams’ personal history may offer particular appeal to voters with complicated views on criminal justice. The former police officer built his political brand on criticizing the police, speaking out against police brutality and, later, the department’s stop-and-frisk tactics. After years in New York politics, he is a member of the party establishment, enjoying the advantages of name recognition and decades-old relationships with community leaders.
It’s the kind of biographical narrative likely to appeal to voters more likely to have intimate personal experiences with policing, who tend to live in neighborhoods that may have more crime but where people are also are more likely to face violence or abuse from officers.
Some scholars and strategists argue that Black and Latino voters are more likely to center their political beliefs on those kinds of experiences in their own lives, taking a pragmatic approach to politics that’s rooted less in ideology and more in a historical distrust of government and the ability of politicians to deliver on sweeping promises.
“These standard ways of thinking about ideology fall apart for Black Americans,” Jefferson said. “The idea of liberalism and conservatism just falls to the wayside.”
He added: “It’s just not the language Black folks are using to organize their politics.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Trump Aides Prepared Insurrection Act Order During Debate Over Protests

Responding to interest from President Donald Trump, White House aides drafted a proclamation last year to invoke the Insurrection Act in case Trump moved to take the extraordinary step of deploying active-duty troops in Washington to quell the protests that followed the killing of George Floyd, two senior Trump administration officials said.
The aides drafted the proclamation on June 1, 2020, during a heated debate inside the administration over how to respond to the protests. Trump, enraged by the demonstrations, had told the attorney general, William Barr, the defense secretary, Mark Esper, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff, Gen. Mark Milley, that he wanted thousands of active-duty troops on the streets of the nation’s capital, one of the officials said.
Trump was talked out of the plan by the three officials. But a separate group of White House staff members wanted to leave open the option for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to call in the military to patrol the streets of the capital.
They decided it would be prudent to have the necessary document vetted and ready in case the unrest in Washington worsened or the city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, declined to take measures such as a citywide curfew, which she ultimately put in place.
According to one former senior administration official, Trump was aware that the document was prepared. He never invoked the act, and in a statement to The New York Times he denied that he had wanted to deploy active-duty troops. “It’s absolutely not true and if it was true, I would have done it,” Trump said.
But the new details about internal White House deliberations on a pivotal day in his presidency underscore the intensity of Trump’s instinct to call on the active-duty military to deal with a domestic issue. And they help to flesh out the sequence of events that would culminate later in the day with Trump’s walk across Lafayette Park to St. John’s Church so he could pose in front of it holding a Bible, a move that coincided with a spasm of violence between law enforcement and protesters camped near the White House.
Although the main elements of what happened in and around the White House on June 1, 2020, have been well established, some aspects remain a subject of dispute. A federal watchdog concluded this month that the U.S. Park Police had been planning to clear protesters from Lafayette Park well before they learned that Trump was going to walk through the area. And a federal judge this week partly dismissed claims in a civil suit accusing the Trump administration of abusing its power in clearing the park.
A Trump adviser, echoing the former president’s insistence he did not want to deploy active-duty troops, said that Trump rejected the option when presented with it by advisers, and maintained that had he done so, he would have “owned the problem” politically.
Despite being convinced not to invoke the act, Trump continued to bring up the idea of deploying active-duty military in the weeks that followed, as unrest unfolded in major cities including New York, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon, the officials said.
Their accounts comport with others, including one in a forthcoming book by the Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender that says Trump repeatedly urged Milley and other top military and law enforcement officials throughout the summer to confront the protesters physically, according to excerpts from Bender’s book published by CNN.
The basic facts of Trump’s deliberations about how to respond to the protests that broke out after the killing of Floyd have been widely reported. NBC News reported on June 1, 2020, that Trump was considering invoking the Insurrection Act.
CNN later reported the White House wanted to deploy 10,000 troops onto the streets but that Esper and Milley pushed back on the idea.
But the new details help illustrate the intensity of Trump’s demands for militaristic action to curb the protests.
In the Oval Office on the morning of June 1, 2020, Trump was furious about the televised images he had seen of the unrest in Washington and elsewhere.
For roughly 20 minutes, according to the former officials, Trump went on about how to contain the protests. Milley and Esper appeared particularly stunned by Trump’s eruption, according to one of the officials.
Throughout Trump’s presidency, he had a broad view of his powers as president, claiming that he could take an array of aggressive actions using federal authorities and military personnel to handle problems typically left to local authorities.
But invoking the Insurrection Act, a rarely used authority allowing presidents to use active duty military for law-enforcement purposes, would have been a dramatic escalation. The act has only been invoked twice in the past 40 years — once to quell unrest after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and once during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
“We look weak,” Trump said, according to one of the officials. He complained about having been taken to the bunker below the White House on the night of May 29 when the barricade outside the Treasury Department was pierced. The New York Times had reported the bunker visit a day earlier, infuriating Trump.
But all three officials pushed back against the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act. Barr, who had been Trump’s attorney general for a year and a half and had been increasingly clashing with the president, told Trump that civilian law-enforcement authorities had enough personnel to manage the situation and that a drastic move like invoking the Insurrection Act could spawn more protests and violence. Esper agreed, according to the two former officials.
Trump’s meeting with Barr, Esper and Milley was marked by his rage at being embarrassed on the world stage, according to two of the officials.
Trump grudgingly went along with their counsel not to deploy active-duty troops, according to the officials. Immediately after the meeting, Trump joined a call with governors around the country, some of whom were seeing protests increase in their states. Trump urged them to “dominate” the protesters, as he said the National Guard in Minnesota had.
Esper told associates that he was so concerned that Trump would deploy active-duty troops that he echoed the need for them to get control of their states, hoping he could encourage governors to deploy the National Guard to head off federal action. Using Pentagon terminology that he later told associates he regretted, Esper told the governors to “dominate the battle space,” a sentiment stemming from concern about Trump’s intentions.
But one backdrop for the drafting of the Insurrection Act proclamation was that discussions between the White House and city officials about containing the protests remained contentious throughout the day. At one point, White House officials suggested taking over the city police force to tamp down the unrest and impose order. That idea stunned Washington city officials.
Esper — who, associates said, so feared the situation was spinning out of control that two days later he publicly said he opposed invoking the Insurrection Act — later tried to again communicate the gravity with which he feared Trump would act when he held a handful of private calls with specific governors that afternoon, according to the former senior administration official.
Trump delivered a Rose Garden address later that evening, saying he was prepared to deploy the military if the rioting did not cease.
“If the city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residence, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said.
Active-duty military, including from the 82nd Airborne Division, were airlifted to bases outside Washington, but Esper mobilized a National Guard deployment in the city in an effort to thwart them being deployed. By June 5, they were all ordered to return to their home bases. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

In 2017, a German soldier was discovered living an elaborate double life. 1st Lt. Franco A., whose surname is abbreviated in keeping with German privacy laws, faked a Syrian identity and posed as a refugee, only to be arrested 16 months later while retrieving a loaded gun in an airport bathroom. The mysterious case cracked the door open to a network of far-right extremists inside the German military and the police. They are preparing for the collapse of democracy — a coming apocalypse they call Day X.
In a New York Times audio series, Day X, we explore the recent resurgence of the far right in Germany. It’s a story about a changing national identity — and the backlash against it — raising a question that democracies across the world are waking up to: What happens when the threat is coming from within?
While the series is focused on Germany’s present, it’s also a story inseparable from Germany’s past. Below, we set out some key moments for the far right in modern Germany, and highlight some earlier events that may help to understand the threat is poses.
June 28, 1919: The Treaty of Versailles
Just over a century ago, after accepting its defeat in World War I through an armistice, the German government signed the Treaty of Versailles, in which the victorious Allies set the terms and price of peace.
The treaty declared Germany to blame for the war and ordered it to pay vast reparations, limit its armed forces and surrender territory. These bitter concessions became emblems of a powerful myth, particularly widespread among veterans: that Germany’s military could have won the war, but instead had been betrayed and humiliated by the civilian leadership.
This toxic conspiracy theory, known as the “stab-in-the-back legend,” became a keystone of Nazi propaganda, in which the civilian leaders were portrayed as the puppets of leftists and Jews. It animated groups that plotted coups and assassinated politicians in the decade before Hitler came to power. In Day X, Katrin Bennhold, The Times’ Berlin bureau chief, interviews Franco A., a military officer on trial on charges of plotting terrorism. Like the members of the paramilitary groups in the 1920s, Franco A. believes in a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the German nation, and he is accused of plotting one or several assassinations meant to bring down the democratic government.
Feb. 24, 1920: The Nazi Party is founded
After the war, many newly unemployed soldiers in Germany joined paramilitary groups that eventually supported the rise of Nazism — a history that helps explain why Germans are so alarmed by recent evidence of far-right sympathies among soldiers. The National Socialist German Workers’ Party, or Nazi Party, emerged late in 1919 and took its notorious name in early 1920, quickly developing a paramilitary wing itself. After years of building support on the fringe, the party found its ultranationalist message — and the speeches of its leader, Adolf Hitler — gaining new traction in the economic hardship of the Great Depression.
Jan. 30, 1933: Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor
Hitler’s Nazi Party became the largest in the German parliament by July 1932, but it would be six months before conservative parties joined it in a coalition, betting that they could steer the resulting government.
Instead, within weeks, Hitler began transforming Germany into a nationalist, anti-Semitic dictatorship — censoring the press, installing his paramilitaries in state roles, suspending civil liberties and purging Jewish civil servants. In modern German politics, it’s remembered as a warning against any political coalition that might grant extremists legitimacy — a taboo that has recently come under strain.
September 1939: World War II begins
In the years leading up to the war, Hitler expanded Germany’s military and undertook a campaign of aggression that gloried in reversing the concessions of Versailles, initially to little resistance from powerful neighbors like Britain and France. Their breaking point came on the morning of Sept. 1, 1939, when Hitler ordered a ground offensive to invade Poland — triggering the start of what would become World War II.
Feb. 13-15, 1945: Dresden is destroyed
Germans are taught carefully about their country’s crimes during World War II — above all, about the systematic murder of 6 million European Jews in the campaign of genocide that became known as the Holocaust.
But recent years have seen growing public discussion of Germans’ own wartime suffering. One focus is the eastern city of Dresden, devastated by a British-American bombing raid in the war’s waning months.
The Nazi propaganda ministry declared the bombing a “terror attack,” circulating reports that up to 200,000 people had perished. The figure persisted for decades, though researchers now put the casualties closer to 25,000.
Germany’s far right has long leveraged a sense of German victimhood to promote a revisionist view of the Nazi era. Every February, neo-Nazis march in Dresden to commemorate the bombing. Franco A., who says his own grandmother witnessed the Dresden bombing, weighs it against the Holocaust in voice memos he recorded.
May 7, 1945: Germany surrenders
After the bombing of Dresden, Allied troops marched toward Berlin, liberating concentration camps along the way. With defeat imminent, Hitler killed himself on April 30, 1945. Soon after, on May 7, Gen. Alfred Jodl announced the unconditional surrender of German forces.
Leading figures in the Nazi regime were put on trial for crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg Trials, as this postwar judicial process was known, were a public reckoning for German war crimes followed around the world.
Sept. 21 and Oct. 7, 1949: West and East Germany are founded
After Germany was defeated, its territory was divided and occupied by American, British, French and Soviet forces. By 1949, the Western powers consolidated their three zones into the Federal Republic of Germany, known as West Germany, while the Soviets formed the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany.
The Western powers advanced an agenda of democratization — but also allowed many former Nazis to keep their jobs in government and in business. A more complete reckoning with the horrors of the Holocaust wouldn’t come for over a decade.
In East Germany, the Soviets were far more aggressive in hunting down former Nazis, even as the new country came under increasingly isolated communist rule.
March 25, 1957: The Treaty of Rome is signed
In the decades after World War II, western European countries sought to build systems of cooperation that would make another war across their continent impossible. The Treaty of Rome was the foundation stone of perhaps the most ambitious: The European Economic Community, a common market across six nations that would develop into today’s 27-country European Union. West Germany was among the founders, reflecting a hope that limiting the power of single nations would serve as an antidote to violent nationalism.
Aug. 13, 1961: The Berlin Wall rises
Germany’s old capital, Berlin, sat within the new East Germany but was divided between East and West, making it a front line in the developing Cold War. As millions of East Germans fled through the city to the increasingly prosperous West, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev recommended the construction of a barrier dividing Berlin. The Berlin Wall came to symbolize the “Iron Curtain” dividing democratic Western Europe and communist Eastern Europe.
1968: A youth movement spreads across West Germany
In the decade after the construction of the wall, the divide between West and East grew starker.
As countercultural movements swept across the United States, West Germany had its own reckoning. University students rebelled against the silence of their parents’ generation and forced the country to have a conversation about the country’s Nazi past. Claudia Roth, a vice president of the German parliament and one of the alleged targets of Franco A., talks about her experience of this moment in Episode 2 of Day X.
East Germany never had a comparable societal reckoning. The eastern regime defined itself in the tradition of communists who had resisted fascism, giving rise to a state doctrine of remembrance that effectively exculpated it from wartime atrocities.
Behind the wall, however, the East was frozen in time, a largely homogeneous white country where nationalism quietly lived on.
Nov. 9, 1989: The Berlin Wall falls
Through its history, at least 140 people died at the Berlin Wall, the vast majority of them trying to escape.
When the wall eventually fell in late 1989, the result of human error, spontaneity and individual courage, East Germans crossed into the west, leaving a state of informers and suspicions, public rigidity and private despair to emerge, disoriented, into another world.
It was a moment of national euphoria and liberation. But it also marked the beginning of a wave of racist attacks that swept across the country as a predominantly white East met a multicultural West.
Abenaa Adomako remembers that night. Joyous and curious like so many of her fellow West Germans, she had gone to the city center to greet East Germans who were pouring across the border for a first taste of freedom.
“Welcome,” she beamed at a disoriented-looking couple in the crowd, offering them sparkling wine. But they would not take it.
“They spat at me and called me names,” recalled Adomako, whose family has been in Germany since the 1890s. “They were the foreigners in my country. But to them, as a Black woman, I was the foreigner.”
Oct. 3, 1990: Germany is reunified
A unification treaty was ratified in the German parliament in the fall of 1990, bringing West and East Germany under one democratic government.
But unification also brought far-right groups in the West and East together.
“Reunification was a huge boost for the far right,” said Ingo Hasselbach, who was then a clandestine neo-Nazi in East Berlin. After the fall of the wall, Hasselbach, who has since disaffiliated, connected with western extremists and organized far-right workshops, fought street battles with leftists and celebrated Hitler’s birthday. Together, they also dreamed of a far-right party in the parliament of a reunified Germany — a dream that would come true nearly three decades later.
Nov. 24, 1990 : The new Germany witnesses an anti-immigrant murder
Seven weeks after reunification, a group of young skinheads went in search of foreigners overnight in the eastern town of Eberswalde. They came upon an Angolan guest worker, Amadeu Antonio Kiowa, 28, beating him and others with baseball bats. According to Human Rights Watch, several police officers looked on during the violence.
Kiowa died 12 days after the attack, and his death, as well as the light sentences for his murderers, prompted a political debate in the newly reunified Germany over how the state would respond to right-wing violence. He is commemorated in the name of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, an anti-racist organization whose leader, Anetta Kahane, is among those Franco A. is accused of targeting. Kahane speaks about her experiences in Episode 2 of Day X.
E arly 1990s: A series of anti-immigrant attacks shock the country
There were other far-right attacks in the years immediately after reunification. In August 1992, a crowd estimated at 1,000 youths from both eastern and western Germany and described as mostly neo-Nazis firebombed a 10-story refugee hostel in the northern town of Rostock.
Then, on Nov. 23, a woman and two girls, all of Turkish nationality, died after firebombs were thrown into their home in Mölln, another town in northern Germany. Minutes after the bombs were thrown, anonymous callers telephoned local police and fire departments, taking responsibility for the fires and crying, “Heil Hitler!” Two far-right extremists were later convicted.
And on May 29, 1993, five members of a Turkish family, two young women and three girls, burned to death in their house in Solingen, in a fire set by neo-Nazis.
2000-11: A neo-Nazi terror cell murders immigrants, while the police look for Turkish gangsters
For over a decade, a series of murders in Germany went unsolved. Of the 10 victims, nine were immigrants. Newspapers referred to the killings as “döner murders,” which the families of the victims found demeaning and even racist. The police ignored suggestions that the murders might have been hate crimes and narrowly focused their investigations on Turkish organized crime.
The case went nowhere. Until, one day in 2011, a botched escape after a bank robbery revealed that a neo-Nazi terror group, the National Socialist Underground, was responsible for the killings.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said the case revealed “structures that we never imagined.” And after the German intelligence service shredded documents salient to the case, some questioned whether the agency may have been infiltrated by double agents loyal to the far right. Later, in 2018, a lawyer for one of the victims’ families, Seda Basay-Yildiz, received a death threat linked to a police computer. Basay-Yildiz speaks in Episode 3 of Day X.
November 2003: A special forces commander is dismissed
Gen. Reinhard Günzel, the commander of the KSK, Germany’s most elite and highly trained military unit, was dismissed after he wrote a letter in support of an anti-Semitic speech by a conservative lawmaker.
General Günzel subsequently published a book called “Secret Warriors.” In it, he placed the KSK in the tradition of a notorious special forces unit under the Nazis that committed numerous war crimes, including massacres of Jews. He has since been a popular speaker at far-right events.
Nov. 22, 2005: Angela Merkel is elected as German chancellor
Angela Merkel, leader of the center-right party, the Christian Democrats, took office in a left-right coalition in Germany in late 2005, becoming both the first female chancellor and reunified Germany’s first leader to have grown up in the East. She moved her party firmly to the center, becoming recognized worldwide as a face of democratic tolerance and pragmatism.
Feb. 6, 2013: A new party takes shape on the right
It was frustration with Merkel’s centrism — and especially her decision to commit German taxpayer money to a bailout of Greece — that a group of elite conservatives cited when they began a party of their own, one that initially made skepticism of European integration the center of its message: the Alternative for Germany, widely known by its German initials, AfD.
2015-16: Over 1 million migrants arrive in Germany
The Syrian War, the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and widespread poverty fueled a wide-reaching migrant crisis in 2015. More than 1.3 million people applied for asylum in the European Union that year, after dangerous and sometimes deadly journeys.
Faced with a test of compassion, Merkel’s response was dramatic. She welcomed more than 1 million asylum-seekers into Germany.
In response, the AfD shifted its policies and messaging to focus on domestic security and immigration. Its popularity grew, especially in eastern cities, as its tone became increasingly nationalistic, populistic and — its critics said — racist.
Oct. 17, 2015: A pro-refugee politician is stabbed
Henriette Reker, a candidate to be mayor of Cologne, was handing out flowers to voters at a bustling market when a man who wanted to punish her for her pro-refugee stance took a rose with one hand and rammed a kitchen knife into her throat with the other. The attack put her in an intensive care unit; she awoke from a coma to find herself elected.
April 27, 2017 : A German military officer is arrested — and nationwide far-right networks begin coming to light
In 2017, a mysterious gun was found in an airport bathroom. The gun ultimately led to the arrest of a German military officer, Franco A. He is accused of posing as a refugee in what investigators say was an assassination plot intended to take down the German government. Franco A. denies this, and has said he was trying to expose flaws in the asylum system.
His case set off a sprawling investigation that led German authorities into a labyrinth of extremist networks at all levels of the nation’s security services — a threat that, they acknowledged in 2020, was far more extensive than they had ever imagined.
One group, run by a former soldier and police sniper in northern Germany, hoarded weapons, kept enemy lists and ordered body bags. Another, run by a special-forces soldier code-named Hannibal, put the spotlight on the KSK, Germany’s most elite force.
Sept. 24, 2017: The far right is elected into Germany’s parliament
The first federal elections since the arrival of over 1 million migrants returned Merkel to office. But voter anger over immigration and inequality showed in a drop in support for the two main parties, and a shocking surge for the AfD, which received nearly 13% of the vote on an anti-migration platform. It was the first time since the Nazi era that a far-right party had gained enough support to enter the German parliament.
August 2018: Anti-immigrant riots attract both neo-Nazis and far-right voters
Days of neo-Nazi protests broke out in Chemnitz, in eastern Germany, after word spread that an Iraqi and a Syrian asylum-seeker were suspected in a knife attack that had killed a German man. While neo-Nazis had a long tradition of demonstrations in Chemnitz, these riots were different.
The crowds were at times 8,000-strong. Led by several hundred identifiable neo-Nazis, they also appeared to be joined by thousands of ordinary citizens.
“This mix of far-right extremists and AfD voters was new,” said Hajo Funke, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin and a veteran expert on the far right.
The country was shocked by images of the angry mob marching through the streets, chasing after bystanders they thought looked foreign. Police officers, vastly outnumbered, were too afraid to intervene.
Sept. 18, 2018: A spy chief is removed from office
Hans-Georg Maassen, Germany’s chief of domestic intelligence, was removed from his post after he questioned the authenticity of a video showing an immigrant being chased by far-right protesters in Chemnitz, directly contradicting Merkel. Their public rift renewed questions about whether Germany’s security apparatus had minimized the threat of the far right — especially as Maassen was appointed to overhaul the service after the National Socialist Underground murders came to light.
June 2, 2019: A politician is assassinated
Walter Lübcke, a regional politician representing Merkel’s party, became a target for far-right death threats because of his uncompromising defense of her refugee policy.
Then, after years of abuse from extremists, Lübcke was fatally shot in the head on his terrace, in what was Germany’s first far-right political assassination since the Nazi era. His murderer had a violent neo-Nazi past and police record; he was convicted of the murder in January and sentenced to life in prison.
Oct. 9, 2019: A synagogue is attacked
On Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, a heavily armed nationalist and white supremacist tried to storm a synagogue in Halle, eastern Germany, while streaming it live online from a head camera. Foiled by a locked door, he killed two people outside and wounded two others; 51 people were inside.
The attacker, who was 28, received a life sentence for murder and attempted murder the following year.
Feb. 19, 2020: Another far-right gunman strikes, this time in the West
A far-right extremist opened fire at two hookah bars in Hanau, east of Frankfurt, in the winter of 2020, killing nine mostly young people in Germany’s deadliest far-right attack in recent memory. He later returned home, where he shot and killed his mother and himself.
The attack shocked Germany and drove home a fear that no part of the country is immune to the potential for far-right violence.
July 2020: Germany’s defense minister disbands a company of the special forces
Germany’s defense minister announced that she would partially disband the KSK, Germany’s elite special forces unit, saying it had been infiltrated by far-right extremism.
The defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said far-right extremism had become so pervasive in one of four fighting companies inside the special forces that it would be dissolved, and the rest would be overhauled.
“The KSK cannot continue in its current form,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference, describing “toxic leadership” inside the unit, which, she added, had “developed and promoted extremist tendencies.”
The announcement came seven weeks after investigators discovered a trove of Nazi memorabilia and an extensive arsenal of stolen ammunition and explosives on the property of a sergeant major who had served in the KSK since 2001.
Aug. 29, 2020 : Far-right protesters attempt to storm the German parliament
Hundreds of far-right activists waving the black, white and red flag of the pre-1918 German Empire broke through a police barrier and tried to force their way into the German parliament building during a protest against Germany’s pandemic response.
It took only a few tense minutes before the police, soon aided by reinforcements, managed to push them back. But the events were an alarming escalation of pandemic protests that have grown steadily bigger and — on the fringes at least — angrier. The AfD has tried to exploit the pandemic in the same way it used the refugee crisis in 2015.
Sept. 16, 2020: 29 police officers are suspended on suspicion of sharing violent neo-Nazi propaganda
A police force in Germany suspended 29 officers suspected of sharing images of Hitler and violent neo-Nazi propaganda in at least five online chat groups, adding to concerns about far-right infiltration. The 126 images shared included swastikas, a fabricated picture of a refugee in a gas chamber and the shooting of a Black man, officials said.
After an investigation, additional officers in the unit were suspended, bringing the total to 44. Currently, 24 of those officers are still suspended.
Several other cases have since emerged. Authorities recently disbanded an elite police unit in Frankfurt and suspended 18 of its members after they were also found to have been involved in a chat group that exchanged racist messages and glorified the Nazis.
March 2021 : The German intelligence service declares the AfD a threat
For the first time in its postwar history, Germany placed its main opposition party, the AfD, under surveillance. While the country’s domestic intelligence agency hoped to tap phones and other communications and monitor the movements of AfD members, the party legally challenged this decision. A court forced the intelligence agency to suspend surveillance activities in the interim.
Still, the decision was among the most sweeping efforts yet to deal with the rise of far-right and neo-Nazi political movements within Western democracies.
May 20, 2021: Franco A. goes on trial
In May, federal prosecutors laid out their case against Franco A. in the opening of one of postwar Germany’s most spectacular terrorism trials. They said he had been motivated by a “hardened far-right extremist mindset” to plot political murder in the hope of provoking a backlash against refugees meant to bring down the Federal Republic of Germany. Franco A. denies the terrorism charges against him. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
MINNEAPOLIS — Derek Chauvin, the former police officer convicted of murder in the death of George Floyd, was sentenced Friday to 22 1/2 years in prison, bringing a measure of closure to a case that set off waves of protest across the nation over police abuse of Black people.
The sentence, delivered by Judge Peter A. Cahill of Hennepin County District Court, came more than a year after a widely shared cellphone video captured Chauvin pressing his knee on the neck of Floyd for more than nine minutes along a Minneapolis street. Earlier this year, Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder, and the sentence followed emotional statements in court Friday by members of Floyd’s family as well as by Chauvin’s mother.
Chauvin, who spoke only briefly during the hearing Friday, offering condolences to the Floyd family, has been behind bars since his trial, which ended in April. The judge said Chauvin would be credited with 199 days already served toward his sentence. Officials said he was being kept in solitary confinement for his own safety.
Before the sentencing hearing, Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, had pressed the court for leniency, asking for probation and time served. Nelson wrote in a memorandum that Chauvin had not known that he was committing a crime when he tried to arrest Floyd on a report that he had tried to use a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Nelson also argued that placing Chauvin in prison would make him a target of other inmates.
In seeking a 30-year prison sentence for Chauvin, prosecutors had argued that the former officer’s actions had “traumatized Mr. Floyd’s family, the bystanders who watched Mr. Floyd die, and the community. And his conduct shocked the nation’s conscience.”
The killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, by Chauvin, 45, who is white, led to a national reckoning over racial injustice in almost every aspect of American life. Calls emerged around the country to defund police budgets, remove statues of historical figures tied to racism and diversify predominantly white corporate boards.
The maximum sentence allowed under Minnesota law for second-degree murder, the most serious charge Chauvin was convicted of, is 40 years. Under Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines, though, a presumptive sentence for someone like Chauvin with no criminal history is 12.5 years. The jury, which deliberated for just over 10 hours following a six week trial, also convicted Chauvin of third-degree murder and manslaughter.
In recent weeks, Cahill had ruled that four so-called “aggravating factors” applied to the case, raising the prospect of a harsher sentence. The judge found that Chauvin acted with particular cruelty; acted with the participation of three other individuals, who were fellow officers; abused his position of authority; and committed his crime in the presence of children, who witnessed the killing on a Minneapolis street corner on May 25, 2020.
Chauvin’s conviction was a rare rebuke by the criminal justice system against a police officer who killed someone while on duty. Officers are often given wide latitude to use force, and juries have historically been reluctant to second guess them, especially when they make split-second decisions under dangerous circumstances.
Chauvin is one of 11 police officers who have been convicted of murder for on-duty killings since 2005, according to research conducted by Philip M. Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University. The lightest sentence has been just less than seven years in prison, while the harshest was 40 years. The average sentence has been 21.7 years.
Chauvin’s sentencing Friday, while a significant milestone, does not end the legal proceedings concerning Floyd’s death. Chauvin still faces criminal charges in federal court, where he is accused of violating Floyd’s constitutional rights. And three other police officers face a state trial, scheduled for March, on charges of aiding and abetting. Those officers, too, were indicted by a federal grand jury as well.

MINNEAPOLIS — For the past two months, Derek Chauvin has been held in solitary confinement as lawyers and investigators have been busy with the next phase of his case: determining the duration of his punishment for the murder of George Floyd.
On Friday afternoon, Chauvin, 45, will return to the courthouse in downtown Minneapolis where he was convicted in April to learn his fate. Prosecutors are asking that Chauvin face 30 years in prison, while his defense team has requested probation. The maximum sentence allowed by law is 40 years.
The sentencing hearing is expected to last at least an hour and to include statements from members of Floyd’s family, who may speak about his life and how his death has affected them. The gruesome killing of Floyd as Chauvin, a former police officer, held a knee on his neck for more than nine minutes was captured on cellphone video and drew millions of Americans to the streets to protest against racial injustice and police brutality toward Black people.
Chauvin, who is white, did not testify at his six-week trial, in March and April. He spoke only once, outside the presence of the jury, to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to take the stand.
Chauvin will be permitted to speak at his sentencing hearing on Friday, but legal experts said it is unlikely he would choose to do so. Any remarks, they said, could be considered in future federal court proceedings, where Chauvin faces additional charges, and might complicate an appeal of his state conviction.
Under Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines, the presumptive sentence for a person like Chauvin, who had no previous criminal history, is 12.5 years for second-degree murder, the most serious of three charges he was convicted on. After deliberating for about 10 hours, a jury also convicted him of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
But the judge who will decide Chauvin’s sentence, Peter A. Cahill, has already ruled that four “aggravating factors” apply in the case, which would allow Cahill to deliver a longer sentence than Minnesota’s guidelines call for. The judge found that Chauvin acted with particular cruelty; acted with the participation of three other individuals, who were fellow officers; abused his position of authority; and committed his crime in the presence of children, who witnessed the killing on a Minneapolis street corner on May 25 2020.
Chauvin’s conviction was a rare rebuke by the criminal justice system against a police officer who killed someone while on duty. Officers are often given wide latitude to use force, and juries have historically been reluctant to second guess them, especially when they make split-second decisions under dangerous circumstances.
According to research conducted by Philip M. Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, 11 police officers, including Chauvin, have been convicted of murder for on-duty killings since 2005. The lightest sentence has been just under seven years in prison, while the harshest was 40 years. The average sentence has been 21.7 years.
Most legal experts said they expected Cahill to deliver a sentence closer to the 30 years the prosecution has asked for than the far shorter guideline sentence of 12.5 years. With good behavior, Chauvin would likely serve two-thirds of any prison sentence and the rest on parole.
“I would hope that Judge Cahill sentences Derek Chauvin to the maximum amount of time in prison,” Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and activist, said recently in a public forum held by the Legal Rights Center, a Twin Cities nonprofit group that provides indigent defense and advocates for criminal justice reform. “But I believe that he will probably strike somewhere in the middle, between the lowest and the highest possible sentence he could have.”
In a memorandum seeking a 30-year sentence, the prosecution team wrote: “Such a sentence would properly account for the profound impact of defendant’s conduct on the victim, the victim’s family, and the community. Defendant brutally murdered Mr. Floyd, abusing the authority conferred by his badge. His actions traumatized Mr. Floyd’s family, the bystanders who watched Mr. Floyd die, and the community. And his conduct shocked the nation’s conscience.”
Eric J. Nelson, Chauvin’s attorney, has pressed for leniency, asking that Chauvin be granted probation and a penalty of the time he already has served behind bars.
In a memorandum to the judge, Nelson wrote that the life expectancy of police officers is lower than the general population, and said that Chauvin has been diagnosed with heart damage.
Nelson also argued that placing Chauvin in prison would make him a target of other inmates, pointing to the fact that Chauvin has already been placed in solitary confinement for his own safety. Nelson wrote that Chauvin was a product of a “broken system” though he offered no elaboration.
The lawyer’s memorandum offered no sense of regret for what had happened. “Mr. Chauvin was unaware he was even committing a crime,” Nelson wrote. “In fact, in his mind, he was simply performing his lawful duty in assisting other officers in the arrest of George Floyd.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Law Banning Chokeholds In New York Is Overturned: [National Desk]

Full text: In a victory for police unions, a state Supreme Court judge said a law passed by the City Council is too vaguely worded.
In a victory for the city's powerful police unions, a state Supreme Court judge struck down a city law banning police officers' use of chokeholds and other physical restraints on Tuesday, saying the wording of the law was "unconstitutionally vague."
The law, passed last summer, had been met with fierce resistance from police unions, who sued the city last fall over its passage. The language of the statute -- which forbids officers from compressing a suspect's diaphragm -- was overly broad, the suit said, and made it nearly impossible for officers to physically engage suspects, even if the use of force was in good faith.
Justice Laurence L. Love agreed: "The phrase 'compresses the diaphragm' cannot be adequately defined as written," he wrote in his ruling in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The judge encouraged the city to revise its law, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, at his daily news conference on Wednesday, urged lawmakers to move quickly to do so.
Hank Sheinkopf, a spokesman for the coalition of police unions that filed the suit, said that having such a vague standard hindered police officers from effectively doing their jobs. "That's not only dangerous for cops -- it's bad for public safety," he said. "This ruling makes clear that protecting the public and the ability of public safety civil servants to do their work are inseparable."
The law had been part of a flurry of reforms that the City Council passed in the wake of widespread protests -- including huge demonstrations in New York -- following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last summer.
The use of chokeholds by police officers is already a felony crime under New York State law and is against New York Police Department policy. The City Council law forbade broader methods of restraint, saying any application of pressure to a person's neck or kneeling on a person's back or torso could be prosecuted as a misdemeanor.
Nearly since its inception, the language of the law was the subject of controversy. Even advocates for police reform said it might have been too broad and would be difficult to hold up in court.
Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said when the law passed that it would most likely be difficult to bring a case to court under the new statute. And the Staten Island district attorney, Michael McMahon, vowed not to prosecute officers who accidentally violated the law in the course of their jobs.
Facing criticism and a wave of shootings, some city lawmakers moved to revise the law last August, clarifying that the force had to be "recklessly" applied to be illegal, an effort that never made it to a vote.
Applauding the judge's ruling on Tuesday, Edward D. Mullins, the head of the sergeant's union, said in an email to members that it "sends a clear message to the City Council and the mayor that their anti-police policies will be challenged and defeated."
But Justice Love did not completely side with the unions. He rejected their arguments that the city law was pre-empted by the state's chokehold ban, saying that the unions had failed to show that the city law banned conduct permitted under state law or that it interfered with state regulations.
In his ruling, Justice Love acknowledged that the city and police department "have taken great pains to reduce the risks" of chokeholds by implementing new policies and training that restricts officers from sitting, kneeling or standing on the chest or back of a person under any circumstances.
"It is this court's sincere hope that the New York City Council will revisit this issue to address this vital matter," he said.
Eric Adams, the likely Democratic nominee for mayor, said on Thursday that he favored revising the law, calling the Council bill "not realistic" because it failed to take into account times when an officer might be "fighting for life and death" or to protect civilians.
The best way to address the court's concerns was to refine the law and pass an updated version quickly, Mr. de Blasio said.
"The underlying concept of the law is to protect lives of people, to create fairness and justice," he said. "We have to do that in the context, obviously, of also protecting public safety and making it clear that our officers need clear rules to do their jobs well."

Eric Adams Promises to ‘Show America How to Run a City’

NEW YORK — Two days after Eric Adams emerged as the likely Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, he made it clear that he would revamp New York’s approach to dealing with crime and suggested that other big cities and the national Democratic Party would be wise to follow suit.
Speaking in the tones of a mayor-elect, Adams laid out a middle road between progressives and conservatives: Fight racism in policing but step back from a progressive movement that has seen cities slash police budgets, ban police chokeholds and allow more people charged with crimes to be released without bail.
On gun control, he called for changing the national focus from assault rifles — which capture attention for their use in mass shootings, especially in suburban schools — to handguns. They are the main weapons in shootings in cities from New York to Atlanta and Detroit, he said, but because most of the victims, like most of the shooters, are “Black and brown, we’ve decided it’s not an issue.”
“If the Democratic Party fails to recognize what we did here in New York, they’re going to have a problem in the midterm elections and they’re going to have a problem in the presidential election,” Adams said at a news conference outside Brooklyn Borough Hall.
Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, holds a commanding lead in the race for the Democratic nomination; after a count of most ballots cast in person, he had nearly 32% of first-place votes. He led Maya Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, by 9 points, and Kathryn Garcia, a former sanitation commissioner, by 12 points.
The final outcome awaits the city’s new system of ranked-choice voting, where voters select as many as five candidates in order of preference. Thousands of votes will be shifted among the candidates before a final winner is declared. Tens of thousands of absentee ballots must also be counted, and the entire process may take until July 12.
But Adams spent Thursday on a semi-victory lap, taking a bike ride across Brooklyn and using a series of television interviews to lay out his vision for New York and beyond.
“I am the face of the new Democratic Party,” he said to cheers from several Black civil servants who were on the way to work in Downtown Brooklyn and to friendly horn toots from a passing city bus. “I’m going to show America how to run a city.”
Much of Adams’ campaign has been centered on public safety, and he continued to focus on that theme Thursday.
He said he planned to choose a woman as police commissioner, adding that he had already talked to three candidates. He said he would judge candidates by “character” and by their willingness to “create new incentives” for precinct commanders, to promote not based on how many arrests they make but “how many crimes they prevent.”
He urged people to consider what he called “shades of gray” on several contentious policing issues, including a policy change last year in New York that barred judges, in most cases, from requiring cash bail payments. That let more people charged with crimes go free until trial.
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has blamed the city’s spike in violent crime on that shift, without concrete evidence. Adams said on MSNBC that while some judges have kept people needlessly behind bars, “too many people are being released that are dangerous.”
Adams said that with a first-time firearms possession arrest, there may be a way to “put this person on the right pathway” without jail, but someone with several such arrests needs to do prison time.
Adams, a former police captain, also took a nuanced position on police chokeholds; a City Council bill banning the practice was recently overturned in state Supreme Court because the wording of the legislation was vague, the court found.
He said that he was opposed to the use of chokeholds because of cases of people being killed by police using the tactic. But he said the City Council bill banning the practice was “not realistic” because it did not take into account the times when an officer might be “fighting for life and death” or to protect civilians.
“I know what it is to try to wrestle a knife out of someone’s hand,” said Adams, adding that he was in favor of revising the law.
Even as he rejected some progressive-branded policies, Adams embraced some ideas popular with the young, multiracial constituency that supported candidates like Wiley and Dianne Morales and their call for using strategies outside policing, like improving mental health and social services, to prevent crimes.
“We need to change the ecosystem of public safety,” he said, with layered strategies of "prevention, a long-term plan and an intervention” to deal with the current spike in crime. He made it clear that he believed that he could marry the ideals of safety and ensuring social justice.
“America is saying, we want to have justice and safety and end inequality,” he said.
Adams acknowledged that that message alone was not enough to win the votes of a majority of New Yorkers; even though he held a significant lead, nearly 70% of voters ranked other candidates as their first choice. Still, in four of the city’s five boroughs, he collected the most in-person votes, trailing Garcia only in Manhattan.
Adams said the discrepancy showed that voters in wealthier, whiter districts saw the public safety crisis through a different lens.
“It’s unfortunate that I think a numerical minority that live, basically, they live in safe spaces, don’t understand what’s happening in this city,” Adams said.
If elected mayor, Adams will no doubt face challenges from the City Council, which is facing a complete overhaul next year: All 51 seats are up for election, and a new officeholder is guaranteed in 32 of them. The turnover is expected to shift the council, which already favored more aggressive policing reform, even more to the left.
“It’s not going to be a repeat of the Giuliani years,” said Susan Kang, an associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “The City Council is not going to just say whatever you say.”
The mayoral race is not over. Both Wiley and Garcia believe they have paths to victory. Garcia’s campaign shared a memo saying they expected her to cut into Adams’ lead after the absentee ballots — slightly more than 100,000 had been received from Democratic voters — are counted. Many of those received by the Board of Elections have come from areas like Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where Garcia did well.
Wiley’s advisers said they expect her to outperform Adams and Garcia in second- and third-choice votes. All three candidates have said that they support ranked-choice voting and will respect the outcome, including Adams, who has retreated from his and allies’ earlier suggestion that his rivals’ ranked-choice campaign tactics were an effort to suppress Black and Latino votes.

A Requiem, Derailed by the Pandemic, Arrives When It’s Needed Most

You’ve probably heard a story like this before. Courtney Bryan’s Requiem was set to premiere with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in late March 2020. In a time of incalculable loss, her music became part of another kind of casualty: the sounds that vanished from stages around the world.
Like many premieres originally planned for the past year, Bryan’s Requiem, written for the vocal quartet Quince Ensemble and members of the Chicago Symphony, was stranded in limbo. But through the orchestra’s turn to online programming and a season-ending series organized by Missy Mazzoli, its composer in residence, the piece was given a new date this week, when the latest episode of CSO Sessions lands on the streaming platform CSOtv.
Maybe it’s actually more fitting that the Requiem be released now, as the United States emerges from its worst days of the pandemic — over 600,000 deaths later — and the country celebrates its first federally recognized Juneteenth, a year after the emotional, nationwide peak of the Black Lives Matter movement following the murder of George Floyd.
“I think about the loss in my own life, but I know that a lot of people have had a lot of losses during this time, due to COVID and other situations,” Bryan said in a recent interview. “So I’m really happy that this is the actual premiere.”
Bryan, who is based in and from New Orleans, is a composer and performer who deals in collaboration, with an open ear to traditions like jazz and gospel — and, occasionally, to topics around racial justice like Black Lives Matter. In “Sanctum” (2015), she wove live orchestral playing in with sounds including the voices of demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri. Her oratorio “Yet Unheard” (2016) commemorated the life of Sandra Bland.
Her Requiem was meant to be more abstract — haunted by contemporary tragedies, perhaps, but not explicitly tied to any one in particular. It draws from a broad range of inspirations, including death rituals from the Anglican Church, “The Tibetan Book of the Dead,” Neoshamanism’s death rite known as the “great death spiral” and New Orleans jazz funerals, as well as text from the Bible and the traditional Catholic Mass.
Its five movements — Bryan associates that number with life — begin with a gentle, a cappella harmony built from elemental “mmm” sounds before each of the four voices of the Quince singers begins to follow a unique line, with detours into half-sung Sprechstimme and percussive sibilance. The other instruments don’t enter until about 7 1/2 minutes in, when the clarinet and brasses offer a chorale-like interlude, mournful and dignified.
The Requiem is primarily a showcase for the Quince singers. They follow that instrumental passage with repetitions of the word “listen,” in different ways: The score instructs one to exclaim, and the others to plead, chant on pitch and whisper. A bass drum resounds, signaling the start of a dirge that includes a duet of simultaneous yet lonely melodies from the clarinet and trombone. By the end, after sadly beautiful word painting with the “Kyrie eleison” text and a clarinet solo of upward runs, Bryan arrives at a finale that is less restful and resolved than a traditional Requiem’s, but more cyclical, closing with the “mmm” vocalise that started the piece.
Bryan talked more about the work and its inspirations in the interview. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Was this commission specifically for a Requiem, or was that your choice?
A: It actually goes back to when I met Quince. I was really taken not only with their music and their voices, but also how they talked about music and the things that they cared about. We bonded, and then a year after that — about four years ago — we were talking, and I told them I would like to write an a cappella Requiem.
I grew up in an Anglican church and was deciding between the Catholic Mass and the Anglican Mass, and thinking of writing a Requiem, but in my own style. As I got into it, I started reading about different dying rituals from traditions around the world, how people approach funerals and the celebration of life. Then I took a pause, because it got really big. There was a lot to learn, and it was changing the way I approached it — and because we didn’t have a specific deadline, I stepped down.
Later, I heard from Missy Mazzoli about a commission at the Chicago Symphony, and I knew that Quince was on the program. So I changed it. The first section is still a cappella, but then I added instruments.
Q: Even with more musicians, it’s still far from the scale of something like Verdi’s Requiem.
A: It was already going to be chamber size. But yeah, I ended up going kind of minimal with the way I used the instruments. I checked out classic Requiems, definitely Verdi’s and Mozart’s, and the feeling I got — or even just from reading the Catholic Mass — was this feeling of rising up against death. It feels like there’s a battle or a triumph, and I found that I was most interested in thinking about death and the cyclical nature of life and death, and more, kind of, an acceptance. So all my text was Christian, but it’s my perspective on the Requiem.
Q: I was about to say, there’s a tension at the end of your piece, between triumphant language like “Death will be no more” and music that’s more unsettled and mysterious.
A: It felt like a natural ending because it’s a life cycle; it wasn’t a triumph or an arrival point. And with the text, “The first things have passed away,” I thought it was something that was not an ending or a beginning.
Q: When you were exploring traditions of mourning, what did you find yourself attracted to, conceptually and artistically?
A: The one that hit home the most is just thinking about New Orleans — the idea of the celebration of life and the jazz funeral. There’s the walking of the casket from the church to the burial ground, but there’s a whole ceremony in a jazz funeral that starts with the dirge, and then it goes up-tempo to a celebration of life. So that was a major influence on the instruments that I chose: the brass band or the New Orleans ensemble. I wasn’t trying to replicate the style, necessarily, but there are little symbolic things.
Q: What do you make of the context of this Requiem’s premiere, as opposed to spring last year?
A: I know some commissions come in response to this historic thing, and you have your own take, but this was something that I just wanted to do. That’s why it’s interesting that it took its own time and that the actual premiere is after this really profound time of loss. I find these kinds of things mysterious, how they happen. So, I hear it differently. It sort of came out of some of the work I was already doing, where I was writing music about police brutality. I wouldn’t say this piece is about that; it was a chance for me to go in deeper into these ideas about life and death.
Quince asked, in the middle of the rougher parts of the pandemic, how I would feel if they just recorded the first, a cappella part and put it online for people — just something to share. The folks at the Chicago Symphony were very supportive of that, so we did. It felt good to have something like that to offer, and I feel the same way as it is being offered now. I hope it will be healing to people.

What Did New York’s Primaries Mean for Progressives? It’s Complicated.

NEW YORK — They may not win Gracie Mansion, but there’s always Buffalo. And Rochester, too.
For progressives in New York state, primary elections Tuesday night brought a number of victories, even as the biggest apple of them all — New York City’s mayoralty — may elude their grasp.
Although Eric Adams amassed a sizable lead over Maya Wiley, his top rival, in first-choice votes, liberal candidates celebrated victories in down-ballot races in New York City and in the state’s second- and third-largest cities, wins that they argue demonstrate their ascendancy at the grassroots level even as they are struggling to flex their power in Washington.
In perhaps the biggest upset of the night, India Walton, a democratic socialist, defeated a four-term incumbent in the Democratic mayoral primary in Buffalo and cast her victory as a threat to the longtime party establishment.
Walton had promised to safeguard immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, place a moratorium on new charter schools and cut millions from the Police Department budget by ending the role of officers in most mental health emergency calls.
“This victory is ours. It is the first of many,” said Walton. “If you are in an elected office right now, you are being put on notice. We are coming.”
As New Yorkers prepare to wait weeks for final results in the mayoral primary while absentee ballots are counted and ranked-choice tabulations begin, the early returns across the city and state paint a complicated picture. They highlight voters’ embrace of a diverse slate of candidates but reflect generational divides and continued tension as Democrats navigate their identity in the post-Trump era.
While the idiosyncratic politics of deeply Democratic New York City are hardly a bellwether for the nation, the results in the mayoral contest in particular point to a progressive movement still charting its way through the kinds of divisive policy issues that split the Democratic Party during last year’s presidential primary.
Three of the top four candidates in the election ran on more moderate messages than Wiley's, particularly around crime and policing, and were rewarded with support from a diverse coalition that spanned all five boroughs.
But the early news was brighter for progressives elsewhere. Candidates backed by the Working Families Party won City Council seats in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, won more than 70% of the vote in his primary. Brad Lander, a council member from Park Slope, is leading in the primary for city comptroller.
In the Democratic primary for Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg was ahead of Tali Farhadian Weinstein, who sank more than $8 million into her own campaign, infuriating liberals because of her spending and ties to Wall Street. Tiffany Cabán, who narrowly lost a race for Queens district attorney in 2019, is leading in a primary for a City Council seat. And Antonio Reynoso, a council member who represents Williamsburg and Bushwick and once cast himself as a “boombox for progressive values,” leads the contest for Brooklyn borough president.
In Washington, progressives have found their ambitions curtailed by a razor-thin margin in the Senate and a refusal by moderate Democrats to support eliminating the filibuster.
Voting rights legislation failed this week, prompting concerns from many on the left that President Joe Biden and his administration did not mount a fierce enough push for one of their top priorities. As groups of senators draft dueling infrastructure plans, some liberals worry that the administration will jettison proposals to fight climate change and support caregiving in favor of a compromise that can draw Republican support.
And, in recent weeks, liberal candidates have lost a number of competitive primary contests. In Virginia, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe defeated four rivals who ran to his left to capture the nomination. Six weeks earlier, Troy Carter, a Louisiana state senator, defeated a left-leaning rival in a special election for a congressional seat.
In New York, the need to count absentee ballots and a new ranked-choice voting system means the Democratic mayoral primary is unlikely to be called until mid-July. But Adams, a Black retired police captain and Brooklyn’s borough president, captured a strong lead in first-choice votes, winning every borough except Manhattan and showing particular strength in the Bronx and working-class Black neighborhoods in Brooklyn.
Adams built his campaign in opposition to the “defund the police movement,” denouncing his liberal rivals for adopting left-wing slogans that he said threatened the lives of “Black and brown babies” and were being pushed by “a lot of young white affluent people.”
“I’m not sure that I would necessarily chose New York City as my bellwether for the country, but there’s no doubt that Adams staked his race on a more moderate position,” said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. “There are certainly significant pockets of progressivism in metropolitan areas all over the country; it doesn’t necessarily mean that is the dominant political strain.”
As results were tabulated, progressives sought to cast their second-place position as a victory of sorts, one they argued demonstrated their strength in a crowded field.
Wiley, who trails Adams by about 75,000 votes, urged her supporters to “wait patiently,” arguing that she could pull out an upset victory as the counting continues.
In the final weeks of the campaign, she won the backing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., among other progressive leaders, and liberals largely united behind her candidacy.
“Progressives have coalesced around Maya Wiley as a candidate. And it is the coalescing that is the reason there is a progressive candidate in No. 2,” Wiley said, when asked by reporters to evaluate the performance of left-leaning candidates in the election.
Yet some argued that progressives, faced with several candidates competing for the left-wing mantle, had failed to unite early enough around a single candidate. As the campaigns of Scott Stringer and Dianne Morales collapsed, the Working Families Party and other left-leaning groups rescinded endorsements and followed Ocasio-Cortez to rally behind Wiley as early voting started.
“Maya managed to move a lot of voters in a relatively short period of time,” said Sochie Nnaemeka, the New York state director of the Working Families Party. “As we look to the final results in this mayor’s race, I think we feel, overall, there is real progressive ascendancy, and there’s a possibility to continue to elect more candidates with a clear anti-establishment, pro-working people viewpoint.”
Some aides and allies of his rivals argue that Adams evaded the kind of scrutiny that weakened candidates like Stringer, the city comptroller who stumbled after facing two allegations of sexual misconduct, and Andrew Yang. Others pointed to a deluge of super PAC spending, which largely benefited moderate candidates, including Adams.
But the strong lead Adams has in the race also renews questions about the progressive movement’s ability to connect with Black and brown voters, particularly older voters who are more conservative on social issues and policing.
Adams’ working-class background enabled him to connect in a way that was more challenging for Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio and prominent analyst on MSNBC, some progressive strategists say. Adams, who barely campaigned in Manhattan, cast himself as a messenger of working-class anger and frustration with the management of the city.
Rebecca Katz, a strategist who worked for Stringer, noted that parts of Ocasio-Cortez’s district had supported Adams, who takes a far more conservative position on the role of the police than the congresswoman.
“Voters are not ideological if you look at how they’re looking at their candidates,” she said. “You can’t look at these results and say it was a referendum on ideology. This is more a story of which candidates are connecting with voters.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

NYC’s Police Chokehold Ban Is Struck Down by Court

NEW YORK — In a victory for the city’s powerful police unions, a state Supreme Court judge struck down a city law banning police officers’ use of chokeholds and other physical restraints on Tuesday, saying the wording of the law was “unconstitutionally vague.”
The law, passed last summer, had been met with fierce resistance from police unions, who sued the city last fall over its passage. The language of the statute — which forbids officers from compressing a suspect’s diaphragm — was overly broad, the suit said, and made it nearly impossible for officers to physically engage suspects, even if the use of force was in good faith.
Justice Laurence Love agreed: “The phrase ‘compresses the diaphragm’ cannot be adequately defined as written,” he wrote in his ruling in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The judge encouraged the city to revise its law, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, at his daily news conference on Wednesday, urged lawmakers to move quickly to do so.
Hank Sheinkopf, a spokesman for the coalition of police unions that filed the suit, said that having such a vague standard hindered police officers from effectively doing their jobs. “That’s not only dangerous for cops — it’s bad for public safety,” he said. “This ruling makes clear that protecting the public and the ability of public safety civil servants to do their work are inseparable.”
The law had been part of a flurry of reforms that the City Council passed in the wake of widespread protests — including huge demonstrations in New York — following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last summer.
The use of chokeholds by police officers is already a felony crime under New York state law and is against New York Police Department policy. The City Council law forbade broader methods of restraint, saying any application of pressure to a person’s neck or kneeling on a person’s back or torso could be prosecuted as a misdemeanor.
Nearly since its inception, the language of the law was the subject of controversy. Even advocates for police reform said it might have been too broad and would be difficult to hold up in court.
Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said when the law passed that it would most likely be difficult to bring a case to court under the new statute. And the Staten Island district attorney, Michael McMahon, vowed not to prosecute officers who accidentally violated the law in the course of their jobs.
Facing criticism and a wave of shootings, some city lawmakers moved to revise the law last August, clarifying that the force had to be “recklessly” applied to be illegal, an effort that never made it to a vote.
Applauding the judge’s ruling on Tuesday, Edward Mullins, the head of the sergeant’s union, said in an email to members that it “sends a clear message to the City Council and the mayor that their anti-police policies will be challenged and defeated.”
But Love did not completely side with the unions. He rejected their arguments that the city law was preempted by the state’s chokehold ban, saying that the unions had failed to show that the city law banned conduct permitted under state law or that it interfered with state regulations.
In his ruling, Love acknowledged that the city and police department “have taken great pains to reduce the risks” of chokeholds by implementing new policies and training that restricts officers from sitting, kneeling or standing on the chest or back of a person under any circumstances.
“It is this court’s sincere hope that the New York City Council will revisit this issue to address this vital matter,” he said.
De Blasio said the best way to address the court’s concerns was to refine the law and pass an updated version quickly.
“The underlying concept of the law is to protect lives of people, to create fairness and justice,” he said. “We have to do that in the context, obviously, of also protecting public safety and making it clear that our officers need clear rules to do their jobs well.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

NEW YORK — The Tony Awards, long delayed by the pandemic, announced on Tuesday the first recipients, honoring the Broadway Advocacy Coalition, an organization started five years ago by a group of actors and others as a tool to work toward dismantling racism through theater and storytelling.
The other recipients were “David Byrne’s American Utopia,” an intricately choreographed concert by the Talking Heads singer, and “Freestyle Love Supreme,” a mostly improvised hip-hop musical that was created, in part, by Lin-Manuel Miranda. These honors, called special Tony Awards, were presented to three recipients that the Tony administration committee thought deserving of recognition even though they did not fall into any of the competition categories, according to a news release.
The recipients were announced more than one year after the ceremony had originally been expected to take place. During the coronavirus pandemic, the ceremony was put on indefinite hold. The awards show — a starry broadcast that will celebrate Broadway’s comeback — is now set to air on CBS in September, when Broadway shows are scheduled to return to theaters in almost full force. Most of the awards, however, will be given out just beforehand, during a ceremony that will be shown only on Paramount+, the ViacomCBS subscription streaming service.
The award for the Broadway Advocacy Coalition is indicative of how deeply the American theater industry was affected by the mass movement for racial justice set off by the police killing of George Floyd last year.
In a statement, Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, and Heather A. Hitchens, chief executive of the American Theater Wing — the two organizations that present the awards — said that the coalition has provided an “unparalleled platform for marginalized members of our theater community and tools to help us all do better as we strive for equity.”
Among the organization’s projects is Theater of Change, a social justice methodology — developed with Columbia Law School — that brings together Broadway artists, legal and policy experts and people whose lives have been shaped by forces such as the criminal justice, immigration and educational systems to collaborate on storytelling as a means to advocate “just policies.”
This year’s ceremony for the Tonys, formally known as the Antoinette Perry Awards, will be the 74th such event and will recognize work performed on Broadway between April 26, 2019, and Feb. 19, 2020.
Broadway’s 41 theaters have been closed since March 12, 2020; right now, the first planned performances are for “Springsteen on Broadway,” the rock legend’s autobiographical show, which is set to open this Saturday at the St. James Theater. As of now, the next show scheduled to open is “Pass Over,” a play about two Black men trapped on a street corner, on Aug. 4 at the August Wilson Theater.
“American Utopia,” which opened on Broadway in October of 2019, is planning to restart performances on Sept. 17. “Freestyle Love Supreme,” which opened that same month, is scheduled to play again for a live audience on Oct. 7. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

How an Anti-Corruption Bill Became a Showdown on Democracy

WASHINGTON — When House Democrats sat down to write an expansive elections and presidential ethics bill in 2019, passage was the farthest thing from their minds.
Democrats running for the House in Republican-leaning districts had campaigned on a poll-tested message of ending corruption in Donald Trump’s Washington, rooting out money from politics, and ending partisan gerrymandering, ideas that were popular across the political spectrum. Their newly elected speaker, Nancy Pelosi, wanted to enshrine those campaign pledges as the first bill of the new Democratic House, House Resolution 1 — a transformative measure, but with Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump in the White House, one that had no chance of becoming law.
By this year, circumstances had changed dramatically — after the effort by Trump and his supporters to overturn the results of the 2020 election and amid a rush by Republicans to enact a wave of state-level legislation impeding ballot access — but the bill had not.
What started out as a largely political document suddenly was being portrayed by Democrats as an imperative to preserve voting rights and a crucial test of democracy itself. And although Republicans in Congress made it clear they would oppose any bid to expand ballot access, Democratic leaders vowed to use their narrow majorities in the House and the Senate to try to push it through.
The failure of that strategy will become clear on Tuesday. With Republicans making good on their promise to block it, a first procedural vote in the Senate will leave the legislation far short of the 60 votes it needs to advance, dooming the bill and leaving Democrats with an issue to campaign on, but not the big legislative victory progressives had sought.
The story of how the bill reached this point is one of shifting political imperatives, practical challenges, legislative changes and, in the end, an entrenched Republican opposition.
“That is the work you would do when you get into reality,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the chair of the committee that tried to reshape the House bill into a more workable version. “Maybe it started as a wish list for people wanting to cement our democracy, but it evolved into the salvation for our democracy, and I don’t think that’s an overstatement.”
The blockade expected on Tuesday will preserve the status quo post-Trump, freezing action indefinitely in Washington as Republicans at the state level proceed largely unencumbered with new laws curtailing early and mail-in voting, while installing partisans to oversee and certify the next election.
And once again, intense public interest, after the Capitol riot of Jan. 6 and the focus on voting access ever since, will not be enough to carry the day, just as the massacre of school children at Sandy Hook Elementary School was not enough to secure 60 Senate votes on gun background checks in 2013.
“Authoritarianism thrives on doom and a sense among the majority of the people that they are powerless against the minority,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said as he warned against becoming demoralized. “We have to fight as hard as we can, but never accept the idea that our battles are unwinnable.”
The legislation did not start as a battle for the future of democracy, as Democrats frame it, or as the partisan power grab that Republicans call it. The initial driver was the ethical norm-breaking of Trump and his White House. Whistleblowers would be empowered. Presidents and vice presidents would be forced to release their tax returns. Businesses owned by the commander in chief would have to be sold, conflicts of interest disentangled, any profit motive for the presidency ended.
The legislation did contain prescriptions for early voting, mail-in balloting and other measures to ease access to the franchise, but Democrats emphasized an entirely different concern: the prospects of Russian meddling in future elections, either by surreptitiously influencing campaigns through undisclosed online advertisements or by the outright hacking of voting systems.
But as the Trump-centric concerns shifted from his conduct in office to his false claims of voter fraud on his way out — and then to Republican state legislative responses to his loss — the bill’s emphasis shifted, too.
For Klobuchar, the evolution was personal. Six days before the November election, a conservative panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a district court and decided that mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day could be ruled invalid. She rushed to every television station she could reach in Greater Minneapolis to plead with voters either to get their ballots in immediately or vote in person.
“For me, it was so visceral about how real it was,” she recalled. Others latched onto the decision in Texas to limit Harris County, which includes Houston, to a single ballot drop box, or the Supreme Court stepping in to require South Carolina absentee ballots to include a witness signature.
On Jan. 6, Democrats won control of Washington amid an insurrection. With the shattered Capitol on lockdown, a series of frantic conference calls followed, until Jan. 19, when the new majority leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, declared that HR 1 would be S 1 — the new Democratic Senate’s top priority. Klobuchar’s committee staff went to work on changes that she hoped would at least unite the Senate’s Democrats.
And the bill morphed into a showdown between two parties, both of which say the American experiment itself is at stake. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, called the bill an effort to “rig the rules of American elections permanently in the Democrats’ favor.”
Some supporters of action say Democrats made it far too easy for Republicans to oppose it, by assembling legislation that was breathtaking in its scope, transformative in its implications and very difficult to implement.
Senate Democrats made a long series of changes to try to address some of the nuts-and-bolts concerns, extending timelines and adding waivers for local governments trying to implement automatic voter registration and same-day registration, giving more latitude on early voting rules, and lowering the minimum required mail-in ballot drop boxes from 1 per every 20,000 voters to 1 per 45,000.
But it was never going to be enough.
“There is clearly a crisis in democracy at this moment,” said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the centrist Bipartisan Policy Center. “We wanted to build on that, and we’re going to get nothing because we bit off more than we could chew.”
The bill could be seen as four separate measures, each of which would have far-reaching implications on its own.
Its original driver was presidential ethics, powered by the conduct of Trump. The ethics section would mandate the release of presidential and vice presidential tax returns, bar a president and vice president from holding on to business interests and force new rules on conflicts of interest.
Another section, on campaign finance, would bring public financing of elections into congressional races, freeing candidates from the need for most fundraising while diminishing the power of big campaign donors.
Still another section would bar partisan state legislatures from redrawing House district lines to guarantee safe seats for one party or another.
The voting rights section would set a floor of 15 days for early voting, expand no-excuse mail-in voting, mandate drop boxes for mail-in ballots to bypass the Postal Service, and bar most laws that mandate photo identification for voters.
Democrats say none of the sections, on their own, would have gotten the 10 Republicans needed to break a filibuster, so combining them made sense because the issues all interlocked.
But some of those provisions turned out to be political gifts to Republican opponents. Sen. Angus King of Maine, a center-left independent, said he warned the Democrats he caucuses with that public financing of elections would invite Republicans to dust off an old charge that Democrats were pushing “welfare for politicians.”
As if on cue, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., chairman of the party’s Senate campaign arm, said last week: “Think about what the Democrats are doing — they’re taking a vote to give themselves money. They want to take your taxpayer dollars, and they give it back to themselves and manipulate the vote.”
The provision to roll back voter identification laws across the country went against public opinion. A Monmouth University poll released Monday showed broad support for in-person early voting, considerable division over expanded mail-in balloting — and 80% support for mandatory identification checks at the polls.
Such provisions gave Republicans added ammunition to rail against the entire effort.
“I just think it’s not a popular bill,” Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said last week.
McConnell said on Monday the shifting salesmanship of the bill was evidence that Democrats were just not being honest about it. The bill itself has not changed much since 2019, but the messaging has.
Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., a primary author of it, read that differently.
“It proves the point about why the legislation needs to be as comprehensive as it is, because at any given moment, there is one element of our democratic infrastructure that is in need of repair,” he said.
As Democrats pledged to fight on, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was somber. A Capitol Police officer had reminded him, he said, that after the Sept. 11 attacks, lawmakers joined together on the Capitol steps and pledged to respond — as Americans. The officer lamented the bitter partisanship over the coronavirus pandemic, then the failed response to the attack on the Capitol, when a filibuster brought down a proposed commission to investigate the riot.
“This is more than just a vote on an issue,” Kaine said Monday evening. “If Congress won’t act to protect the democracy, that sends a very powerful and dangerous signal.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

NEW YORK — New York City’s Law Department holds some of the city’s most closely guarded secrets: evidence of police misconduct, the identities of young children charged with serious crimes, plaintiffs’ medical records and personal data for thousands of city employees.
But all it took for a hacker to infiltrate the 1,000-lawyer agency’s network early this month was one worker’s pilfered email password, according to a city official briefed on the matter.
Officials have not said how the intruder obtained the worker’s credentials, nor have they determined the scope of the attack. But the hack was enabled by the Law Department’s failure to implement a basic safeguard, known as multifactor authentication, more than two years after the city began requiring it, according to four people with knowledge of the legal agency’s system and the incident.
The intrusion interrupted city lawyers, disrupted court proceedings and thrust some of the department’s legal affairs into disarray. And on Tuesday morning, in a conference call, Mayor Bill de Blasio admonished the heads of city agencies to shore up their cyberdefenses or face consequences in the event their agencies were hacked, according to three people who were on the call.
The mayor’s warning to the agency heads comes 10 days after the city’s Cyber Command, created by de Blasio in 2017 to defend the city’s computer networks, detected unusual activity on the Law Department’s computer system.
The next afternoon, June 6, city officials have said, they removed the department’s computers from the city’s larger network. Many remain disconnected.
De Blasio, in public appearances last week, said that the hack was under investigation by the New York City Police Department’s intelligence bureau and the FBI’s cyber task force. He said officials were not aware of a ransom demand being made or of any information being compromised.
Officials also said there was no evidence that the attack had damaged the city’s computer systems, though the investigation was still in an early stage. Investigators are still trying to determine the identity of the perpetrator and the motive.
“We’ve identified the malware — we have seen it before,” John Miller, the Police Department’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference.
“Is it someone looking to corral information, export it and then do a ransomware attack?” Miller said. “Is it another kind of actor looking to gather information for other strategic purposes?” Both were possibilities, Miller added.
A City Hall spokeswoman and a spokesman for the Law Department both declined to comment Thursday.
Multifactor authentication, a measure familiar to many who work on computers at home and at the office, requires users logging into sensitive accounts to take at least one additional step to verify their identities, like entering a temporary numerical code sent to a user’s cellphone.
The tool has been widely adopted in recent years, cybersecurity experts say, as hackers increasingly target government, business, hospitals and infrastructure using stolen passwords and other credentials. This allows them to penetrate computer systems to disrupt operations or steal data, which can be used to demand a ransom.
The vast majority of ransomware attacks taking over American towns, cities and hospitals were made possible because the targets failed to turn on multifactor authentication, cybersecurity experts and officials said. Hackers exploited the lack of multifactor authentication to force the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline in May and in an attempt to poison the water supply in a small Florida town in February 2020, officials have said.
Diligent hackers have found ways to bypass multifactor authentication on software used by the Pentagon and many Fortune 500 companies. But cybersecurity experts say its use is still one of the simplest ways to significantly reduce the odds of a successful attack.
In an urgent memo earlier this month, the White House urged American organizations to use multifactor authentication, in addition to other safeguards like backing up data.
A directive issued by New York’s Cyber Command in April 2019 required all city agencies to use multifactor authentication for access to restricted or sensitive information, according to a copy of the document obtained by The New York Times.
Geoff Brown, head of Cyber Command and New York’s chief information security officer, acknowledged at a news conference last week that the city had issued such a directive, but he refused to answer a question about whether the Law Department used the tool.
“At this time answering questions about the protection of city systems could give the attacker insight” into the city’s internet technology or the ongoing investigation, Brown said.
The Law Department’s servers ran on Microsoft software released in 2003, which the company stopped providing critical security updates for in 2015.
The failure to update software makes municipal systems a ripe target for hackers who simply scan the internet for unpatched software and exploit it. The Florida water treatment plant hacked last February also used a decade-old version of Microsoft Windows that had not been updated in years.
In his phone call Tuesday with city agency heads, de Blasio cited multifactor authentication and up-to-date software as priorities that needed to be addressed immediately, according to the officials who participated in the call.
Katharine Rosenfeld, a lawyer who in one case represented a pregnant woman who sued the city after being handcuffed while she was in labor, said the security lapses revealed the Law Department was “scarily sloppy” in its handling of confidential information.
“Think of all the medical records that we give them of our clients, mental health treatment, settlement negotiations,” Rosenfeld said. “It just makes me very worried.”
The disabling of the Law Department's computer system after the attack has had an impact that has rippled through New York courts, slowing cases and forcing city lawyers to ask for extensions on deadlines.
“While the undersigned has recently regained remote access to email,” one city attorney, James Jimenez, wrote to a Brooklyn federal judge on Tuesday in a false-arrest lawsuit, “I am still unable to remotely access any case files or documents.”
In federal court in Manhattan, the attack fueled a dispute in a set of high-profile lawsuits accusing the Police Department of using excessive force and making unjustified mass arrests during the demonstrations in New York last year after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
Plaintiffs’ lawyers have complained that the Law Department, citing the hack, has refused to say when it will turn over critical documents that the lawyers say they need to investigate what they have called the city’s “brutal response” to the large-scale protests.
The Law Department has accused the plaintiffs’ lawyers of using the hack to “engage in gamesmanship” and of suddenly deciding that “now is a good time to inundate defendants with a barrage” of new document requests, a city lawyer, Dara L. Weiss, wrote to the court last week.
Weiss said that despite the “technological challenges,” the hack had not halted progress in the case.
“Defense counsel have not been sitting on their hands,” Weiss added. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

50 Police Officers Step Down From a Crowd Control Unit in Portland

Full text: Enlarge this image.
A group of about 50 police officers who had served voluntarily on a specialized crowd control unit in Portland, Oregon, have stepped down from the squad after a year of sometimes violent clashes with protesters, the city’s Police Department said Thursday.
The resignations came just hours after a member of the unit, Officer Corey Budworth, was indicted on a misdemeanor assault charge that he physically injured an independent photojournalist during a protest in August.
Video of the episode shows an officer using his baton to shove a woman to the ground and then pushing the baton in her face as a voice declares in what sounds like an official announcement: “Officers are taking lawful action. Stay on the sidewalk.”
The officers’ union has denounced the indictment, calling it a “politically driven charging decision” against an officer who “worked to restore order during a chaotic night of burning and destruction in Portland.” Efforts to reach Budworth’s lawyer Thursday were not immediately successful.
On Wednesday night, just hours after the Multnomah County district attorney announced the indictment, the roughly 50 colleagues who had served with Budworth on the unit voted to leave the squad, known as the Rapid Response Team, Deputy Chief Chris Davis said Thursday. He said the officers would remain on regular patrol and could still be deployed to respond to protests.
The officers, he said, had complained not only about the indictment, but about what they viewed as a broader lack of support after more than 150 nights of sustained protests, fueled in part by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020.
“If you put a human being through what they were put through, that takes a toll,” Davis said. “They’re not feeling like that sacrifice that they have made, necessarily, has been understood very well, and that’s their perspective, and I have to honor their perspective.”
The mass resignation is similar to an episode in June 2020, when all 57 officers on the Buffalo Police Department’s Emergency Response Team, a special squad formed to respond to riots, resigned from the team in support of two team members who had been suspended after they were captured on video shoving a 75-year-old protester to the ground.
In February, a grand jury declined to indict the two officers who had been facing felony assault charges for shoving the man, Martin Gugino, who had sustained a serious head injury.
The Portland Police Association, the officers’ union, did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment about the resignations from the Rapid Response Team.
But lawyers for Teri Jacobs, the independent photojournalist who was named as the victim in the indictment against Budworth, said the resignations from the team demonstrate “the contempt its members feel for even the possibility that one of their colleagues is held accountable for his actions.”
“Portland Police officers need to understand that they are not above the law nor are their actions exempt from the protections the Constitution aims to provide to people against exactly these types of abuse by police,” the lawyers, Juan Chavez and Franz Bruggemeier, said in a statement.
“The refusal to acknowledge and address this wrongdoing goes to the heart of what’s wrong with Portland Police,” they said. “The failure of our city’s elected leaders to step in is an indictment of their role in this mess and their complicity in the violence and trauma committed” by the Portland Police Bureau.
In October, the president of the Portland Police Association, Daryl Turner, had called on Mayor Ted Wheeler and the city’s police chief, Chuck Lovell, to publicly support the members of the Rapid Response Team who he said were “exhausted and injured” and had been used as “political pawns.”
The Rapid Response Team members “do not volunteer to have Molotov cocktails, fireworks, explosives, rocks, bottles, urine, feces and other dangerous objects thrown at them,” Turner wrote in a letter. “Nor do they volunteer to have threats of rape, murder, and assaults on their families hurled at them.”
Turner said the officers had been caught between what he described as conflicting demands to “stand down” and to use force only when protests spun out of control.
“These officers find themselves in a no-win situation,” Turner wrote. “They can’t win because of the position others have put them in.”
The Portland Police have also been criticized for using excessive force against protesters.
The city’s police officers used force more than 6,000 times over a six-month period from May 2020 to November 2020, according to lawyers with the Department of Justice, which reviewed officers’ actions as part of a previous settlement agreement. The review found that the force sometimes deviated from policy; one officer justified firing a “less-lethal impact munition” at someone who had engaged in “furtive conversation” and then ran away.
The report recommended that the city implement additional crowd-control training for both the Rapid Response Team and another specialized squad, the Mobile Field Force.
In November, a city report found that a majority of Portland’s police officers had “not received any recent skills training in crowd management, de-escalation, procedural justice, crisis intervention, or other critical skills for preventing or minimizing the use of force.”
The charges against Budworth stemmed from a protest outside the Multnomah Building in Portland on Aug. 18, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said.
In a federal lawsuit filed against the city in September, Jacobs said an officer — whom she identified only as “Officer 37” because of the number that he wore on his helmet — had chased her as she tried to walk away and then hit and shoved her in her back with his baton, knocking her to the ground.
He then waited while Jacobs gathered her senses and “bashed her in the face with his baton,” according to the lawsuit.
“In this case, we allege that no legal justification existed for Officer Budworth’s deployment of force, and that the deployment of force was legally excessive under the circumstances,” Schmidt said in a statement.
The Portland Police Association defended Budworth’s actions, calling him a “decorated public servant” who had been “caught in the crossfire of agenda-driven city leaders and a politicized criminal justice system.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

JERUSALEM — A police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Palestinian man with autism was charged with manslaughter on Thursday, in a case that brought attention to the issue of police brutality.
The family of the 31-year-old victim, Eyad Hallaq, expressed frustration that the authorities did not indict the officer on a more severe charge.
Hallaq was shot last year on May 30 during his morning commute to a school for adults with disabilities in Jerusalem’s Old City. His death prompted comparisons to the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis days earlier. Hallaq’s picture has been raised at many demonstrations in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv over the past year.
Prosecutors filed the indictment after coming under criticism in recent weeks because they still had not charged anyone a year after the killing.
For decades, efforts to rein in violent officers and impose accountability for their actions in Israel have repeatedly failed. The majority of complaints of police violence are never investigated, according to Justice Ministry records. Those that are almost never lead to criminal charges or even disciplinary action.
Prosecutors have said that they face enormous obstacles in pursuing such cases, such as police officers who refuse to incriminate one another and judges who are sympathetic to officers. Many Palestinians don’t bother filing complaints, prosecutors say, because they have such little trust in the system.
The officer charged on Thursday, whose full name has not been released publicly, could face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.
A statement by the prosecutors accused him of taking “an unreasonable risk” by opening fire on Hallaq, who they said “performed no action that justified the shooting.”
Khairi Hallaq, the victim’s father, protested the manslaughter charge as too lenient, calling it “unjust” and “unacceptable.”
“I’m angry,” he said by telephone. “The officer purposefully killed my son. Why only a maximum of 12 years behind bars? That’s insufficient.”
Efrat Nahmani Bar, the charged officer’s lawyer, called Hallaq’s killing “a horrible tragedy.” But her client was “absolutely positive he was dealing with a terrorist who was endangering his life,” she said.
“He was not operating in a laboratory,” she added. “Everything happened very quickly in one of the most dangerous places in the country.”
Nahmani Bar also emphasized her client’s youth — he was 19 at the time — saying he had finished his basic training just a few weeks earlier.
Hallaq, who lived in small home with his mother, father and sister outside the Old City, aroused the suspicions of police officers on a Saturday morning when he exhibited unspecified “certain characteristics in his behavior,” leading them to fear he was a “terrorist,” according to the indictment.
When he did not obey the officers’ commands to stop, they ran after him. One of them, a commander who was to leave the force within days, shot twice at Hallaq’s legs while pursuing him but missed, the indictment said.
Hallaq turned into an enclosed area, according to witnesses, where he crouched in fear in a corner. Among those looking on was one of the teachers from his school.
The teacher, Warda Abu Hadid, has said that she yelled to the officers that Hallaq had a disability and posed no threat, but the indictment does not mention that.
When the officer now being charged arrived and spotted Hallaq in the corner, he shot him once in the abdomen, the indictment said. After that, his commander shouted at him to cease fire.
One of the officers then asked Hallaq, in Arabic, “Where is the gun?” the indictment said. When he did not answer, the officer asked the teacher the same question, to which she replied, “What gun?”
At that point, the officer who was charged fired a second shot at Hallaq, killing him, according to the indictment.
Nitzan Horowitz, a left-wing minister in the newly formed Israeli government, welcomed the decision to charge the officer, calling it “necessary to preserve our moral backbone.”
But Ayman Odeh, the leader of an alliance of three Arab-majority parties, blasted the decision, saying the “infuriating and contemptible” charge allows for the “murder of any Palestinian who does not look good in the eye of a police officer or soldier.”
Hallaq’s father said his wife was still struggling to cope with the loss of her son.
“People say as time passes, you are able to forget things that happened,” he said. “But for my wife, as time passes, she only remembers our son more.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

NEW YORK — Maya Wiley’s bid to become mayor of New York City is based largely on her promise to overhaul the Police Department, and she often highlights her one-year stint as head of the city’s police watchdog agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, as evidence of her commitment.
In particular, she focuses on the agency’s role in the 2019 firing of Daniel Pantaleo, the police officer whose chokehold led to Eric Garner’s death in 2014 — a flash point that became the impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement.
But a review of her time leading the agency paints a more complicated picture of her actions in that case and of her experience holding officers accountable. Her critics say that the board felt more beholden to City Hall during her tenure, and they charge that the agency’s management and performance suffered.
Wiley also faced criticism that she did not use her time at the board, where she was chair from mid-2016 to mid-2017, to pursue cases more aggressively.
In 2012, the agency recommended charges in about 70% of cases. The number declined steadily until 2016, when it was 12%. In 2017, it was 11%, according to agency reports.
In the same period, the agency was much more likely to recommend training and instruction for officers, one of the least serious forms of discipline. That recommendation was issued in 5% of cases in 2012 and 44% in 2016.
“The dramatic changes in CCRB recommendations over the last three years raise serious questions about the CCRB’s commitment to meaningful civilian oversight,” Christopher Dunn, then associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, wrote in a 2017 letter to Wiley.
Board leaders have said that they decided to seek lesser penalties in a bid to compel police officials to agree to impose discipline more often. Wiley added in an interview that the city had also expanded the array of disciplinary actions that could be recommended, allowing the review board to opt for less severe punishment.
“It’s not really surprising that you would see charges going down as you had more tools, recommendations for those things that are the less extreme versions of some of those cases,” she said.
Of all the cases that came before the review board, none was as highly charged or closely scrutinized as the death of Garner. It took five years for Pantaleo, who was never criminally charged in the case, to lose his job.
Wiley, on the campaign trail and in candidate debates, has referenced her role in the process that ended with the firing of Pantaleo, and recently released an ad entitled “Breathe,” a reference to Garner saying repeatedly, “I can’t breathe,” as officers tried to detain him.
In the ad, Wiley said it was “time the NYPD sees us as people who deserve to breathe.”
At the time of Garner’s death, Wiley was serving as counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio. As such, she was one of his top two legal advisers, along with Zachary W. Carter, de Blasio’s corporation counsel.
The de Blasio administration settled on a legal strategy of not pursuing its own administrative charges — a necessary prelude to firing a police officer — against Pantaleo, while the city deferred to the Staten Island district attorney and federal authorities, who were considering more severe criminal penalties.
Carter said in an interview that City Hall did not want to initiate an internal Police Department trial at the NYPD that might risk producing testimony that could muddy the state and federal cases.
The decision allowed Pantaleo to remain on the city payroll for five years as investigations by the district attorney’s office and the civil rights division of the Obama administration’s Department of Justice wound down with no criminal charges ever filed.
Carter defended the administration’s strategy and said that it was common procedure for local law enforcement agencies to defer to federal investigators.
He said that when he was U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York and prosecuting the Abner Louima police brutality case, he had similarly asked other authorities to suspend their investigations until he was done with his own. Justin Volpe, the officer who sodomized Louima, was not fired until the day that he pleaded guilty, Carter said.
Carter said that Wiley was a “conscientious lawyer” who understands that lawyers have to respect the law “when it favors you and when it doesn’t.”
Despite her role in the administration, Wiley has faulted de Blasio for the city’s handling of the Garner case. During a mayoral forum held by WPIX-TV last month, she said that had she been mayor, “Daniel Pantaleo would have already been off the force.”
But if she ever advised the mayor to more promptly fire Pantaleo while she was the mayor’s counsel, Wiley declined to say, citing attorney-client privilege.
Two people who were in meetings with the mayor and his executive staff about the Garner case could not recall an instance in which Wiley argued for swifter discipline, though she might have done so privately.
Anthonine Pierre, deputy director of the Brooklyn Movement Center, said that while Wiley worked to maintain relationships with police accountability organizers while leading the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Wiley was never “out of step with de Blasio.”
“When we look at the fact that it took five years for Pantaleo to be fired and part of that time was under her watch, I think a lot of people should be asking her questions about what that was about,” Pierre said. “We’re not looking for another mayor who is good on rhetoric and bad on accountability.”
Mina Malik, who was executive director for two years at the police review board until November 2016, accused Wiley of overstating her role in Pantaleo’s dismissal.
“Frankly, for Maya to take credit for bringing Pantaleo to justice is not accurate,” she said. “The investigation, chokehold findings and recommendations were made before Maya came on board.”
But other current and former agency board members defended Wiley, who has also taken credit for ensuring that the review board’s civilian prosecutors bring the administrative case, rather than the Police Department’s lawyers.
Angela Fernandez, a former CCRB commissioner whose tenure overlapped with Wiley, said that the Pantaleo prosecution was the highlight of Wiley’s leadership.
John Siegal, another CCRB commissioner, still remembers the day the police commissioner ratified an internal judge’s determination that Pantaleo should be fired.
“I called Maya, and I said, ‘Congratulations, you were the one official in American who utilized her official responsibilities to move this case,’” he recalled. “‘The attorney general didn’t do it. The Justice Department didn’t do it. Nobody else did it. You did it. And you are to be congratulated on that.’”
Wiley’s leadership also came under fire for allowing the board to make decisions out of public view — a criticism that echoed similar assessments of her work as counsel to de Blasio.
As counsel, Wiley argued that the mayor’s emails with a cadre of outside advisers did not have to be disclosed to the public because the advisers were acting as “agents of the city.” Thousands of pages of those emails were eventually released, to the mayor’s embarrassment.
Under her watch at the review board, questions of transparency arose when a highly anticipated report on the use of Taser stun guns was released in October 2016.
A draft report that had been leaked that spring said the police should prohibit the use of the stun guns on handcuffed subjects and highlighted that officers used the stun guns on people who were unarmed. But in the final version, released after the draft report had been circulated to City Hall and the Police Department, that language was absent — a change that officials said was part of the usual rewriting process.
In February 2017, Dunn sent another letter to Wiley asserting that “the board has ceased to engage in any meaningful public business.”
“In the 16 years I have been attending board meetings and monitoring the CCRB, I have never seen the board abandon its public responsibilities as it has in the last eight months,” he wrote.
In an interview, Wiley suggested that should a Garner-like tragedy arise on her watch as mayor, she would defer to the Biden administration before taking action herself, much as de Blasio deferred to the Obama administration.
“If for any reason, there was any indication that we were not going to get movement, then it would be a different story,” she said. “But look, we’ve got the A-Team in this Department of Justice on civil rights right now.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

With Healing in Mind, Stage Collaborators Take a Dip Together

Before everything that happened happened, playwright Lynn Nottage had a plan for wrapping up her three-show residency at Signature Theater. It would be the off-Broadway premiere of a new comedy — a play that was titled “Floyd’s” when it was first staged in Minneapolis in 2019.
But 2020 brought the pandemic and the theater shutdown; the killing of George Floyd and the challenge thrown down by the We See You, White American Theater movement. As the industry reopens, some are determined to restart from a healthier, more equitable place.
Nottage, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who didn’t get her first production on Broadway until 2017, is slated to be back there this fall with both “MJ the Musical” and “Clyde’s” — formerly known as “Floyd’s,” since renamed to take the pain-filled association away.
For her Signature residency, then, she did something quietly radical: She asked 17 other artists of color, most of whom had never worked there before, to share her slot for an immersive event called “The Watering Hole.” Starting Tuesday, it will guide small groups of visitors through a series of installations in the lobby, theaters and backstage spaces of the Pershing Square Signature Center. It is meant to be a welcome back to theater.
“That moment in which we first cross the threshold is going to really tell us a lot about how things have changed over the course of the year,” Nottage said. “There’s been so much lip service paid to equity and inclusion. But the real test is in the pudding. So we wanted to create a space that felt welcoming and felt inclusive and that felt safe. And that really meant sort of disrupting the notion of what a theater looks like.”
For “The Watering Hole,” that entails in part a different kind of storytelling than what the playwright-centric Signature and its audiences are accustomed to. Collaboratively devised, design-forward, highly varied works that Nottage likened to amuse-bouches, some are narrative in form, while others are more meditative. One of the 10, in some dressing rooms, asks people to participate karaoke-style.
After more than a year in which human bodies have been at the center of so much cultural discourse — because of the coronavirus, and Black Lives Matter, and attacks on people for their race or gender, or both — “The Watering Hole” is about inviting many kinds of bodies safely into a physical environment.
Made by people who have not always felt welcome as artists or audience members, it is about who gets to occupy space in the theater, and whose comfort and catharsis are attended to.
The Signature lobby is one of the great theater lobbies of New York. In ordinary times, it’s open all day — a slightly out-of-the-way spot on far West 42nd Street where theater people work and socialize. Its popularity is one reason the show is called “The Watering Hole.” On a recent Sunday afternoon, though, its couches and tables and chairs were nowhere to be seen.
But sculptor Vanessa German and playwright Haruna Lee were there, building their installation. In keeping with the water theme that runs through the show, it will include three boats, a river goddess and video screens showing Lee’s mother, Aoi Lee, performing Butoh dance.
Last year, the pandemic ended an encore run in New York of Haruna Lee’s play, “Suicide Forest,” in which both Lees performed.
“How hopeful and abundant that we got to continue — I feel like I’m going to cry — that we got to continue creating together in this way,” Haruna Lee said. “Because when our show was shut down, it felt like that was it. That’s the end of our two-year collaboration together. And here we’ve found a way to keep going.”
Lee and German are gentle souls, and as they spoke of the fraught year they have had, they were tender with each other — German remembering the time they were on the phone as police chased someone up her alleyway in Pittsburgh, and that after the killings of Asian women in Atlanta she made Lee a T-shirt that said, “i am grieving,” and below, emphatically: “LEAVE ME ALONE!”
There was tenderness, too, in the way they were thinking about audience members entering the lobby space, not knowing what to expect of “The Watering Hole,” or a piece like theirs that is part prayer and part poetry.
“I wonder if people will wonder if they’re doing it right,” German said, softly. “I wonder if there’s a way we can say, ‘You’re doing it right. You’re here. You’re here, you’re here, you’re here. And that’s what’s right.’”
For another installation, sound designer Justin Ellington and playwright Christina Anderson are creating a series of what they call “sound baths” for the venue’s biggest stage, experimenting with aural frequencies and chakra points.
The title of the overall project reminds Ellington of nature shows he watched as a child.
“There was always a watering hole scene,” he said. “And, you know, without the lion or the alligator being present, it was really a meeting place for all these animals that did not speak the same language to go get something from a source. They all needed this. And that’s the stage to me. I need this.”
Which does not mean, he noted, that the theater has always been a safe space for people of color.
“The We See You movement kind of acknowledges that there has been a lion or a tiger or something preventing comfort at all of these different watering holes,” he said. “A lot of people in our industry have to drink, have to eat, have to pay rent, you know, and will go into a lot of situations where there’s fear and there is abuse and no joy.”
The energy in “The Watering Hole,” he said, “is like the medicine for that.”
It was only in mid-March that Nottage and her director and co-conceiver, Miranda Haymon, initially brought their collaborators together online — a much shorter development process than most off-Broadway shows. By necessity, the project has evolved somewhat on the fly.
To Paige Evans, Signature’s artistic director, it is all “a grand experiment.”
“It’s highly collaborative, highly multidisciplinary. And it’s devised theater,” she said. “And so that’s a very different approach for everyone.”
But, she noted, Signature lately has embraced artists, like the composer Dave Malloy and the ensemble the Mad Ones, whose work doesn’t fit its usual model. “The Watering Hole” belongs to that same trajectory, she said.
Haymon, who uses the pronoun they, said the project has pushed against traditional production rigidities in favor of a more organic approach.
“Part of the deep collaboration with the Signature,” they said, two weeks before the first audiences were due to arrive, “is that we really had to say, ‘Sorry, we know A, B and C about this piece, but we do not know T through Z. Is that enough?’ Then they’d say, ‘Can you at least tell us D, E, F?’ And we’d say, ‘OK, OK, OK, we can tell you D and E, maybe F.’
“I mean, dude, to be totally honest, there’s still Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z that we do not know.”
What is universal about the process is the teaming up of people who are new to one another yet have to bond fast to get the work done — what the playwright-performer Ryan J. Haddad called the experience of “Hello, I love you, we just met” that is intrinsic to theater making.
Haddad, who has cerebral palsy, is using his installation with the scenic and production designer Emmie Finckel to tell a story about the freedom and fear he experiences when he swims: the mobility that water allows him, the danger that it poses.
So on a hot, sunny day last month, Haddad, Finckel and their collaborators went to a backyard pool they had rented on Long Island to shoot video of Haddad swimming.
“I had not swum in a year,” he said. “And every single time, it’s sort of a slow entry. Am I going to make it all the way across? ”
It was his idea to get in the water by himself and to swim alone as his colleagues took a wide shot. But he’d done maybe two laps, he said, before he got scared and asked the others to get in with him. Haddad said his mind “needed the peace of knowing” that they were there. They got in, and all was well.
It is a short leap from that story to a metaphor: that in the theater, not everyone has been invited into the pool.
As the industry reopens, “The Watering Hole” is an effort to help change that — and in doing so, to create a safer, more buoying place. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Most Americans Know Little or Nothing About Juneteenth, Poll Finds

More than 60% of Americans know “nothing at all” or only “a little bit” about Juneteenth, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery in the United States, according to a new Gallup survey.
The 37% of respondents who reported having “a lot” or “some” knowledge of the holiday may be an increase from previous years, pollsters and academics believe, reflecting growing awareness after last summer’s protests against racism and police brutality.
The survey, the results of which were released on Tuesday, found that nearly half supported teaching the history of Juneteenth in public schools. There was less support — 35% — for making June 19 a federal holiday, but only a quarter of respondents said they were opposed to the idea.
On Tuesday, the Senate unanimously approved a bill that would make Juneteenth a legal public holiday. The House passed the bill, by a vote of 415-14, the next day.
Also known as Emancipation Day, Black Independence Day or Jubilee Day, Juneteenth celebrates the day in 1865 when Gordon Granger, a Union general, informed enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, that the Civil War had ended and that they were free.
The poll is the first Gallup has conducted about Juneteenth. It was organized by the Gallup Center on Black Voices as part a continuing effort to understand the public perception of and support for the broader inclusion of Black history in American history a year after a deep racial reckoning in the country, Camille Lloyd, the center’s director, said.
The study, which was conducted from May 18 to May 23 on a random sample of 3,572 adults who self-administered web surveys, found that results slanted around race and age. Sixty-nine percent of Black respondents said they had a lot or some knowledge of Juneteenth compared with 31% of white respondents. Younger adults were also more likely to know about Juneteenth than older adults.
The margin of sampling error for a sample of this size is plus or minus two percentage points, according to Gallup.
Reading between the numbers, the Gallup Center on Black Voices found that “awareness is a critical piece” in whether a person is supportive of celebrating and teaching Juneteenth, and the focus should be on maintaining and cultivating that awareness, Lloyd said.
Juneteenth has been celebrated by African Americans since the 19th century, and its broader popularity has waxed and waned throughout American history, according to Brenda Elaine Stevenson, a historian specializing in African American history and the history of the Southern United States.
“We see spikes in Juneteenth popularity at the same time we see focus on Black life and the position of Black people in American society,” Stevenson said.
She said that in addition to last summer’s protests, the pandemic’s disproportionate effect on Black Americans and the recent combative debates on the study of race in public schools and universities had contributed to a broader interest not only in learning about the experience of African Americans, but in finding ways to celebrate it as well.
“Juneteenth has now had a rebirth in terms of people focusing on it, celebrating it, wanting to know what it is and wanting to know what it signifies and how it relates to this long arc of racial divide and progress, or not, in our country,” Stevenson said.
Conversations about Juneteenth have also become important as the country reckons with how to commemorate its history, said Alaina Morgan, an assistant professor of history at the University of Southern California.
During protests last summer, over 160 Confederate symbols were removed from public spaces or renamed after the death of George Floyd, more than in any other year.
“It’s incumbent on our representatives to push this idea of the commemoration because it really stands for the freedom of all Americans,” Morgan said. What a holiday says is “that this is something that we care about as a people and as a nation and we want to take a moment to stop and have a day of reflection.”
In a statement after the passage of the Senate bill, Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, called the vote to make Juneteenth a federal holiday “a major step forward in recognizing the wrongs of the past.”
“But we must continue to work to ensure equal justice and fulfill the promise of the Emancipation Proclamation and our Constitution,” he added. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

NEW YORK — One week until the end of a bitterly contested mayoral primary, and a day before the race’s final debate, Kathryn Garcia and Maya Wiley both tried Tuesday to establish themselves as voters’ best alternative to the race’s apparent leader, Eric Adams.
“I’ve been a public servant, and that means that I have been serving the people of New York City,” Garcia, a former sanitation commissioner, said in an interview at noon at her campaign office in Brooklyn. “And that’s what we need right now, not a politician who has curried favors.”
“New York wants a different kind of leadership,” Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, said in front of the Brooklyn Public Library’s central location an hour later. “No tinkering around the edges of problems that we have failed to solve, but actually stepping up and being bold and transformational.”
The messages echoed the pitches the two candidates, both seeking to be the first woman elected mayor of New York, have been making to voters for months. But they have taken on a new urgency as time to court supporters is running out and polls show more city residents coalescing around Adams, the Brooklyn borough president.
A poll released Monday by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion found that Adams had the support of 24% of likely primary voters. Behind him, nearly neck and neck, were Garcia, at 17%, and Wiley, at 15%. (The poll had a margin of error of 3.8%.)
At a campaign event, Adams exhibited the confidence of a front-runner heading into the final stretch.
“The more New Yorkers hear my story and my vision, they just seem to like me,” he said, speaking at a rally with Mexican American leaders in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood.
But that same survey that showed strength for Adams also reflected gains for Garcia, whose campaign has surged after major newspaper endorsements, and for Wiley, who has endeavored to consolidate support from left-leaning voters as other candidates have stumbled.
It also showed some overlap in their bases: Among the voters who ranked Garcia as their first choice, Wiley was the most common second-choice pick. For Wiley’s supporters, the most popular No. 2 was Garcia.
Yet for weeks, as both candidates have tried to chip away at their rivals’ bases, they have largely stayed away from attacking — or even mentioning — each other.
They have also refrained from making statements of outright support for each other, even in an election using a ranked-choice system where being a voter’s second choice could theoretically help a candidate win.
As the campaign enters its final stretch, Garcia, one of the more moderate candidates in the primary field, has sought to woo voters across the broad political spectrum of New York’s Democrats.
At times, she has seemed to try to thread the needle between progressive voters and centrist ones on a range of issues, particularly public safety.
On Monday in lower Manhattan, she told progressive voters — one of whom complained that she “comes across as a defender of the police” — that she would rein in police brutality and, if necessary, fire defiant police officials.
That afternoon, in southern Brooklyn, she took a slightly different tone with small-business owners clamoring for more police officers on patrol. “I’ve been very clear,” she said “Everyone needs to be safe and secure, regardless of where they live or the color of their skin. I lived through the ’70s and ’80s in New York, and I don’t want to go back.”
On Tuesday, Garcia sought to frame her pragmatic approach to city government — one that focuses on day-to-day operations over ideology — as a left-leaning stance. When asked about her stance on climate change, she said that “there is literally nothing more progressive than getting it done, the really hard work.”
She has frequently made personal appeals to voters through canvassing or small events. On Tuesday, she held a round-table discussion with young people about how to improve the city’s foster care system.
The issue is far from the center of the mayoral campaign, but it gave Garcia — who was adopted and whose sister was in foster care for seven years — a chance to connect with voters on an emotional level while highlighting her desire to cut through entrenched bureaucratic tangles.
“This is a very personal issue,” Garcia said. “But also, this is the type of thing where we know it’s not working. And there’s another way of thinking about it that works so much better.”
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Wiley was again trying to unite progressives behind her, announcing a mutual endorsement with Crystal Hudson, a City Council candidate in central Brooklyn who is seeking to be the first out gay Black woman on the council.
“There is a real choice for New Yorkers on the ballot,” Wiley said. “We, in an historic crisis, have historic choices. And one of them is to make history by, in fact, voting for the most qualified to lead, in a historic crisis.”
Wiley focused on affordable housing, which has been a major issue in Hudson’s race. She reaffirmed her commitment to spending $2 billion to repair and expand public housing and to expanding housing subsidies to cover more New Yorkers.
“This isn’t a crisis,” Wiley said of the city’s housing crunch. “This is an impending catastrophe.”
Wiley also dismissed earlier comments by Garcia, who has sought to frame the race as a two-person contest between Adams and herself.
But she did not explicitly criticize either Garcia or Adams, saying instead that she was focusing on New Yorkers’ desire for a “different kind of leadership.”
Although Wiley and Garcia have both cast their ballots, neither has divulged her rankings.
Of the top five mayoral candidates, only Andrew Yang, whose support has slipped in recent weeks, has been willing to name his second choice: Garcia.
On Tuesday, Yang, who came in fourth in the Marist poll, reiterated that support, responding to a question about whether he would serve in a Garcia administration by saying, “I’d be excited to work with Kathryn in any capacity.”
Yang sounded upbeat while speaking to voters in Kew Gardens in Queens. He said he was looking forward to Wednesday’s debate, where he planned to focus on public safety, an issue that has dominated the last month of the race.
Adams, for his part, appeared to dismiss the value of the ranked-choice voting system, calling the process “complicated” and asserting that the city’s Board of Elections had failed to properly inform residents about it.
“You go to the average inner-city New Yorker, and you say, ‘What is ranked-choice voting?’ And they have no idea,” Adams said at his rally. “I’m concerned about that, but I want people to rank their candidates based on their choice, but the first thing I want them to rank is Eric Adams as their No. 1.”
Supporters of ranked-choice voting say that it gives voters more sway in a race’s overall outcome by allowing them to back a top pick but still voice their opinions on other candidates in the race.
Lurie Daniel Favors, the interim executive director of the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College, criticized Adams’ comments, likening them to efforts around the country to question the integrity of elections.
“Ranked-choice voting has the potential to give Black voters more power at the ballot box by allowing them to select and rank candidates that address their concerns in order of preference,” Favors said. “Any attempts to frame ranked-choice voting as too complicated or to discourage voters from fully exercising their rights to vote are wrong and harmful to our community.”

Quinta Brunson’s Viral Fame Knows No Bounds

When she began drafting her first collection of essays, Quinta Brunson wasn’t sure she had anything meaningful to say.
The comedian and actress spent years providing the internet with viral videos and memes that did most of the talking for her and inspired people online to express themselves using her image.
What she found most difficult while writing the book, she said, was getting personal.
“I would come back to it and try my hardest to turn sentences in my life into paragraphs, and then turn those paragraphs into chapters,” Brunson said. As a comedian, she added, “you turn things that happened to you into one-liners, into something to get a joke. But a book requires you to undo all the one-liners.”
For nearly a decade, people have grown accustomed to seeing Brunson, who is 31, do stand-up or appear in sketches online, including in what is arguably her most famous series, “The Girl Who’s Never Been on a Nice Date.”
The expressive way she contorts her face in these videos to emphasize her shock as she marvels over the splendors of a “fancy” date drove her to meme status. The laughs come from her awed reaction to completely mundane treatment from her date, like taking her to a restaurant with really good water or buying more than one snack at a movie theater. There are moments when she recognizes his flaws, but she dismisses them because, unlike other men, he’s not broke. Her catchphrase, “He got money,” became an aspirational brag that was shared, retweeted and repeated more than 1 million times online.
Now, with “She Memes Well,” which Houghton Mifflin Harcourt will publish Tuesday, Brunson breaks down her journey from struggling stand-up comedian to being recognized by strangers all over the world. The book includes hilarious anecdotes about growing up in West Philadelphia, being a Black woman, dating and life after internet fame.
She also gives serious thought to the evolution of memes and how they have emerged as a powerful tool to help people communicate and organize online. Memes mostly succeed as comedic relief, but Brunson thinks they deserve more respect than they receive.
“It’s Earth Day today,” she said during an interview in April, “and I shared nothing but memes on my page about climate change and about how corporations are honestly taking part in ruining the earth. What I love about the memes I shared is that it’s an easy translation for a very big topic that hopefully will make people look further into the issue.”
Brunson credits the memoirs of other actors and comedians, like Gabrielle Union, Mindy Kaling and Tina Fey, as inspirations for her book.
“Those books hugged me at times when I needed the hug,” she said. “I want my book to hug a younger Black girl who might be me.”
Growing up in Philadelphia, Brunson was the youngest of five in a close-knit family. She knew from the age of 5 that she wanted to become a performer, but she kept it a secret from her parents for most of her adolescent years and decided that studying advertising at Temple University was something they could get behind.
Eventually, she dropped out of school, got a job at an Apple store making “a whopping $13 an hour” and later moved to Los Angeles, juggling different hustles until landing her big break.
Her mother, Norma Brunson, was initially disappointed in her daughter’s decision to leave school but eventually came to grips with it.
“I reflected on my own youth and how I made decisions that may not have necessarily made my parents happy,” Norma Brunson said. “She always had this strong determination to do certain things and is trying to figure it out. And being the youngest of five, I think she just took a little bit of everybody’s personality and came up with this ‘Quinta’ person.”
Quinta, whose name means “fifth” in Spanish, arrived unexpectedly, she writes in her book, and she was told that her presence was a “treat” that strengthened her parents’ marriage, which was strained over the years.
“She’s always been extremely observant and very expressive at the same time, so I just accepted that part of her personality,” Norma Brunson said. “She’s always been a delightful person. She always brought a lot of joy in our household.”
“She Memes Well” was written during a transitional period for Brunson. When she began writing it, roughly three years ago, she was single and working at BuzzFeed Video (a job she affectionately calls her “9 to 5”), where she performed in a variety of parodies and sketches, a format that dominated the web at the time.
Such videos have declined in popularity as internet users have turned toward apps like TikTok and Instagram for similar content, but Brunson’s career has flourished in more traditional ways.
She’s been featured in a number of TV shows; played a lead role in the first season of HBO’s “A Black Lady Sketch Show,” which was nominated for three Emmys in 2020; and will produce and star in “Abbott Elementary,” a workplace comedy about Philadelphia teachers that’s currently in development at ABC.
In April, Brunson got her first pedicure in more than a year and beamed on a video call about how the treatment felt like “a vacation” after months spent stuck inside her home in Los Angeles with her fiance playing Mario Kart video games and drinking more than she’d like to.
Despite being physically isolated and focusing most of her time on family, her small bubble of friends and infrequent trips to Palm Springs to “see some different walls at an Airbnb,” she has been keenly tuned in to the larger world. She wrestled emotionally with the Derek Chauvin verdict in the killing of George Floyd and with the death of Ma’Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old Black girl from Columbus, Ohio, who was shot and killed by a police officer on the same day. We spoke two days after both events.
“I’m reeling with the reality of the news,” Brunson said, “but at the same time, trying to balance that with the good things going on in my life and trying to find space for both of those emotions.”
Kate Napolitano, the editor who acquired “She Memes Well,” said she first discovered Brunson’s work through the “Nice Date” video series in 2014. Napolitano, now an executive editor at Dey Street Books, said that when she saw the proposal for an essay collection in 2017, it felt like the perfect moment for the comedian “to explore a different side of her creativity.”
“We had always planned for a blend of serious essays among more lighthearted ones,” Napolitano said, “but after the death of George Floyd and the subsequent wave of protests around the country, Quinta was determined to channel the urgency of that moment.”
In her memoir, Brunson writes about losing her 17-year-old cousin to gun violence a few years ago and touches on how it felt to write a book during lockdown and widespread protests against police brutality.
“Do I feel like these things continue to happen without radical change? Yes,” Brunson said. “What are we going to do? And I think that’s a tough question for America and Americans, because it’s going to force us to reckon with some truths that we do not want to confront.”
There are tonal shifts in “She Memes Well” as Brunson ranges from lists detailing her favorite pieces of pop culture to essays about self-acceptance and mental health. What’s constant is her relationship with comedy and how she’s embracing the ways it has changed for her.
“I’m loving comedy, and comedy is loving me back,” she said. “Maybe I’m not moving as fast as some other people, but I don’t want to move fast. I want to move comfortably. And I feel that’s what I’m able to do now.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: The annual awards recognized journalism on the murder of George Floyd, including a special citation for Darnella Frazier, the teenager who filmed the killing. The public service prize went to The New York Times for Covid coverage.
Pulitzer Prizes were awarded on Friday to news organizations that provided in-depth coverage of the dramatic turns of 2020, a year dominated by a pandemic that left millions dead and a national conversation on race after the murder of George Floyd.
The prize for public service, considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers, went to The New York Times for its data-heavy coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, an award shared by many departments at the newspaper. The board called The Times's coverage "courageous, prescient and sweeping."
The Pulitzer board also recognized journalism that examined law enforcement practices during a year of worldwide street protests inspired, in part, by the murder of Mr. Floyd, a Black man, by a police officer in Minneapolis.
The award for national reporting recognized an investigative series on police dogs used as weapons, often against innocent citizens, a collaborative venture by four news organizations: The Marshall Project, a nonprofit outlet focused on criminal justice; AL.com, an Alabama news site; IndyStar, of Indianapolis; and the Invisible Institute, a journalism company based on the South Side of Chicago.
The Tampa Bay Times won the local reporting award for exposing a data-driven policing initiative in Pasco County, Fla., that intimidated residents and labeled some schoolchildren future criminals. The staff of The Star Tribune in Minneapolis won in the breaking news category for its coverage of the murder of Mr. Floyd and its aftermath, and 10 photographers from The Associated Press were honored in the breaking news photography category for their coverage of the nationwide protests touched off by his death.
The Pulitzer Prizes, first given in 1917 and presented annually by Columbia University for excellence in journalism, books, music and drama, were announced via video livestream by the Pulitzer board co-chairs Mindy Marqués González and Stephen Engelberg. Originally scheduled for April, the event was postponed as the pandemic lasted into 2021, giving board members more time to judge the entries.
The board leaders noted that journalists encountered "unparalleled challenges" last year as they worked remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, and sometimes faced the threat of arrest or injury while covering street protests.
Darnella Frazier, the teenager who filmed the murder of Mr. Floyd, received a special citation. In her remarks on Friday, Ms. Marqués González called Ms. Frazier's video "transformative," adding that it "jolted viewers and spurred protests against police brutality around the world."
BuzzFeed News won its first Pulitzer, in the international reporting category, for its investigative series on the scale of China's internment of Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim minority. Mark Schoofs, the BuzzFeed News editor in chief, said in a statement that the articles in the series "shine desperately needed light on one of the worst human rights abuses of our time."
Another first-time winner was The Atlantic, which was awarded the Pulitzer in the explanatory reporting category for coverage of the pandemic by Ed Yong. A second explanatory reporting prize was given to five Reuters journalists for an examination of a Supreme Court protection that shields police officers who use excessive force.
In the features article category, the board recognized two writers: Mitchell S. Jackson, a freelancer, who wrote for Runner's World about the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was murdered while jogging in Georgia; and Nadja Drost, also a freelancer, who wrote for The California Sunday Magazine on a group of migrants crossing the Darién Gap at the border of Colombia and Panama as they tried to make their way on foot to the United States. (The California Sunday Magazine suspended publication in October after its backer, Emerson Collective, an organization founded by the billionaire investor Laurene Powell Jobs, severed ties with its parent company.)
For books, in the category of general nonfiction, the winner was David Zucchino for "Wilmington's Lie: The Murderous Coup of 1898 and the Rise of White Supremacy," a deep study of a coup against the multiracial government in the coastal North Carolina city. Mr. Zucchino, a contributing writer for The Times, won a Pulitzer in 1989 for his reporting from South Africa.
Marcia Chatelain won the award in history for "Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America," on the relationship between McDonald's and Black communities. Louise Erdrich won in the fiction category, for the novel "The Night Watchman"; Natalie Diaz in poetry, with "Postcolonial Love Poem"; and Les Payne and Tamara Payne in biography for "The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X."
In addition to its public service Pulitzer on Friday, The Times won for criticism, an honor that went to Wesley Morris, a critic-at-large who writes on a wide range of topics, often with an emphasis on contributions by Black artists to American culture. His 2020 work included a meditation on the important role played by Black Americans with camera phones in the civil rights movement. It was the second Pulitzer for Mr. Morris, who won in the same category for his essays at The Boston Globe in 2012.
The public service Pulitzer honored contributions from several departments at The Times, including national, science, international, Washington, investigations, business, graphics, video, live briefings and audio. The board cited not only news articles that chronicled the pandemic's deadly progress, but the graphics department's virus case tracker, a video capturing 72 hours inside a New York hospital and an episode of "The Daily" podcast.
Among the coverage cited was a Feb. 2, 2020, article by the science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr., which sounded an early alarm about the Covid-19 virus. Mr. McNeil, a veteran of The Times, left the newspaper earlier this year after he was criticized for repeating a racial slur during a discussion of the word while he was taking part in a Times-sponsored student trip to Peru in 2019.
The Times marked its wins by assembling a group of staff members in the paper's newsroom, which has been largely empty since last March, when the great majority of Times employees started working remotely. Dean Baquet, the executive editor, noted that "literally hundreds of people had a hand" in the pandemic coverage. "You did something historic and large here," he said in his remarks, "something that will stay with you forever, I hope."
Emilio Morenatti of The Associated Press was awarded the feature photography prize for a series on the pandemic's impact on older people in Spain. The Pulitzer for audio reporting, in the second year of that category, was awarded to four National Public Radio reporters for the podcast, "No Compromise," an examination of guns in America.
The commentary prize went to Michael Paul Williams of The Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia for his columns on the removal of Confederate monuments around the city. The Pulitzer board called his work "penetrating and historically insightful." The Los Angeles Times's Robert Greene won the editorial writing award for a series on criminal justice reform.

Departures of Police Officers Accelerated During a Year of Protests

Police departments face severe challenges in retaining and recruiting officers, according to new data outlining the steady exodus from an occupation that was the target of protests last year after several high-profile police killings.
“We have lost about one-third of our staff to resignation and retirement,” said Chief David Zack of the Asheville Police Department in North Carolina — more than 80 officers out of a full complement of 238. “Certainly with the way that police have been portrayed and vilified in some cases, they have decided that it is not the life for them.”
Those reductions in Ashville echo a nationwide trend. A survey of about 200 police departments indicates that retirements were up by 45% and resignations by 18% in the period from April 2020 through March, when compared with the preceding 12 months. The percentage of officers who left tended to be larger for departments in big or medium-size cities, according to the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington policy institute that will release full data next week.
“It is an evolving crisis,” said Chuck Wexler, the organization’s executive director.
Last year’s departures came against the backdrop of protests that erupted nationwide when George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, along with the police killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta. The aggressive tactics some officers used against protesters often compounded the vitriol against the police.
The future of policing was called into question, with demands to defund departments or to assign some of their tasks to civilian agencies. The coronavirus pandemic also took a toll, with cities slashing budgets and some officers deciding that risking their health through potential exposure to the virus was endangering their families. The pandemic also brought a surge in the most violent crimes.
“It is an extremely difficult time to be a police officer,” said Maria Haberfeld, a professor of political science who trains police officers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
Cities where demonstrations were robust last year experienced substantial departures from their police forces.
In New York, 2,600 officers retired in 2020, according to police statistics, after 1,509 retirements the year before. In Portland, Oregon, 69 officers resigned and 75 retired from April 2020 through March, compared with 27 and 14 the previous year. In Seattle, resignations increased to 123 from 34 and retirements to 96 from 43.
Seattle ended up with 150 fewer patrol officers than expected, and for months, only slightly more than half of the highest-priority 911 calls have drawn responses within the targeted time of 7 minutes, according to police statistics.
Many cities are also finding it harder to attract recruits, with the number of new hires in Portland falling to 30 from 69 and in Seattle to 44 from 119.
After skipping any police training last year for budgetary reasons, St. Paul, Minnesota, received 178 applications this year, down about half from the 366 received in 2016, said Sgt. Natalie Davis, a police spokeswoman.
While the city is authorized to have 620 police officers, it has about 580 at the moment. That means the department has moved officers onto patrol duties from specialized units such as those that track drugs, gangs and guns, Davis said.
There is widespread consensus that another reason retention has suffered is that police officers are asked to do too much. In addition to confronting crime, they also deal with mental health problems, addiction and homelessness, as well as the occasional lost dog. Body cameras and bystanders’ cellphones, which increase the likelihood that officers will be held responsible for misconduct, put them under high levels of scrutiny.
“We have asked too much from police, and it has caught up with us nationally,” Zack said.
He and others noted that the police had gone through similar periods of crisis and low morale before but that the challenges of the past year had been more sustained.
Some police agencies are responding by trying to widen the pool of applicants, in some cases using federal dollars from the American Rescue Plan to buttress their efforts.
The New York Police Department recently waived its $40 registration fee for people who want to take the police test, officials said. In April, applications jumped by about a quarter, with 14,502 people signing up.
Some cities lowered the amount of college education recruits needed, while Allentown, Pennsylvania, proposed that a ban on recruits who had used marijuana up to three years before be reduced to one year.
Police officials and experts said the changes could present an opportunity for departments to focus on what kind of men and women become officers at a time when there is widespread public support for change.
“It is not necessarily a bad thing to have to rethink who you want to be a police officer,” said Philip Stinson, a former officer who is now a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Story of a Famous COVID Widow

LOS ANGELES — Amanda Kloots is not surprised that she’s famous.
You don’t move to New York from Ohio at 18, go to countless thanks-but-no-thanks auditions, dust yourself off again and again, or practice tap dance nightly on your small apartment bathroom floor in case a spot in the ensemble for “42nd Street” or the Rockettes opens because you think you are best suited to a life of quiet anonymity.
But she didn’t anticipate the way she’d get there. “It’s such a juxtaposition, it’s such a weird state” to realize your professional dreams because of a huge, public loss, Kloots, 39, said.
Before the pandemic, she was known to a relatively small social media following as a dancer and fitness instructor. But a few weeks into the quarantine, she became famous for juggling life and grief when COVID-19 unleashed its fury on the lungs of her husband, Nick Cordero, the 41-year-old star of Broadway musicals including “Waitress” and “A Bronx Tale.”
On Instagram, for hundreds of thousands of people glued to their phones and searching for guidance, Kloots gave voice to the agonies, anxieties and isolation suffered by those whose loved ones were infected by the virus.
When her husband first went into the hospital, in late March 2020, she had about 50,000 followers. But as word spread about a young mother and wife’s frequent social media dispatches, which included daily totems like “AK! Positive Thought of the Day” and a 3 p.m. singalong to “Live Your Life,” a go-for-your-dreams rock anthem written and recorded by Cordero, Kloots’ following grew to more than 600,000.
It was the pandemic’s early days, and she urged Americans to take the threat of the disease seriously, to stay home, stay active, stay spiritual, stay hopeful.
“Please sing, please cheer and please pray for Nick today,” she said to her followers last May. “I know that this virus is not going to get him down. This is not how his story ends.”
Cordero died in July, after a 3 1/2 month hospitalization. Kloots became one of America’s best known widows of the early pandemic era, but she didn’t collapse in heartache, at least not publicly.
“In show business, we live our lives in high and lows,” said the theater director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who worked with Kloots on shows that included “Young Frankenstein” and “Bullets Over Broadway.” “Amanda is a very positive person. In dire times, she will try to will something into being with the force of her positivity.”
Kloots is now a host of “The Talk,” the CBS chat show. Her jump rope-based fitness program, AK! Rope, is offered in Equinox clubs in New York and California. Next week, HarperCollins will publish her memoir, “Live Your Life: My Story of Loving and Losing Nick Cordero.”
She writes of their romance, careers and dreams, and the grief that comes with the quiet. “We always grocery shopped together, at the same store and bought the same things,” she wrote. “Some of those little moments that you would never think of as really mattering have haunted me the most.”
With her sister Anna Kloots, she wrote the book in six months, beginning two weeks after Cordero died. “I’m proud of the work we’ve done,” Amanda Kloots said last week, her long dancers’ legs stretched out on a couch at a friend’s West Hollywood patio. “But, you know, the story is so sad.”
Kloots hopes her experience — though peppered with celebrity cameos and the privileges of being Hollywood-adjacent — will resonate with bereaved partners, suddenly single parents or bystanders unexpectedly caught in the maw of a hospital bureaucracy.
It is among the first COVID-era memoirs, offering a ticktock of her husband’s plight, her search for hope for herself and their son, Elvis, who turns 2 this month, and new details that will surprise even the most avid watchers of her Insta-stories.
As Kloots reveals in the memoir, she was allowed, unlike most people with sick relatives during the pandemic, to visit her husband at Cedars-Sinai several times a week for the last two months of his life. By then, he had tested negative for COVID three times and was not on a floor with COVID patients.
“I never saw him COVID positive. There was no way they would let me in, and I wouldn’t also do that,” she said, “I was a single parent, and I had to make sure I stayed healthy.” The cycle of audition-rejection-audition-success prepared her for the process of asking every person she could think of to help her get to her husband’s bedside. “I probably would have dressed like a doctor and sneaked in if I needed to,” she said last week, kicking her sandals to the ground beneath her. “There was no stopping me.”
Now Kloots is processing the sudden end of a new marriage that looked perfect on social media but in real life was real.
“I was not a good wife,” she said, a self-judgment that those who watched her harrowing 95-day vigil on Instagram might dispute. She says, in this way, her book is in part her attempt to be brutally honest with herself and her fans.
Kloots, action-oriented and a little bit Tracy Flick, met the laid-back Cordero in 2013 when she was cast in the “Bullets Over Broadway” ensemble, with Cordero landing a lead role alongside Zach Braff.
Her first marriage was ending, and Cordero became her confidant, then boyfriend. “A lot of people told me, including Nick, ‘You shouldn’t be dating,’” she said. “I’d say, ‘Nick, right now I just need to be happy, and you make me happy.’”
Though ballyhooed, “Bullets” closed after four months. Kloots had taken side gigs as a dance teacher and began a pivot into the relatively stable world of fitness entrepreneurship. She created a 50-minute workout around jumping rope. As some of her private training clients, including the Instagram influencer Arielle Charnas, showcased their sessions to followers, Kloots’s popularity grew.
Cordero was next cast as Sonny, the male lead of Chazz Palminteri’s “A Bronx Tale,” a Broadway show that ran from late 2016 to August 2018. For a year after, he auditioned frequently but didn’t land a big part.
By then, he and Kloots were married and soon-to-be expecting a baby. She was teaching half-a-dozen fitness classes a day while Cordero, exploring a career change into songwriting, rented an East Village studio to record and mix his music.
“I was not understanding any of it,” she said. “I was like, ‘This is a waste of time, and we have no money.’ He did not feel supported by me. I wasn’t supportive.”
But Cordero was burned out by the audition grind and told his wife he wanted them to move to Los Angeles, where he could get work acting for television and maybe selling music to production companies. Specifically, he wanted to build their life on the winding streets of Laurel Canyon of which Joni Mitchell sang.
Kloots resisted at first, pointing out that in New York, her parents had rented the apartment across the hall to help babysit and two of her sisters lived nearby. Plus, Cordero was known by casting agents there (and not in Los Angeles) and her New York clientele was growing.
“We fought about it for a year,” she said, “and I finally came to a place of, ‘This is marriage, you have to compromise.’”
They moved in the fall of 2019, staying initially in the guesthouse of their friend Braff. They were still living there, having found a home and started renovations, when Cordero got sick with what they originally thought was pneumonia. His wife took him to urgent care on March 30. By April 1, he was on a ventilator.
In the memoir, Amanda and Anna Kloots recount Cordero’s prolonged medical crisis that spring, which included the amputation of one of his legs in an effort to contain an unrelenting infection. Todd Kloots, their older brother, drove from his home in San Francisco to help care for Elvis, while Amanda tried to stay abreast of her husband’s condition and possible treatments. Anna Kloots, recently divorced and living in Paris, also came to Los Angeles, a setup the siblings thought of as a COVID-era retelling of “Three Men and a Baby.”
Already an avid Instagram user, Amanda shared updates with friends, clients and a growing cadre of concerned strangers who were glued to their phones, scrolling for news, leadership and a way to do something communal, and of service, without leaving the house.
It was before George Floyd’s murder, when the national conversation shifted urgently to police violence and systemic racism, including the inequities revealed by the pandemic. The Trump administration was still downplaying the risk of catching the virus or dying from it.
“This was not only about letting her friends and loved ones know what was going on,” Stroman said. “Amanda was waking up the world to what was happening. In the prime of his life, a man who did eight shows a week with strength and vigor could be taken down by this disease.”
People were messaging Kloots, asking what they could do. When she played music for Cordero and saw his vital signs improve, “I knew my mission,” she wrote in the book. She asked her followers to post videos of themselves singing and dancing at 3 p.m. Pacific Time to Cordero’s “Live Your Life.”
Her singalong became a communal appointment, similar in some ways to the applause and serenades that recognized essential workers in New York, Rome and other cities around the world. By May the song was being played on the radio and Sara Bareilles and the casts of “Waitress” and “A Bronx Tale” performed their own online adaptations. “Live Your Life” eventually hit No. 1 on iTunes.
She received a stream of offers from marketers, film producers, TV writers and documentarians. “I was like, ‘No, no, no and no.’” But when Lisa Sharkey, a senior vice president at HarperCollins (and a one-time attendee of Kloots’ fitness class) contacted her about a memoir, Kloots pitched the idea of writing it with Anna, 32, who has always wanted to be a professional writer. (Anna, who worked with and was married to a magician, is writing her own memoir, for an imprint of HarperCollins, called “My Own Magic.”)
When Cordero was sick and Anna was living with Amanda and Elvis, she took notes, kept journals and recorded her sister’s conversations with doctors. When it came time to write the book, “I had this crazy database of information and notes,” Anna said, in addition to her sister’s archived Instagram updates.
The book comes out as the anniversary of her husband’s death approaches. Just after he died, Kloots Googled “stages of grief” and printed out what she hoped would be a road map.
It wasn’t. The pain ebbs and flows in unanticipated waves.
She is proud that she is raising Elvis in the Laurel Canyon community her husband dreamed about. Still she struggles with regret.
“I learned to appreciate his music too late,” Kloots said. “But I’m determined to keep his voice alive.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Pulitzer Prizes were awarded Friday to news organizations that provided in-depth coverage of the dramatic turns of 2020, a year dominated by a pandemic that left millions dead and a national conversation on race after the murder of George Floyd.
The prize for public service, considered the most prestigious of the Pulitzers, went to The New York Times for its coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, an award shared by many departments at the newspaper. The board called the Times’ coverage “courageous, prescient and sweeping.”
The Pulitzer board also recognized journalism that examined law enforcement practices during a year of worldwide street protests inspired, in part, by the murder of Floyd, a Black man, by a police officer in Minneapolis.
The national reporting award recognized an investigative series on police dogs used as weapons, often against innocent citizens, that was carried out by four news organizations working together: The Marshall Project, a nonprofit outlet focused on criminal justice; AL.com, an Alabama news site; IndyStar, of Indianapolis; and the Invisible Institute, a journalism company based on the South Side of Chicago.
The Tampa Bay Times won the local reporting award for exposing a data-driven policing initiative in Pasco County, Florida, that intimidated residents and labeled some schoolchildren future criminals. The staff of The Star Tribune in Minneapolis won in the breaking news category for its coverage of the murder of Floyd and its aftermath.
The Pulitzer Prizes, first given in 1917 and presented annually by Columbia University for excellence in journalism, books, music and drama, were announced via video livestream by Pulitzer board co-chairs Mindy Marqués González and Stephen Engelberg. Originally scheduled for April, the event was postponed as the pandemic lasted into 2021, giving board members more time to judge the entries.
The board leaders noted that journalists encountered “unparalleled challenges” last year as they worked remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, and sometimes faced the threat of arrest or injury while covering street protests.
Darnella Frazier, the teenager who filmed the murder of Floyd, received a special citation. In her remarks Friday, Marqués González called Frazier’s video “transformative,” adding that it “jolted viewers and spurred protests against police brutality around the world.”
BuzzFeed News won its first Pulitzer, in the international reporting category, for its investigative series on the scale of China’s internment of Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim minority. Mark Schoofs, BuzzFeed News' editor-in-chief, said in a statement that the articles in the series “shine desperately needed light on one of the worst human rights abuses of our time.”
Another first-time winner was The Atlantic, which was awarded the Pulitzer in the explanatory reporting category for coverage of the pandemic by Ed Yong. A second explanatory reporting prize was given to five Reuters journalists for an examination of a Supreme Court protection that shields police officers who use excessive force.
In the features article category, the board recognized two writers: Mitchell S. Jackson, a freelancer, who produced an account for Runner’s World of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was murdered while jogging in suburban Georgia; and Nadja Drost, also a freelancer, who wrote for The California Sunday Magazine on a group of migrants trying to cross the Darién Gap at the border of Colombia and Panama as they tried to make their way on foot to the United States. (The California Sunday Magazine suspended publication in October after its backer, Emerson Collective, a media organization founded by billionaire investor Laurene Powell Jobs, severed ties with its parent company.)
For books, in the category of general nonfiction, the winner was David Zucchino for “Wilmington’s Lie: The Murderous Coup of 1898 and the Rise of White Supremacy,” a deep study of a coup against the multiracial government in the coastal North Carolina city. Zucchino, a contributing writer for the Times, won a Pulitzer in 1989 for his reporting from South Africa.
Marcia Chatelain won the award in history for “Franchise: The Golden Arches in Black America,” on the relationship between McDonald’s and Black communities. Louise Erdrich won in the fiction category for the novel “The Night Watchman”; Natalie Diaz in poetry with “Postcolonial Love Poem”; and Les Payne and Tamara Payne in biography for “The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X.”
In addition to its public service Pulitzer on Friday, the Times won for criticism, an honor that went to Wesley Morris, a critic-at-large who writes on a wide range of topics, often with an emphasis on contributions by Black artists to American culture. His 2020 work included a meditation on the important role played by Black Americans with camera phones in the civil rights movement. It was the second Pulitzer for Morris, who won in the same category for his essays at The Boston Globe in 2012.
The public service award honored contributions from several departments at the Times, including national, science, international, Washington, investigations, business, graphics, video, live briefings and audio. The board cited not only news articles that chronicled the pandemic’s deadly progress but also the graphics department’s virus case tracker, a video capturing 72 hours inside a New York hospital and an episode of “The Daily” podcast.
Among the coverage cited was a Feb. 2, 2020, article by science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr., which sounded an early alarm about the COVID-19 virus. McNeil, a veteran of the Times, left the newspaper earlier this year after he was criticized for using a racial slur while on a Times-sponsored student trip to Peru in 2019.
The Times marked its wins by assembling a group of staff members in the paper’s newsroom, which has been largely empty since last March, when the great majority of Times employees started working remotely. Dean Baquet, the executive editor, noted that “literally hundreds of people had a hand in this coverage.”
“You did something historic and large here,” he said in his remarks, “something that will stay with you forever, I hope.”

Policing Reform Negotiations Sputter in Congress Amid Partisan Bickering

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — Efforts to strike a bipartisan compromise on a national policing overhaul are teetering on the edge of a collapse in Congress, as yearlong negotiations threaten to break down under the weight of fraught ideological differences and a rapidly closing window for action.
After a Minneapolis jury in April found the white police officer who killed George Floyd guilty of murder, lawmakers in both parties were cautiously optimistic that the verdict would provide fresh momentum to break the impasse that had bedeviled negotiators since Floyd’s death. President Joe Biden gave his support, too, calling on Congress to act by the anniversary of the murder, in late May.
But that deadline has come and gone, and weeks after the verdict, negotiators are still at odds over the same roster of divisive issues, most notably whether to change criminal and civil penalties to make it easier to punish police officers for misconduct. Now, lawmakers working to break the stalemate and police lobbying groups involved in the talks are squabbling over a new proposal, and there remains no clear path to bridging their divides before a self-imposed deadline at the end of June.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do still,” said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Republicans’ lead emissary on the issue who had been taking a more upbeat tone as recently as last week. “The devil’s in the details, and we’re now meeting the devil.”
Scott and his Democratic counterparts — Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Karen Bass of California — had hoped to be stitching up the final details of a rare bipartisan agreement right about now. The two sides repeatedly expressed optimism that they could merge competing proposals introduced last summer into a single bill to improve officer training, create a national database to track police misconduct, and make it easier for victims of misconduct to sue officers or their departments in court.
Instead, on Thursday, Democrats and Republicans found themselves trading veiled barbs over a written proposal circulated this week by Booker that appears to have only driven the two parties further apart and pitted powerful law enforcement groups against one another.
Democrats told their Republican counterparts that at least one such group, the Fraternal Order of Police, had lent its support to key provisions of the document, according to congressional aides familiar with the talks. The New York Times obtained a copy of the text.
The proposed measure would lower the threshold for the federal government to prosecute officers who commit egregious misconduct and violate an individual’s constitutional rights. It would also alter the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity to make it easier for victims or their families to sue police departments and municipalities, but not individual officers.
But rather than yielding a major breakthrough, Booker’s idea appeared to backfire. Republicans charged him with acting alone in an attempt to sway key policing interests in favor of an overly liberal bill. The more conservative National Sheriffs’ Association blasted its contents and began lobbying hard against it on Capitol Hill, and the Fraternal Order of Police quickly fired back.
“There ain’t no way in hell that’s going anywhere,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “The conversations we had about police reform were completely different than the document that was produced.”
Graham argued that the proposed changes to the criminal code would allow “the most liberal federal prosecutors” to ruin the lives of individual police officers who caused minor injuries like cuts and abrasions — a contention one Democratic aide dismissed as exaggeration. Republicans have been more supportive of making it easier for victims to sue departments and cities, but also took issue with how Booker had structured that change.
“If a union believes this is a good deal for cops, I’d be wanting my dues back if I were a cop,” Graham said, referring to the Fraternal Order of Police.
Jonathan Thompson, the executive director of the sheriffs' group, said his members had “grave concerns” about the draft, “but remain open to the possibility that something balanced and reasonable is achievable.”
Jim Pasco, the FOP’s executive director, unequivocally denied that the organization had weakened its standards for protecting officers and said that the group would not back legislation that did.
“We would never sell out our members for any reason,” he said in an interview.
In a knock on the National Sheriffs’ Association, Pasco added that the group “is often upset, and sometimes it is difficult to ascertain the exact reason for it.”
The public spasm of discontent underscored the delicate balancing act required to move forward. While the death of Floyd and the national protest movement it inspired helped drastically shift public opinion on matters of race and policing last summer, Republicans have also leaned heavily into political attacks that portray Democrats as the enemies of law enforcement, and themselves as its protectors.
Democrats badly want a deal but believe a final product that fails to make it easier to hold officers responsible for wrongdoing would not adequately respond to the racism they argue is coursing through American policing.
Thursday’s pessimism also broke the upbeat tone that has surrounded the talks for months. With lawmakers willing to divulge only the sparest of details from their talks, media reports have frequently exaggerated the extent of their progress, adding another layer of difficulty to getting a deal. Scott, Booker and Bass may not have helped. In an effort to create a sense of momentum, they have repeatedly told reporters they expect a breakthrough in a few days, or a week, or imminently. Each deadline has passed without a deal.
“We are days, but that could be 30 days or 25 days — who knows?” Booker said Thursday, when pressed by reporters to account for conflicting assessments of when the group might reach a conclusion — if it can. “There’s a lot of work to be done in a very short period of time.”
Graham and other Republicans close to the talks insisted there was still reason for optimism. Booker, Scott and others involved in the discussions are set to meet next week with key law enforcement groups.
“There will be several versions of it,” said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. “We’re still going to get it solved. I’m not worried about it.”
The current deadline, the end of June, would appear to be a firm breaking point, though. If negotiators cannot reach an agreement among themselves by then, they likely would not have enough time to gauge support among their parties more broadly and bring it to the floor for a lengthy debate and vote before Congress leaves town for a six-week summer recess. Once lawmakers are back, both sides agree the specter of midterm campaigning is likely to overwhelm any bipartisan goodwill on such a politically fraught issue.
“There is momentum for a deal,” said Holly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network. “In fact, I would even call it desperation for a deal. But there are significant challenges ahead. I would just urge those who work on this and really want a deal and want to change laws and lives, don’t add to those obstacles.”
Negotiations on policing reform first fell apart last summer after Senate Republicans refused to take up Democrats’ expansive bill, named after Floyd, that would have curtailed qualified immunity, made it easier to prosecute misconduct, and placed direct mandates on police departments, including restrictions on deadly use of force. Democrats in turn blocked a Republican-led effort to pass more modest legislation led by Scott that encouraged departments to change their practices and included penalties for departments that did not restrict the use of chokeholds or require use of body cameras.

WASHINGTON — At Fort Bragg, one of the nation’s largest military installations, plans are afoot for its first commemoration of Juneteenth, highlighting the role of the Union Army in emancipation.
The Defense Department recently added a deputy inspector general for diversity and inclusion and supremacist, extremism and criminal gang activity. In February, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the military to examine extremist activity in its midst and to ask troops for their views. Earlier, Austin had revoked a ban on diversity training for the military, and on Wednesday, he spoke at a Pride Month celebration at the Pentagon.
Its active wars ending, its ranks both smaller and more diverse and its talent needs shifting, the Pentagon is embracing ideas like inclusion and adopting many of the efforts long used in the private sector to recruit and retain women and people of color.
Yet while many inside and outside the military have embraced the effort as overdue, some Republican lawmakers and influential conservatives are mounting an inchoate but increasingly loud protest and promoting the idea that the armed forces are becoming the latest pawn in America’s culture wars.
They have taken aim at a variety of initiatives, including a possible Pentagon plan to increase monitoring of social media posts from service members and the addition of reading recommendations on “white supremacy and systemic racism” to military training guides.
In stoking opposition, those critics say the Pentagon’s policies amount to imposing a liberal, and in some cases unpatriotic, worldview on the armed forces.
At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the military budget Thursday morning, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., grilled Austin as to whether he believed that the military “is a fundamentally racist organization.”
He ticked off a long list of complaints he said his office had received from service members about mandatory training sessions on “police brutality, white privilege and systemic racism.”
Austin responded that he did not believe the military was racist but defended the department’s policies.
“Diversity, equity and inclusion is important to this military now and it will be important in the future,” he said.
At times cutting off Austin when he tried to reply, Cotton warned, “We’re hearing reports of plummeting morale, growing mistrust between the races and sexes where none existed just six months ago, and unexpected retirements and separations, based on these trainings alone.”
How widely those views are actually held among service members in an increasingly politically diverse military is impossible to know. Military culture varies by service branches, rank and generations.
But the Pentagon’s leadership says its approach is necessary both to uphold the nation’s values and to assure that it can recruit people with the skills necessary for 21st-century warfare.
“The secretary has been very clear and fairly unapologetic about the fact that we want to get all the best talent that is available from the American people,” said John F. Kirby, a spokesman for Austin.
“If you meet the standards, and you’re qualified to be in the military, and you’re willing to raise your hand and serve this country, we want you to be able to do it and we want you to be able to do it free of hate and fear and discrimination,” he said. “We owe you that.”
Even since President Harry S. Truman integrated the military, Americans have debated whether the services should lead or lag civilian society on social change concerning race, sex and sexual orientation, and the extent to which they are a threat to effective combat.
The newest efforts are driven in part by the participation of some active-duty military members and veterans at the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, as well as by a desire to recruit and retain more Americans outside an increasingly narrow list of ZIP codes largely in the South and West. As national security needs shift from brawn to brains, some of the moves reflect the increased demand for science, technology and engineering skills coming from a bigger talent pool.
The problems military women — the fastest growing group of veterans — and people of color face have been well documented for years. Promotions often elude minority officers, sexual assault remains rampant, racist extremism threatens Black and Latino service members. Austin, the first Black defense secretary, has spoken about confronting troops with Nazi insignia at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, when he served there.
For generations, military bases retained the names of disgraced Confederate officers — even after the military was racially integrated — the Ku Klux Klan was known to recruit just outside some installations. African American and Hispanic service members are more likely to be court-martialed than white service members, according to the Government Accountability Office.
After years of battles over their role in the military, women continue to face workplace impediments and worse while serving.
Sexual assault cases have barely budged over the past decade, drawing the impatience of lawmakers who are now seeking to remove a general’s role in adjudication of assault cases. Students nominated by Congress to the military service academies remain disproportionately male. There is a continued fight in the Army and beyond about fitness standards for women.
There have been clashes over political ideology. A lieutenant colonel in the Space Force, Matthew Lohmeier, was removed from his post after he said on a podcast that Marxism was invading the military, a theme of his book.
The military’s moves toward inclusive policies predate Austin and the 2020 election.
The Marine Corps issued a ban on displays of the Confederate battle flag at its installations last year. Congress last year moved to change the names of bases named after Confederate officers, a shift that former President Donald Trump resisted. The Army has prohibited photographs from promotion packets that could indicate race, ethnicity or gender. All service branches have looked at hairstyle and grooming policies that are biased against Black and female members.
Trump’s defense secretary, Mark Esper, also ordered Pentagon leaders to present ideas for diversity and inclusion.
But with President Joe Biden now in the White House, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters are using those moves as a wedge issue, appealing to a portion of the conservative base by suggesting that Democrats are promoting far-left theories and potentially undercutting national security.
Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., has written a letter to the superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point demanding congressional oversight of its diversity workshops.
Rep. Daniel Crenshaw, R-Texas, with the help of Cotton, started a “whistleblower” page on his website, where service members can report overt complaints of “woke-ness.” Cotton’s office has received hundreds of complaints about the politicization of the military, an aide said. (On social media, many widely mocked the page by responding with plotlines from movies and television shows like “M*A*S*H” and “A Few Good Men.”)
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took to Twitter to complain about a recruitment ad featuring a female soldier whose parents are both women, drawing an unusual rebuke from Austin.
“Sen. Cruz has been clear about his long-standing and deepening concern that Democrats are using our military as a laboratory for woke ideology,” his spokesman, Christian McMullen, said in an email.
Tucker Carlson, the Fox News personality and one of the most influential figures on the American right, led his Memorial Day broadcast by highlighting some of the changes and suggested that the military was no longer “interested in protecting the country.”
To some Democrats, it is the Republican critics who are endangering national security by injecting politics and ideology into the military.
“This is an attempt to disrupt the chain of command and cause dissension in the ranks,” said Stephen Webber, a Marine veteran who is a former chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party. “Every American should be very worried about what Crenshaw is trying to do. This is the continuation of a lot of attempts made by Trump to drag the military into elections, which the military, to their great credit, resisted.”
Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., who served as an Army Ranger in Afghanistan, said the Republican arguments were corrosive to the military.
“When those in the military are receiving mixed messages from their civilian leadership, that does not help commanders create relationships based on trust,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Tenement Museum Makes Room for Black History

There is no shortage of ghosts at the Tenement Museum, which for nearly three decades has explored issues of immigration, home and belonging through tours of the meticulously re-created apartments in its five-story building on the Lower East Side of New York City. But in recent years, the story of one particularly ghostly presence has lingered in the background.
In 2008, shortly after the opening of an apartment telling the story of Joseph Moore, a 19th-century immigrant Irish waiter, a museum educator noticed something interesting in an 1869 city directory. Right above Moore’s name was another Joseph Moore, also a waiter, living a few neighborhoods away.
Same name, same profession. But there was an extra designation — “Col’d,” or Colored.
The educator started inviting visitors to think about the two Joseph Moores. How would their lives have been similar or different? As other educators picked up the story, a conversation grew about how to talk about “the other Joseph Moore” — and about the museum’s broader omissions.
Now, as the museum celebrates its reopening with a block party June 12, it is leaning hard into the story of the Black Joseph Moore. It is researching an apartment re-creation dedicated to him and his wife, Rachel — its first dedicated to a Black family. And it is introducing a neighborhood walking tour called “Reclaiming Black Spaces,” which explores sites connected with nearly 400 years of African American presence on the Lower East Side.
The museum is also revising all of its apartment tours to look more squarely at the ways that race and racism shaped the opportunities open to the mostly white immigrants whose struggle and striving is explored there.
“Basically, we’re taking apart everything and putting it back together again,” Annie Polland, the museum’s president, said in an interview last month, after offering a peek at the as-yet unrestored top-floor apartment that will be dedicated to the Black Joseph Moore.
“Ideas about race were important for understanding every family’s experience, at every moment in time, in New York and on the Lower East Side,” she said.
The reopening comes after a tumultuous year for the museum. Last spring, the pandemic shutdown sent it into a financial tailspin, leading to the furlough of much of its staff, which was also in the midst of a contentious unionization drive.
And in June, after the police killing of George Floyd, some staff members protested what they saw as the museum’s insufficient statement of support for Black Lives Matter. The museum quickly issued a second, more self-critical statement, committing itself to “addressing the damaging ways we have educated about immigrant, migrant and refugee history, while omitting Black history.”
The museum, with its pre-pandemic annual budget of $11.5 million, may be a small institution. But it is taking on an enormous — and enormously fraught — question: How does a museum — and a nation — that celebrates the immigrant experience incorporate the stories of Black people who were brought here involuntarily and who for centuries remained shut out of the opportunity and full citizenship open to most newcomers?
“The museum has always looked at the question of how people become American,” said Lauren O’Brien, lead researcher on the Joseph Moore project and the new walking tour. “But what does it mean to be born an American but not seen as an American?”
‘This Is Our Ellis Island’
The first stop on the walking tour, near the corner of Allen and Rivington streets, a few blocks north of the museum, makes clear that people of African descent were part of New York City from the beginning.
In the 1640s, it was the site of the 6-acre farm of Sebastiaen de Britto, one of a group of enslaved Africans who in 1647 successfully petitioned the Dutch East India Co. for partial freedom and land. His farm was part of a larger area, outside the official boundaries of New Amsterdam, known as “Land of the Blacks.”
That early Black presence has become better known since 1991, when the remnants of a colonial-era African burial ground were discovered in lower Manhattan, prompting David Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, to declare, “This is our Ellis Island.”
In the archives of the museum, O’Brien discovered a letter from a woman named Gina Manuel from 1988, the year of its founding, urging the founders to include the story of Black Lower East Siders.
“When you are planning the museum, I beg of you, please, please don’t forget them,” she wrote. “Their spirit walks those halls, and their bones lay in the earth there, and we remember them.”
O’Brien also found evidence that in the museum’s early years, there had been some storytelling around a composite 19th-century Black family named the Washingtons. But that fell away as the museum focused on its distinctive approach: tours of re-created apartments that would zero in on families that had actually lived at 97 Orchard St. between 1863, when the building was erected, and 1935, when it was boarded up.
That created a magical physical time capsule but also a limitation. Today, the eight restored spaces at 97 Orchard St. present the stories of German, Irish, Italian and Eastern European Jewish families. But the museum’s researchers never found any evidence that the more than 7,000 people who lived in the building over the years included any Black families.
In 2017, the museum opened a second building just up the block, which allowed it to add stories of a Chinese immigrant and a Puerto Rican family and extend the timeline into the 1980s. But researchers also found no clearly documented Black residents, either immigrant or native-born, in that building.
By then, some educators had started filling in the gaps with the “other” Joseph Moore story.
“People talked about it in their own way,” said Daryl Hamilton, the educator who first noticed the two Josephs in the city directory and mentioned it in his tour. “One of the great things about the Tenement Museum is, we educators are left to interpret and present things in ways that feel right to us.”
Over the years, the museum has invited Black history scholars like Leslie Harris, author of “In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City, 1626-1863,” to speak with its staff. And in 2019, it hired O’Brien, a graduate student at Rutgers University-Newark, to research what became the “Reclaiming Black Spaces” walking tour.
For some museum staff members, it was not enough. In a recent article about labor issues at the museum published in the journal The Public Historian, Erin Reid, an educator who was laid off last July, said managers had not been supportive of all educators’ approaches to the Black Joseph Moore story.
“We weren’t supposed to talk about a lot of this,” Reid recalled. “Managers would be like, ‘Well, why are you talking about the draft riots? Why are you talking about slavery?’”
Polland, who became the museum’s president in January (after a stint as head of programs and interpretations from 2009-18), acknowledged that some educators “felt unheard.” And she said that earlier revisions of the Irish apartment tour had left some difficult questions “unresolved,” including how to incorporate complex topics like the 1863 Civil War draft riots, during which white mobs (including Irish immigrants) attacked Black New Yorkers.
But the museum, Polland said, “was listening and trying to figure out the best ways to handle the material, given the structure they had.”
City of Opportunity?
The Joseph and Rachel Moore apartment, on the fifth floor, won’t open until fall 2022. But starting in July, the existing Moore tour, called “Irish Outsiders,” is being replaced with a hybrid tour discussing both Joseph Moores and offering a preview of the museum’s detective work.
The Black Moore was born free in 1836 in Belvidere, NewJersey, a rural town halfway between New York and Philadelphia. (Slavery was not fully abolished in New Jersey until the Civil War.) He moved to New York City in the late 1850s.
By 1869, as the directory shows, he was living in a rear tenement at 17 Laurens St., in what is now SoHo. (Both the street and the building no longer exist.) In the 1860s, the Eighth Ward — and Moore’s tenement — housed a mixture of Black, Irish and intermarried Black-Irish households.
The museum talks about Moore as a kind of internal immigrant, coming to New York to seek opportunity — and perhaps greater safety at a time when the Fugitive Slave Act put even free Blacks in danger of kidnapping. In mid-19th-century New York, waiting tables was a well-paid job, with Black waiters much in demand. (The finished Moore apartment will include a copy of an 1848 manual by Black hotel steward Tunis Campbell, believed to be the first of its kind.)
And highly skilled Black waiters were sometimes paid more than their immigrant white counterparts — partly, Harris notes in a film made for the museum’s recent fundraising gala, because they had organized and fought for those wages.
The story of relations between Black and Irish New Yorkers is often remembered as one mainly of antagonism, which flared into violence in the 1863 draft riots. And after the Civil War, according to Harris, Black waiters were increasingly pushed out, as white patrons demanded to be served by whites.
But the picture, the museum emphasizes, is more complicated. After the riots, some 2,000 Black residents left the city. But in 1869, Moore was still there. Did he have alliances with Irish neighbors that helped protect him, O’Brien wonders?
With many of the European immigrant families whose stories are told at the museum, their descendants climbed the socioeconomic ladder, leaving the tenements for middle-class prosperity in the suburbs.
By the 1880s, Joseph Moore was living in Jersey City, New Jersey. But then his trail, at least so far, goes cold. And for African Americans broadly, O’Brien said, the upward trajectory toward inclusion in the American dream was often blocked.
“You don’t have that neat, clean ending,” she said. “There’s no resolution of being considered an American.”
There’s much to be uncovered about the Black Joseph Moore — including, the museum hopes, some living descendants. But the complexities of the Black story, Polland said, are part of every American’s history, no matter how and when their family came here.
“We’re discovering ourselves again and trying to figure out who we are,” she said of the museum. “Once you start looking for this history, it’s all around us.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

PORTLAND, Ore. — Defund the police? City leaders in Portland tried it. A unit in the fire and rescue bureau, one of the first of its kind in a major city, began this year taking some 911 calls about people in crisis, especially those who are homeless.
Instead of police officers with flashing lights and guns, a paramedic and a social worker would drive up offering water, a high-protein snack and, always and especially, conversation, aiming to defuse a situation that could otherwise lead to confrontation and violence. No power to arrest. No coercion.
“Having someone show up and offer you goods rather than run you off is different, and people respond to it — it softens the mood,” said Tremaine Clayton, a burly, tattooed veteran of 20 years at the fire and rescue bureau who helps run the program.
But this spring, just as the project was preparing for a major rollout into more neighborhoods, there was another plot twist: The new policing alternative was itself mostly defunded. The city decided on a go-slow approach, and the promised $4.8 million expansion evaporated.
Portland, the Oregon city of bridges, bike lanes and left-leaning idealists — beloved, abhorred and caricatured in just about equal measure — is wrestling mightily with the question of what it means to make a city safe and, as it gradually opens up from the COVID-19 shutdowns, to feel safe, too. It is an issue that many American cities are addressing as the economic and societal disruptions of the past year linger and resonate.
Violent crime, especially homicide, has spiked in most urban areas during the pandemic, and many police departments are facing new scrutiny about training and bias since the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis a year ago.
But here in the nation’s 25th-largest metropolitan area, with about 2.5 million people, there is an additional factor that ripples through every public policy choice, and that even the city’s top prosecutor said has to a degree warped the debate about what to do to rebuild a city that Portlanders want and love.
A hardened core of street activists, many of them professing opposition to authority in general, has dug in and shows no signs of going away. (Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, has asked people to stop calling them protesters, but rather what they call themselves: anarchists.) Their numbers are now down to perhaps 25 to 75 on any given night, compared with hundreds in late 2020 and the many thousands who marched last summer in protests after Floyd’s murder.
But they have shown themselves at times to be violent — one was charged with attempted murder after a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the police — destructive of property and highly adaptable, using social media tools and other strategies to divert the police from the targets they select.
Direct actions are promoted on social media with the phrase “No gods, no masters,” a 19th-century anarchist term that indicates a rejection of all forms of authority. More traditional protesters from Black Lives Matter and other movements who try to curtail violence are now ridiculed as “peace police” by the anarchists, who mostly consist of young, white men.
Demetria Hester, a member of Moms United for Black Lives, continues to push for defunding the police but disagrees with the current call for dismantling the entire political system.
“Breaking windows is performative,” she said. “That satisfies them at night, but they don’t have a plan.”
Some prominent Black leaders have been formally distancing themselves, with some calling the anarchists’ rejection of gradual progress just another symbol of privilege that Black people do not have.
“Being able to protest every night is a white privilege, being able to yell at a police’s face is a white privilege,” said Gregory McKelvey, a prominent Black organizer who ran the mayoral campaign last year for Wheeler’s opponent, Sarah Iannarone. “Most Black people across the country do everything they can to avoid cops.”
Still, McKelvey has empathy for those who feel that taking to the streets is their only outlet.
“These are people who have felt like they’ve had no agency or power in their life or in the political system,” he said. “They want to feel powerful, and when you can have the mayor talking about you every single day, and hundreds of police officers show up to fight you every day, you feel more powerful than when you’re sitting at home.”
The protests have led to vicious finger-pointing over who was to blame for the serial destruction that has left so many downtown storefronts shattered and covered with plywood.
Wheeler, heeding the demands of downtown residents and business owners, said the protesters themselves must be held accountable for their destructive attacks.
Protesters say the police have escalated the situation. This year, the Justice Department said that the city’s Police Bureau was violating its own use-of-force policies during crowd-control operations, and that supervisors were not properly investigating complaints.
Not so fast, the city shot back. The problem was at least partly created when former President Donald Trump sent in federal agents last summer, escalating the violence, the city attorney, Robert Taylor, said in a vehement response.
One former Portland Police commander, Martin Rowley, who retired in 2007 but oversaw the policing of protests in the 1990s and early 2000s, said he saw things turn from bad to worse over the past year as a result of frustration, rage and fatigue.
“You had officers who had been exposed to this environment over and over and over and over and over again, day after day after day, couldn’t get rotated out. Had days off canceled, had vacations canceled,” he said. At the same time, he said, protests evolved from peaceful marches to confrontational direct actions. “One-on-one confrontations escalates the use of force,” he said.
The Portland Police Bureau declined repeated requests for comment.
Perhaps the most stark outcome of the anarchist entrenchment has been a rift between the police and the Multnomah County district attorney, Mike Schmidt. Elected last year in the middle of the crisis, Schmidt immediately announced that he would focus on prosecuting cases of violence or vandalism; protesters who simply resisted arrest or refused to disperse after a police order would not necessarily be charged. The police continued to make arrests for those lesser offenses, and Schmidt kept dismissing them.
At a meeting he had with the bureau’s riot squad late last year, Schmidt said, the officers did not hold back.
“They were like, ‘Why are you doing this? Your policy is putting my life in danger,’” he recounted. “‘You’ve emboldened the protesters by giving them this free pass that they can do whatever they want to us.’”
Schmidt said he was struck by how the police seemed to view his prosecution policy from an us-vs.-them perspective.
“It was like, ‘There’s our team and there’s their team, and you are on their team and you’re not on our team. And we’ve never had a DA not be on our team before,’” he said.
As the George Floyd protests waned elsewhere in the country, demonstrations in Portland continued almost nightly, for months on end. Video clips of burning trash barrels, broken windows and police in riot gear populated YouTube.
“You see images that make it seem like ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,’” said Phillip Atiba Goff, a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale University who co-founded the Center for Policing Equity, an advocacy group that works to reduce bias in policing.
The rise in gun violence in the city — there were 891 shootings in 2020, more than double the number the previous year — has created what Goff calls a “correlation fallacy,” that protest equates to rising violent crime. Many big cities have seen a recent spike in violent crime, with little direct connection to street protests or law enforcement philosophy, he said.
“Portland is a dangerous potential distraction,” he said. “If you look at where progressive prosecutors were elected, homicide jumped; if you look at where they were defeated, homicide also spiked.”
But even as Portland’s streets shook with anger, they were also filled, more and more, by the victims of disruption in the city’s fabric — people without a place to live, rendered homeless by social and economic dislocations of the pandemic. The spiraling problem is obvious throughout the city’s downtown, which is sprinkled with sidewalk encampments of tents.
The rising numbers of homeless people turned the new fire and rescue unit, called Portland Street Response, into a leading front in the effort to quell the crisis. Like several similar programs that have recently started or are in planning in Denver; Rochester, New York; Oakland, California; and San Francisco, the effort is modeled after a project begun in Eugene, Oregon, in 1989.
Portland’s new team, as well as the city’s 911 dispatchers, had to learn as they went. What calls were too dangerous, and therefore would still require a police response? Some were obvious — a person wielding a firearm warranted an officer on the scene. In more uncertain circumstances, dispatchers developed a series of triage questions to the 911 caller: Is a weapon present? Can it be seen?
“The dispatchers are learning it as they go,” said Britt Urban, a clinical social worker on the response team.
City leaders had initially planned a major expansion of the program, but after vigorous debate the City Council last month backed the mayor’s plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot effort before expanding it.
“I have one priority, and only one — that’s outcomes,” Wheeler told the council.
Many people here say that the battle over what kind of city Portland will be, what values it will represent, what lessons it will draw from a tumultuous year, is now coming down to the question of fatigue — on the part of the police, city leaders, business owners and downtown residents. After 2020, the old status quo has started sounding pretty good.
But many, especially in the Black community, are warning that an ache for normalcy must be resisted. Portland, they say, cannot just bandage over the wound that cries out the loudest in its pain and anger.
“We can’t yet see where it’s going to end up, but whatever it is, we can’t allow things to go back,” said Taji Chesimet, 19, a college student and co-chair of the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing, which reports to Wheeler.
Chesimet, who grew up in the city, said he thought Portland would ultimately be not just the city that showed the world what happened when streets explode in violence, but how a city could change.
“We can be the model,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

About three years ago, JC Lau, a game developer, was one of a handful of women of Asian descent working at Bungie, a large video game studio in Bellevue, Washington. At the office, which had an open-floor plan and a staff of predominantly white men, co-workers regularly approached Lau mistaking her for one of the other Asian employees sitting in another row nearby.
On one occasion, multiple colleagues congratulated Lau, who identifies as Chinese Australian, on a presentation led by a colleague of Korean heritage. “These were people I worked with on a daily basis,” she said.
Lau, 40, left the company in 2018, after two years, and she said a major factor behind that decision was feeling she wasn’t being recognized for her contributions, which included testing games and founding the company’s diversity committee. She suspected that her gender and race — and her co-workers’ inability to even recognize who she was — put her at a disadvantage, especially at a large company.
“We have to do more to stand out from any other Asian we might be mistaken for in order to advance,” she said. Lau left Bungie to become a producer at a smaller games studio.
White-collar professionals are preparing to return to the office after more than a year of working from home. It hasn’t been a year of just video calls and Zoom happy hours, though. In the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s been a year of reckoning over racial injustice in America. In the corporate world, that injustice manifests in unequal career opportunities for professionals of color. The country has also seen a rise in hate crimes against people of Asian descent, with victims who have been beaten, verbally assaulted and, in some cases, killed. In response, many companies have started “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs aimed at recalibrating their office cultures to be more supportive of minority workers.
But as a first step, what many Asian American professionals need is simple. They want their colleagues to bother to learn their names.
Microaggressions at Work
Yes, it’s probably happened to all of us, no matter our identity: An acquaintance or colleague mistakes you for another person with the same hairdo or a similar name. But for people of Asian descent, it happens without question when there are other Asians in the office, even when they look and sound nothing alike. In nearly two dozen conversations with professionals of Asian descent in recent weeks, and in 15 years of my own experience in the workplace, the consensus was clear: It happens again and again, from one job to the next. There’s even a term for it: the interchangeable Asian.
“That particular microaggression of being mistaken for another Asian American is unique,” said Jeff Yang, an Asian American culture critic. “It stems from this different place where people tend to collectivize us in their imagination.”
As part of our conversation, Yang posted a callout on Twitter: “Any of you have funny-not-funny workplace #SorryWrongAsian stories to share?” The post generated more than 350 responses from a wide variety of people, including professionals with South and East Asian heritage. Workers recounted receiving emails meant for other colleagues, being thanked for meetings that never happened and getting lectured by a supervisor for paperwork that someone else filled out incorrectly.
I spoke with people working across industries including marketing, academia, tech, publishing, health care and entertainment and only one person said she had never been mistaken for another Asian at work. (She is a novelist who never had co-workers.) For everyone else, these were regular occurrences. The name bunglers were usually white colleagues, but in rare cases, they were people of color. A common reaction was to shrug it off as an uncomfortable moment that was ultimately an innocent mistake.
Yet scholars of sociology, psychology and Asian American history said there was something serious — and damaging — behind this phenomenon of casual Asian-face blindness that borders on cavalier. Some pointed to unconscious biases that make office workers less inclined to remember the names and faces of Asian colleagues, in large part because of their lack of exposure to people of Asian descent in their personal lives and in mainstream media. Others labeled the carelessness a form of discrimination derived from stereotypes with deep roots in American history that people with Asian heritage all behave and look alike — an army of nameless automatons not worth remembering for promotions.
“Most people of color face these microaggressions where they’re presumed to be like everyone else in their group, and one way this manifests is people can’t get their names right,” said Kevin Nadal, a professor of psychology at John Jay College in New York who has led studies on the impact of subtle forms of discrimination against marginalized groups. “They’re grouping them with each other, not taking the time to acknowledge their contributions, successes and capabilities. That very much can have an effect on people’s ability to succeed.”
If one requirement to ascend in your career is to be distinguishable to people in power, it may come as no surprise, then, that Asian Americans — who make up 7% of the U.S. population and are the fastest-growing racial group — are the least likely group to be promoted in the country, according to multiple studies. Even in Silicon Valley, where people of Asian descent make up roughly 50% of the tech workforce, a rare few rise to the executive level; most peak at middle management. The problem is especially acute for women. In one study with a sample of about 9,200 Asian female professionals, only 36 had reached the executive level.
Lau, the game developer, understands the daily experiences behind those numbers: the challenge of pushing for a promotion if people don’t know your name.
“If at any point a person says, ‘I don’t know who this person is or their contributions,’ that is a dire threat to any sort of advancement,” she said.
A Case of Mistaken Identity
Winnie Cheng, a nurse in Vancouver, British Columbia, was working a recent hospital shift alongside her colleague, a male doctor. Although the two had been treating patients together for several years, the doctor referred to her as Hannah — the name of another hospital worker of Asian descent. Cheng froze. After some thought, she decided it would be too awkward to correct him.
To her chagrin, the case of mistaken identity went on for several hours, with the doctor calling her Hannah even in front of patients. Cheng, 28, asked a co-worker to call her by her name in front of the doctor in the hope that he would correct himself. This failed. Finally, another co-worker called him out on the mistake. The doctor, who is of Indian descent, she said, was extremely embarrassed and apologetic.
Months later, Cheng was called Angela by a white male colleague. She said she was frequently mixed up with the two other Asian women she worked with directly, incidents that made her feel that people recognized her for her race, not as an individual.
When she was training a new hire, a tall white man, and introducing him to others, everyone was excited to get to know him. During the training, she never heard anyone mistake him for one of the dozens of other white men working at the hospital, and she wondered if they ever would.
“You can see how that accumulates over a lifetime of work,” Cheng said. “Four years of, they don’t know my name, but after saying his name once, everybody is superinterested in him and giving him opportunities.”
The stereotype that all Asians look alike was an idea sown into the American psyche more than 100 years ago. When politicians were enacting laws to exclude Asians from immigrating into the United States — the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prohibited immigration of Chinese laborers, and the Immigration Act of 1924, a blanket ban on all Asian immigrants and some other groups — they used language that likened the immigrants to “another grain in this pile of sand, another drop in the ocean, that was threatening to overwhelm this nation,” Yang said. And in subsequent decades, when America fought wars in Japan, Korea and Vietnam, soldiers were trained to treat all Asians as though they were part of one evil, collective mass.
“The interchangeable, nameless, faceless but also thoroughly dehumanized Asian American was further solidified during wars,” said Shelley Lee, a history professor at Oberlin College in Ohio. “When the Americans fought in Asia with the goal of killing as many Asians as possible, that also encouraged Americans to dehumanize Asian people, to not empathize with the enemy you’re seeking to destroy.”
Nancy Yuen, a sociologist at Biola University in California, said the inclination of white office workers to more easily remember white colleagues’ faces and names — and fail to tell people of color apart — could be linked to a phenomenon known as cross-race bias, the tendency for people to more easily recognize faces that belong to their own racial group. This behavioral pattern, studies have shown, diminishes as a person has more interactions with people of other races. Citing 2014 data from the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, Yuen noted that 75% of white people didn’t have any nonwhite friends.
“It comes from the fact that they’re not friends with enough people of color to even be able to tell the difference,” Yuen said.
The absence goes beyond people’s individual social circles. In a recent national survey for a civil rights nonprofit, 42% of Americans said they could not name a single Asian American, not even Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was Indian.
The Invisible Asian
On a recent Tuesday evening, Jully Lee and her boyfriend curled up on the couch and turned on the TV to watch the Ovation Awards, a ceremony honoring stage work in the Los Angeles area that was held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.Lee, an actor, had been nominated for her role in the play “Hannah and the Dread Gazebo,” which was in production before the pandemic.
Lee, 40, had submitted a prerecorded acceptance speech in case she won. During the ceremony, each nominee’s photo was shown as his or her name was announced. When Lee’s category arrived, her name was called, and a photo appeared on the screen. A photo of the wrong Asian: her colleague Monica Hong. The announcer also mispronounced Lee’s name.
“I was just stunned,” Lee said. She added that after a pause, she and her boyfriend started cracking up. “When things are awkward or uncomfortable or painful, it’s much safer to laugh than to express other emotions. It’s like a polite way of responding to things,” she said.
The LA Stage Alliance, which hosted the ceremony, disbanded in the wake of the outcry over the blunder.
The irony of a mix-up like this wasn’t lost on Lee. It was rare to even be performing with other Asian actors, rather than competing for the same part. “It’s so funny because when there’s so many Asians, then you can’t tell them apart, but in media there are so few Asians that you can’t tell us apart,” she said. “What is it?”
The invisibility of Asians in pop culture is part of what, scholars say, contributes to the “wrong Asian” experience: When people aren’t accustomed to seeing Asian faces onstage or onscreen, they may have more trouble telling them apart in real life. To put it another way: If all you really have to work with are John Cho, Steven Yeun, Aziz Ansari and Kal Penn, that’s not going to go a long way to train you to distinguish between men of Asian descent offscreen. In contrast, Hollywood has given everyone plenty of training on distinguishing white faces, Nadal said.
Out of Hollywood’s top 100 movies of 2018, only two lead roles went to Asian and Asian American actors (one male and one female), according to a study by the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Donatella Galella, a professor of theater history and theory at the University of California, Riverside, said that popular culture had long reflected the Western world’s xenophobic views toward Asians, which resulted in placing them in diminished roles onstage and onscreen — the villain, the sidekick. That entrenched a kind of marginalization feedback loop.
Before becoming a full-time cartoonist, Gene Luen Yang was a computer science teacher at Bishop O’Dowd High School in Oakland, California. His friend, Thien Pham, a visual arts teacher, was the only other Asian American man working there. Parents and students constantly mixed the two up during Gene Yang’s 17-year tenure. School forms intended for Pham often ended up in the hands of Gene Yang, and vice versa.
Gene Yang got his big break in 2006 when his graphic novel “American Born Chinese” became the first comic book to be a finalist for a National Book Award and it went on to win several other prestigious prizes. A friend who was also a cartoonist told him to expect a flood of phone calls coming from Hollywood agents bidding to adapt his book into a movie or TV show. Yang secured a media agent. Yet no such calls or offers came in. “The Asian face just isn’t salable or marketable enough,” he said.
The Asian Glass Ceiling
There is a Japanese proverb that states, “The quacking duck gets shot.”
It stands in stark contrast to a Western idiom: “The squeaky wheel gets the oil.”
At the Ascend Foundation, a firm that analyzes the progress of Asian Americans in the workforce, researchers see the two idioms as one way to understand the numbers.
In one study citing national employment data from 2018, the Ascend Foundation found that white men were 192% more likely to become executives than Asian men, and white women were 134% more likely to become executives than Asian women.
Another study, from 2013, found that while there were nearly as many Asian professionals as white professionals working at five big tech companies (Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo), white men and women were 154% more likely to be an executive than their Asian counterparts; Asian professionals tended to peak at middle management.
In its report, the Ascend Foundation said part of the problem was implicit bias misguided by the belief that Asians preferred technical roles and did not aspire to leadership levels. But it also suggested that part of the issue might be cultural. Many Asian professionals interviewed by the researchers said that they were taught by their parents to do good work and keep their “heads down.” While Asian cultures differ vastly among ethnicities from South Asia to East Asia, some common values include a preference for harmony and conflict avoidance — the danger in being that quacking duck.
Is getting comfortable as a squeaky wheel the only way to succeed in corporate America?
Anna Mok might argue yes. She is the president of the Ascend Foundation, and as one of the first Asian American women to rise to an executive role at the consulting firm Deloitte, she experienced her share of mix-ups along the way. She encourages people to speak up for themselves and bond with co-workers over common ground, like shared enthusiasm for a hobby or sports team or coming from the same hometown.
“People remember you because they remember what we have in common,” she said. “You have to lead with that a little bit. I don’t think you can lead with, ‘I’m Asian.’”
But advice about making small talk over sports may not sit well with younger people, and it may also shift the burden to marginalized employees rather than to those making decisions about promotions. Jenn Fang, a scientist who writes a blog about Asian American feminism, said the problem with Asians being treated as interchangeable at work was a systemic one that needed to be discussed with company leaders.
“It’s not something where you can necessarily change your behavior and expect to survive and overcome,” Fang said. “You can do all these things to try to make people remember who you are, but that isn’t going to change anything to make them change the bias.”
Nadal, the psychology professor who has led studies on microaggressions, agreed. “If you’re a person of power and privilege,” he said, “then you have to make those efforts to know people’s names and understand that if you mess up someone’s name, there are real dynamics that are being created and consequences as a result.”
Mok has a counterpoint: Asian workers need to make an effort, too, at the very least by correcting people when they get misidentified. An overwhelming majority of workers I interviewed said they did not clarify to their colleagues that they had been mistaken for the wrong Asian because they wanted to avoid confrontation. “We should use that as an opportunity to teach a colleague something and redirect it, otherwise it’s like a bad habit that no one tells you about,” Mok said.
That does require people to acknowledge when they are wrong, though, which doesn’t always happen. Lau, the game producer, said that in February, she was chatting with a group of ex-Bungie employees on the app Discord when a former co-worker alerted her to a job opportunity that was irrelevant to her work experience.
She realized he probably had intended to share it with another ex-Bungie employee for whom it would have been a good fit, a Filipino American named Cookie. When she pointed this out, he responded, “r u sure?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

MINNEAPOLIS — The bulldozers arrived before dawn Thursday at the South Minneapolis intersection where the police killed George Floyd. Moving quickly, city workers in neon vests hauled away flowers, artwork and large cement barricades that have allowed the corner to serve as an ever-growing memorial to Floyd for more than a year.
By the time hundreds of people began flocking to the scene in protest, many of the tributes at the intersection known as George Floyd Square were gone. The large metal fist that sprouts from the middle of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue was still there, but the barriers that activists used to block traffic had been removed and the city had put most of the items honoring Floyd into storage.
The mayor and other city officials hoped that the effort would let traffic flow through the intersection again, allowing businesses to prosper and cutting down on the violence in the neighborhood. But demonstrators said that the unannounced action was disrespectful to Floyd’s memory and that the city was trying to force people to move on from his killing.
In the weeks after May 25, 2020, when a police officer knelt on Floyd’s neck as he took his last breaths, the intersection was transformed into a community space that people visited from around the world, to pay their respects or simply to say they had been there. In April, hundreds of people gathered in the intersection and erupted in cheers when Derek Chauvin, the white former officer, was found guilty of murdering Floyd, a Black father who had recently lost his job as a security guard.
But the intersection had also become an autonomous zone of sorts that the police avoided; some residents complained that it had become dangerous and detrimental to nearby businesses. Several shootings have erupted in the area, including one last month in which a man was shot in broad daylight on the anniversary of Floyd’s death.
For months, the question of how to preserve the memorial while allowing the neighborhood’s businesses and residents to thrive has vexed city officials. They have announced a series of investments in the area and changed the name of Chicago Avenue to George Perry Floyd Jr. Place for two blocks.
Even as some residents and businesses praised the removal of the sprawling memorial Thursday, others set up new makeshift barriers to block traffic in the one-block radius around the intersection, using lawn chairs, a drying machine and an air conditioner. By the afternoon, traffic was not able to pass freely through the intersection as city officials had hoped.
“I acknowledge that it will be a bit touch-and-go and difficult over the next several days,” Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis said at a news conference.
Frey said the city was investing in Black-owned businesses in the area and that reopening the streets to traffic was just one part of creating an accessible and prosperous neighborhood. “We will be putting our money where our mouth is,” he said.
But others said it was too soon to clear the area, and that doing so with little warning early in the morning was not consistent with city officials’ repeated promises of transparency following Floyd’s death.
“I think it’s wrong,” said D.J. Hooker, a community activist who arrived early Thursday after hearing that the memorial was being taken down. “This is not what they should be doing while people are trying to still heal.”
As protesters were at the intersection Thursday afternoon, they got word that police officers had fatally shot a man at a parking garage elsewhere in the city.
A spokesperson for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office sent a statement from the U.S. Marshals Service, a federal agency, that said its task force members had killed a man who was sitting in a parked car after he showed a handgun. The statement said the task force members, which are often made up of local police officers, were trying to arrest the man on a warrant related to a gun charge, but the agency did not identify the man or the officers who fired.
Jeremy Zoss, the spokesperson for the Sheriff’s Office, would not say whether sheriff’s deputies were the ones who shot the man. A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department said its officers were not involved.
In clearing George Floyd Square, the city partnered with the Agape Movement, an organization that has provided security in the neighborhood since Floyd’s death and has worked to improve the relationship between the police and residents. It has several contracts with the city, including one for up to $359,000 for help with revitalizing the intersection, said Sarah McKenzie, a city spokesperson.
Steve Floyd, a senior member of the Agape Movement, said at the news conference with city officials that it was important to start making the neighborhood more prosperous and peaceful. Steve Floyd, who is not related to George Floyd, said that he had spoken with many residents in recent months about clearing the intersection and that he had coordinated with the city about when to do so to avoid pushback.
Agape Movement members, some of whom have spoken about being former members of gangs, have received harsh criticism from some activists for working with the city, but Steve Floyd said the city’s investment was an example of how local governments can fund community groups instead of the police.
The city crews arrived at about 4:30 a.m. Thursday and began to remove the memorial structures outside Cup Foods, the convenience store where a clerk called 911 last year to say he thought that George Floyd had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes, drawing Chauvin and other officers to the scene.
In a statement, Frey and the two City Council members who represent the neighborhood, Andrea Jenkins and Alondra Cano, said they were “committed to establishing a permanent memorial at the intersection.” The politicians said in the statement that the city was “playing a supportive role” in helping the Agape Movement and other community leaders clear the area, although a member of the Agape Movement dismissed the idea that city officials were not in charge.
“That is the narrative,” said Akeem Cubie, 32, who said the Agape Movement had advised city officials about how to peacefully reopen the intersection. “They don’t want to take the backlash coming in here.”
But Cubie, who grew up near the intersection and now lives elsewhere in Minneapolis, said that the neighborhood had become a hub for gangs and that clearing the memorial would make it safer for the community.
“What is this here for?” he asked, motioning to the intersection filled with protesters. “Is this here for you to just come over here and have a good time? Our life doesn’t turn off even though you probably have a good time. We’ve still got to go home.”
On Thursday, a representative of Cup Foods praised the city’s move to reopen the area to traffic.
“Businesses can once again thrive,” said Jamar Nelson, who has worked as a spokesperson for Cup Foods since Floyd’s death. “Now, hopefully, a memorial can be put in place, to respect the Floyd family and the community.”
Danielle Fabunmi, 48, who lives about six blocks from the intersection, stood in front of Cup Foods on Thursday as she watched city workers dismantle the memorial. She said she felt that the city had bowed to pressure from businesses and residents worried about crime.
“I kind of always knew that it wasn’t going to last, but I’m pretty hurt because there needs to be a reminder of what happened here,” Fabunmi said. “They’re really feeling that a lot of these memorials are kind of getting in the way of business, so that’s to be understood, but also, there’s something larger at hand.”
The scene Thursday was at times tense, with some activists yelling at city officials as they removed the barriers. “No justice, no streets!” one said. But later, the crowd grew more relaxed, with one activist handing out coffee and doughnuts. No uniformed police officers could be seen as the demolition took place.

MINNEAPOLIS — Crews in Minneapolis dismantled barriers around George Floyd Square early Thursday morning, in a move to reopen the intersection where George Floyd was killed beneath the knee of a police officer just over a year ago.
Sarah McKenzie, a spokeswoman for the city of Minneapolis, said that the city was working with a community group, the Agape Movement, and that crew members were taking care to preserve the artwork, artifacts and other memorials at the square, including the sculpture of a raised fist.
“There is a reopening process underway,” she said.
After Floyd’s death, the four-block area of South Minneapolis where he was killed has become a memorial where people gathered to mourn his death, but also to protest against police brutality. In the months that followed, it turned into something of an autonomous zone, with the police staying away to avoid stoking tensions. Signs around the square, with has been blocked off by concrete barriers, call the area “the free state of George Floyd.”
Early Thursday morning, people gathered to watch city workers move the barricades blocking the intersection near Cup Foods, the convenience store in South Minneapolis where a teenage clerk called 911 to report that Floyd had bought cigarettes using a fake $20 bill.
Dozens of city workers and their vehicles were scattered through the area, and caution tape lined the sidewalks. Security booths, built by activists to check for masks, give out hand sanitizer and provide protesters a refuge from the rain and cold, were taken away on a truck.
What to do with the memorial site where Floyd was killed has become its own controversy, with some community activists saying it has become a haven for criminal activity. The area around the intersection suffered a spike in gun violence in the months after Floyd’s death, and shooting victims have been dragged to ambulances because barriers have kept police and emergency vehicles at a distance from the square.
Some activists yelled at city officials Thursday morning as they dismantled the barriers around the square. “No justice, no streets!” one said.
D.J. Hooker, a community activist, said he arrived at the square at about 6:30 a.m. Thursday after hearing that some 100 city workers had arrived in the autonomous zone before sunrise.
“I think it’s wrong,” Hooker said. “I think this is not what they should be doing while people are trying to still heal from Floyd.”
But by 8 a.m., tensions had settled, and an activist was handing out coffee and doughnuts to onlookers. No uniformed police officers appeared to be at the scene.
McKenzie said the changes would allow vehicle traffic to resume at the intersection.
“We certainly acknowledge this intersection will never return to normal, but we’ve heard from residents and businesses that really need to reconnect their neighborhood,” she said.
Steve Floyd, an adviser to the Agape Movement, the community activist group that worked with the city on plans to reopen the square and to establish a long-term memorial at the site, said the changes were important for moving forward.
“We can focus on other things,” he said. “We got to keep moving.”
Some businesses hailed the reopening. Cup Foods was locked, but a spokesman for the store, Jamar Nelson, said the area’s reopening was a positive step forward.
“Businesses can once again thrive,” he said. “Now hopefully a memorial can be put in place, to respect the Floyd family and the community.”
Danielle Fabunmi, who lives in the neighborhood, said she understood George Floyd Square would not always remain the way it had been over the last year, but that it was still painful to watch city workers dismantle the barriers. She said the city had bowed to pressure from local businesses and residents concerned about escalating crime.
“A lot of people are, you know, really hurt about the way that it’s being torn down,” she said. “There needs to be a reminder of what happened here.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A century after a white mob destroyed a vibrant African American community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, torching hundreds of homes and indiscriminately shooting people in the streets, President Joe Biden told a crowd of survivors and their families that the story of the massacre “would be known in full view.”
It was the first time a president had visited the area to address what happened 100 years ago in Greenwood, the African American community in Tulsa, that was the site of one of the worst outbreaks of racist violence in American history but one that went largely ignored in history books.
“For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence,” Biden told the crowd. “While darkness can hide much, it erases nothing.”
Biden, who has made racial equity and justice central themes of his presidency, was there to shed light on a painful part of the country’s history, by recalling in detail the horror that occurred between May 31 and June 1 in 1921, when angry whites descended on Greenwood, a prosperous part of Tulsa known as Black Wall Street, killing as many as 300 people and destroying more than 1,250 homes.
“My fellow Americans, this was not a riot,” Biden said, as people in the crowd rose to their feet. “This was a massacre.”
A man was strapped to a pickup truck and dragged through the street, the president said. The bodies of a murdered family were draped over the fence outside their home. An older couple were shot while praying.
“We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened,” Biden told the crowd in Tulsa. “We should know the good, the bad, everything. That’s what great nations do. They come to terms with their dark sides.”
Biden’s visit was also intended to highlight steps his administration is taking to close the wealth gap between Black and white people in the United States, even as activists criticized him for not going far enough to correct historical wrongs and put the disadvantaged on equal footing.
On Monday evening, administration officials detailed efforts — timed to underscore the president’s visit to Tulsa — that would include efforts to direct more federal spending to small and minority-owned business, fair housing enhancements, and programs that are intended to repair the damage to neighborhoods divided by transportation projects.
Missing from the rollout was a plan to cancel student debt, which disproportionately affects Black students, or address the issue of reparations, federal repayments that relatives of Tulsa victims say could restore what was erased. White House officials have said that, as with the broader issue of reparations for Black Americans, the president supports a study of the issue.
The NAACP and other civil rights groups have criticized the administration for not taking the step to cancel student loans, saying it is one of the biggest obstacles holding Black people back from sharing in the wealth of other Americans.
“Student loan debt continues to suppress the economic prosperity of Black Americans across the nation,” Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, said in a statement. “You cannot begin to address the racial wealth gap without addressing the student loan debt crisis.”
On the way to Tulsa, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House principal deputy press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that the administration had provided, as part of its $1.7 trillion coronavirus plan, billions in funding to Black colleges as a way to make education more affordable, but did not answer questions about alleviating the financial stress of those currently suffering from student debt.
In a briefing for reporters Monday night, administration officials insisted that the other steps would help Black people around the country, particularly hard-hit communities like Greenwood.
Biden’s visit to Tulsa was a somber one. Before he delivered remarks, Biden met privately with survivors of the massacre, each between the ages of 101 and 107, whom he mentioned throughout his speech.
The massacre was sparked by the arrest of Dick Rowland, 19, a Black shoe shiner who was accused of assault against Sarah Page, 17, a white elevator operator. As Biden toured the Greenwood Culture Center, he was told that within 24 hours of that encounter, the mob that formed in the wake of Rowland’s arrest destroyed much of Greenwood. The case was later dismissed.
His trip came as the country struggles to confront police brutality toward Black people and other people of color following a year of Black Lives Matter protests around the country. The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, and other similar episodes, galvanized the country.
But the political response to the recent killings remains uncertain. Biden had vowed to secure passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act by May 25, the first anniversary of Floyd’s death. The bill would ban the use of chokeholds, impose restrictions on deadly force and make it easier to prosecute officers for wrongdoing. He missed that deadline, but lawmakers in both parties have expressed optimism that they will be able to reach a compromise on the legislation in the weeks ahead.
Despite investigations, no one was ever convicted of crimes related to the Tulsa massacre. Biden has promised that his Justice Department will be a more active participant in helping to root out bias and bigotry in American police departments. The department has already begun “pattern or practice” investigations in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, which are intended to examine excessive force, biased policing and other misconduct by officers.

President Joe Biden will meet privately Tuesday with surviving members of the 1921 massacre in Greenwood, the African American community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was destroyed by a white mob 100 years ago, spotlighting on one of the worst outbreaks of racist violence in U.S. history.
Biden, who has made racial equity a central theme of his presidency, is expected to highlight steps he is taking to help financially struggling minority communities and to close the wealth gap between Black and white people in the United States, according to administration officials.
“Frankly, he plans to discuss a shared sense of frustration and pain that justice has been denied to these families for so long,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Oklahoma. “He is traveling to Tulsa to shine a light on what happened, and to make sure America knows the story.”
The president’s announcements — timed to underscore the legacy of anti-Black sentiment that fueled the mob in Greenwood — will include efforts to direct more federal spending to small and minority-owned business, fair housing enhancements, and programs that are intended to repair the damage to neighborhoods divided by transportation projects.
Biden will not announce a plan to cancel student debt, which disproportionately affects Black students. The NAACP and other civil rights groups have criticized the administration for not taking that step, saying it is one of the biggest obstacles holding Black people back from sharing in the wealth of other Americans.
Biden will be the first president to visit Tulsa to commemorate the massacre. The survivors he will meet with — each between the ages of 101 and 107 — lived through the events of May 31 and June 1 in 1921, when angry whites descended on Greenwood, a prosperous part of Tulsa known as Black Wall Street, killing as many as 300 people and destroying more than 1,250 homes. The violent and searing episode was rarely mentioned in history books.
In addition to meeting with the aging survivors, the president will tour the Greenwood Cultural Center and deliver remarks commemorating the victims on the anniversary of the massacre.
The trip comes as the country struggles to confront police brutality toward Black people and other people of color following a year of Black Lives Matter protests around the country. The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, and other similar episodes, galvanized the country.
But the political response to the recent killings remains uncertain. Biden had vowed to secure passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act by May 25, the first anniversary of Floyd’s death. The bill would ban the police’s use of chokeholds, impose restrictions on deadly force and make it easier to prosecute officers for wrongdoing.
He missed that deadline, but lawmakers in both parties have expressed optimism that they will be able to reach a compromise on the legislation in the weeks ahead.
But for the president, his speech and meetings with the survivors are also an opportunity to underscore again his push for racial equity and justice, which he has said are at the heart of his agenda at the White House.
“The attack on Black families and Black wealth in Greenwood persisted across generations,” Biden said Sunday in a proclamation honoring the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre. “The federal government must reckon with and acknowledge the role that it has played in stripping wealth and opportunity from Black communities.”
Administration officials said Biden would not announce any steps specifically aimed at Greenwood and would not call for reparations for the descendants of the massacre 100 years ago. Officials said that, as with the broader issue of reparations for Black Americans, the president supports a study of the issue.
Despite investigations, no one was ever convicted of crimes related to the massacre. Biden has promised that his Justice Department will be a more active participant in helping to root out bias and bigotry in American police departments. The department has already begun “pattern or practice” investigations in Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, which are intended to examine excessive force, biased policing and other misconduct by officers.

Last summer, millions of Americans took to the streets after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. The millions were taking part in what would become the largest protest movement in U.S. history. Many participated in marches and demonstrations for the first time in their lives. From eight first-time protesters, here are reflections on what they did last summer, how this has affected them in the year since and what lies ahead. Their interviews have been edited and condensed.

KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI
Oluwatoyin Keji Akinmoladun, 23
Last May, Akinmoladun, who had never attended a protest, decided to organize one. By the end of that weekend, she had led a demonstration of hundreds, shielded herself from pepper spray and been held for several hours in a jail cell.
I understood later on, this does take a toll on you. Like, this isn’t something you can achieve in one day. And you don’t know when the outcome is going to be.
Because if you’re just being angry all the time, like I was, it is completely draining.
I look back on it and just think: We were really united at that time. Like, everyone, all different states, everywhere, we were really united. I still have strong feelings about it, even get anxiety about it. Any protest I plan, I still have anxiety about it. I don’t know, a part of me just wants it to be over with, the protests. I want the protests to be over with, I want our demands to be met. Like, I just want everything to be over with so I don’t have this heavy, heavy feeling.
I have changed my mind on protesting. Now I’m thinking, protesting is not enough. What more can we do? What other steps can we take? Because protesting has been around for so many years. And if it hasn’t changed since Martin Luther King, what can we do now? You know, do we have to — I don’t want to say, destroy the city , but is that what it’s come to?

BERKELEY SPRINGS, WEST VIRGINIA
Brian Tucker, 53
Tucker is one of the few Black people in his small town, a place he has come to love since moving there seven years ago. In September, he was among several dozen people to attend a Black Lives Matter rally there. Hundreds showed up to counterprotest.
Everything that I thought was going to happen didn’t happen. And the things that I didn’t even think of happening happened. They had such a large turnout of people who were for [President Donald] Trump, it almost seemed like it was a Trump rally. And they basically drowned out every speaker we had.
I’ve been told that I’m trying to push an agenda. I don’t do that because I’m not trying to suffocate people. But if you have a different view, we ought to be able to talk about the views and see how it makes it better for everybody.
I can go into a certain establishment and I get the two stares. The stares of, you know, “I don’t like this person,” and then there’s the other stare of like, “What the hell is that?” You know, like it’s the first time they’ve ever seen a Black person. I still speak just as openly with anybody who wants to approach me. Of course, I don’t have Black Lives Matter on my vehicle, I don’t have it tattooed on my arm or put on my clothing. I just don’t want to have to put the crosshairs on my back like that.
I’m here in America. There is no shooting of Black people here in this town. But it’s all around me. The chances of it happening, well, when you only have four Black people, let’s hope it doesn’t happen. But if it does, I don’t think there’s going to be a rally. I don’t think there’ll be a riot. Because this is a small town, it’s going to be swept underneath the rug. It won’t even make the news.

SEATTLE
Dawn Dailey, 45
In the early months of the pandemic, Dailey was working out of a mutual aid tent, packing bags of snacks, water and hand sanitizer to give to homeless people in Seattle’s Cal Anderson Park. But that park became a battleground early last June, as protesters tried to set up an occupied zone and law enforcement cracked down .
I was out there and I wasn’t even protesting. I was just trying to help. There were protests there. And I was Maced in the face. And I feel like that was like one of the turning points for me to make the actionable decisions to be not just, you know, support.
I’m realizing that I can’t just be supportive, but I can help protect the protesters. Because I’m older, because I’m in my 40s. And I’m a mother.
It is not something I would have expected to have happened to me. I mean, I was a Sunday school teacher. I was an Army wife.
We had a protest as a Wall of Moms, with the overall Black Lives Matter protests. They were Macing us. And they were tear-gassing us directly in the face. I had been given a mask for my protection, and a hard hat. My hard hat was knocked off my head because a federal police officer threw a blast-ball explosive so hard at my head that it knocked my hard hat off my head. But I still kept on and I was just protesting, locked in arms with other moms, wearing yellow. I was in yoga pants and yellow, for goodness' sakes, that’s all I had on.
I totally felt my relationship with government change. I totally felt abused by the system that was there to protect us, and they were abusing us. And I had been part of the system, right?

ST. LOUIS
Tameka Stigers, 40
After Michael Brown was killed in 2014, Stigers wanted to join the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, just a few miles away. But understanding how that might have presented difficulties at work for her husband, a white police officer, she reluctantly stayed away.
Last May, we’re driving back from our little corona-break getaway and hear it on the radio. Then of course, we’re going to the phones and seeing the video like: Are you serious? This is what happened? I knew that I couldn’t stay quiet. I had to get out there and protest. And I told my husband: “You know what? I love you. I respect you. But I can’t sit still.” And he understood.
I had a spark of optimism: "Maybe we’re going to be on the verge of some spread of mass civil disobedience, and we’re going to get to a point where there will be some change."
My husband came, with my daughter, my sister — we all went and we marched. And it wasn’t until after marching that I’m like, “What change did I effect? What did I really show up to do? What did it mean marching down the street? What did that do?” I can’t say that it did much.
We still have police murders. I don’t know, I’m very conflicted. Part of me, I don’t want people to stop showing up. But I don’t know what it changes. I mean, there are times when people go down to the St. Louis County Jail, and they march. And then they just, just go home. They go home.
I feel like things, they’re getting worse. To truly get some change, I feel like there’s going to be another Civil War.
What are we really doing? What is it that we really want? The things we really want and desire and need, it seems like it’s damn-near impossible to have happen. So you just have to figure out how to gain some sort of leverage in your own small, little world where you are, and try to effect change there.

BOCA RATON, FLORIDA
Quinton Desamours, 19
A day after attending his first protest last summer, Desamours took a marker and wrote “BLM” on the face mask he planned to wear to work at a Publix grocery store. A store manager, citing corporate policy against messages on clothing, sent him home. Desamours tweeted about it and immediately became a national news story.
I was racking my brain all hours of the day trying to figure out like, “What do I do next?” I thought that if I didn’t do anything, you know, people were going to look at me as some kind of fraud or something. But my mom just continuously told me, “You don’t have to feel this pressure to carry the world on your shoulders.” She was like, “Sometimes you just make a statement, do what you need to do, and sometimes that’s the end of it.” She said, “Throughout history, you know, people build on what others have done.”
Going through something like that, there’s a piece of innocence that gets taken away from you that you can’t ever really get back.
You learn what’s right, and what’s wrong, as a child. But all of a sudden, now, when you get older, it’s like, “Aah, you know, politics. Business.” You’re not allowed to say this, you’re not allowed to do this, you’re not allowed to stand up for this, you’re not allowed to say what you feel, because you’re in this specific setting.
I think that that’s really the moment that I realized, you know, how to play that game in the real world.
You’re never going to beat it playing by your own rules. You have to get in there and get crafty. Not sacrificing your morals or anything like that, of course. But, you know, you just have to know how to play it.

NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE
Taylor Huestis, 28
Huestis, a banker, had already begun rethinking parts of the white conservative worldview that had surrounded him in his childhood. But his political conversion accelerated last June after he attended a massive march in Nashville, which was organized by six teenage girls.
I looked around, and I saw people that I recognized, people from high school and college, but then there were a lot of faces that were new to me. But listening to them speak — either in the speeches that they gave or just overhearing conversations in passing — I can tell that they are people who I had a much more extensive foundational agreement with than the people who would have been their counterpart at a Trump rally.
I actually went to the Trump rally when he came and spoke at Municipal Auditorium in, I think, 2015. He was this cartoonish figure, and he was saying these crazy things. But I wanted to see what the turnout would look like.
I definitely knew the people. These are the people I grew up with. These are my neighbors. These are my cousins. These are people I work with, people I went to school with.
I feel like the anger at the Trump rally was very, you know, “white replacement,” “the immigrants are going to come and take our jobs,” “they’re going to change all of the Christian values that you grew up with,” “everything that you know and love in America is going to change and be different.” And at the Black Lives Matter march, it wasn’t so much in anger, but like a righteous fury. Here we are again, virtually nothing’s changed. There’s still disproportionate policing in minority communities, the level of force against minorities is drastically higher.
I think the anger and the vitriol that is there at Trump rallies is just going to get overwhelmed by the youth movement that is coursing through America at the moment. The youth of the country, like these girls who organized this protest, gave me some pretty foundational hope for the future of this country.

SALEM, OREGON
Eleaqia McCrae, 20
One evening last May, McCrae and her sister decided to join a rally in downtown Salem. Two and a half hours after they arrived, the police tried to disperse the crowd, using tear gas and other munitions. McCrae was hit in the chest and the eye by what she said were rubber bullets, leaving her with lasting vision damage. (In court documents, the city has denied injuring her.)
It was just the worst pain I could ever experience. Despite the emergency room giving me medicine to try to stop the pain. It was unbelievably painful.
I have an appointment on Thursday, so I’m still doing this. It’s a lot of days, a lot of time. The doctor would take pictures of my eye every time and kind of hope that it was going to get better. I had this hole, from the damage and everything. And we’d watched in the picture: the hole, it looks OK, it’s staying the same. And then one week, he saw it getting worse. And then he says, “I don’t want to tell you this, but we are going to have to get surgery.” And I just look at this picture. It’s like this huge rip, a huge hole, everything looks just so out of place.
I literally was empty-handed standing there. And there’s no way to twist it to make it seem like I was a real threat. If that can happen while I’m trying to be there to just witness change then like, what else is there? If something so innocent can be met with such violence, I don’t know what there is to do.
Someone actually said something very beautiful to me. They said, “It’s good that you went because you took someone’s pain that night.” At first I was like, I don’t really know what to say to that. This whole time, I haven’t felt like what happened to me was empowering. I haven’t felt like I made a change. I haven’t felt that way at all. But when he said that, that I took someone’s pain that night, it just was like an eye-opener. That was going to happen to someone. It wasn’t anything I did. It wasn’t anything I could have controlled. I was there. I was Black. It was the police.

MINNEAPOLIS
Suud Olat, 31
A native of Somalia who spent the first 20 years of his life in a Kenyan refugee camp, Olat came to America in 2012. Three years ago, he became a U.S. citizen. Last year, he made an unsuccessful run for Minneapolis City Council. He was in the middle of his campaign when George Floyd was killed.
Huge debate, huge debate in most of the Somali community, especially the elders. They’ve been saying like, “You never know what will happen. You don’t have to protest. These police are deadly. So do not go to protest.” My mom, my dad, my family members, friends will tell you: “These police use grenades, they have all kinds of equipment that they have when they see the protesters. So do not go.” But I follow my guts and say, “You know, Suud, you can’t run for City Council for Minneapolis and watch videos of people protesting your city. No, no, no, you can’t do that.” Then I go.
I think I went to protests for the entire summer from May, June, July, I think all the way. Going to the governor’s mansion, going to the mayor.
We have our own, you know, problems with the police, too. Many still believe until something significant, something fundamental changes, this thing will continue. That’s what happened in May, this year, when Derek Chauvin was found guilty. That changed some perceptions. Because they think, “OK, this is the first. Maybe it will continue and the police will stop doing these things.”
Some people think, “These people are bringing more harm than good to Minneapolis, instigators are coming from outside Minnesota who are burning and looting those places.” But I believe I was doing the right thing, because protesting is a fundamental right. In some other countries, you cannot even protest. So those are some things that I do not take for granted.
There’s a system if you protest, and if you get arrested, you know, there’s a system that is a judiciary, an independent judiciary. But in other countries, executive, judiciary and legislators — they’re all the same. And you may get jail if you protest. In America, it’s been two years that I’ve been a citizen, and I’m running for office at the same time protesting day and night. And still I’m free.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
In 2019, Arthur Jafa won the Golden Lion award for best artist in the Venice Biennale for “The White Album.” A collage of found and original video, it mapped the psychology of Black-white relations in America today — the brutality, awkwardness and sometimes care. “Just as the film critiques a moment fraught with violence, in tenderly portraying the artist’s friends and family, it also speaks to our capacity for love,” the jury concluded.
Jafa was at his hotel, packing to leave town, when the news arrived. What surprised him was not that he had won, he told me recently; it was that the prize existed.
“I didn’t know there was an Academy Awards to the art thing,” he said.
Jafa was a creature of film, grizzled from 30 years working mostly as a cinematographer for other people, dating to “Daughters of the Dust,” in 1991, by Julie Dash, his spouse at the time. (Although the film made his reputation, with its poetic images depicting the Gullah community off South Carolina early last century, it did not make for a Hollywood career.)
He’s no longer the art ingénue. This season, Jafa (pronounced Jay-fa) has his first retrospective, at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, in Denmark, which gathers his video works since 2013, along with his sculpture, photography and binders of inspirational images going back to 1990. And he is showing new sculpture — chilly, brooding objects that give little away — at Gladstone Gallery’s Upper East Side branch in Manhattan, New York.
And then there is “Love Is the Message, The Message Is Death,” the seven-minute video poem that became the talismanic artwork of the Black Lives Matter era, particularly since the murder of George Floyd. Jafa’s cathartic treatment of race, violence and the miracle of Black culture, made in 2016, has been called the decade’s most “spellbinding” and “powerful” artwork; currently it stars in “Grief and Grievance: Art and Mourning in America,” the New Museum exhibition with a canonical energy.
And last June, when 13 museums — seven in the United States, six in Europe — wanted to show a single work on all their websites that, in their view, addressed the moment of mass protest against racism and police violence, it was “Love Is the Message” that they presented in a 48-hour-straight free screening.
Now, however, Jafa is complicating his story — subsuming “Love Is the Message” into his entire body of work in the retrospective in Europe and presenting sculpture in New York that is as tight and hermetic as the video was kinetic and loud. In so doing, he is bringing to the front darker, more personal themes — control, abjection, death — that elude social justice framings and that have concerned him all along.
“I’m an undertaker,” he told me. “I don’t do the uplift thing.”
We met on a Saturday at the Gladstone Gallery. Jafa is 60, a father and grandfather, with a suave, salt-and-pepper look. Friends and colleagues universally call him “A.J.” He had just arrived from Los Angeles, where he lives, but he readily settled into a long, meandering conversation.
The value of the multimuseum online screening, he told me, was its reach. “I took it as an opportunity because I never felt like Black people had a chance to see ‘Love Is the Message.’”
Still, he said, the work’s prominence — of which he was already wary, once noting that it seemed to bring white viewers a “microwave epiphany” — had grown limiting. “It’s something I’m proud of; it certainly changed my life,” he said. “But I’m a little embarrassed when it pops up again. I joke that it’s my ‘Purple Rain.’”
Jafa’s new sculptures will prompt no campfire rhapsodies. They are made of black industrial pipe and rail, vaguely softened by bits of cloth and ornaments. Some include a dark material he called “high-tech garbage bag.”
The pieces fairly seethe on their wall mounts. “They’re all pretty stark,” he agreed.
Gavin Brown, Jafa’s gallerist and now a partner at Gladstone, said the artist had hinted at this work, inchoately. “He’s been worrying these things a long time,” Brown said. “They’re fetish objects, in a really dark mood.”
What links Jafa’s art across mediums is the idea that items brought out of context and juxtaposed, whether metal pipes or appropriated YouTube clips, can develop expressive power beyond their original employ. It is precision work — obsessive microediting goes into the videos — that draws on a forager’s instinct for finding beauty in the ephemeral and mundane.
It invokes, as well, a particularly Black tradition — shaped by economic scarcity — of making art that transforms what is available. That impulse in Black creativity, in Jafa’s view, was a way to stake a claim in a largely hostile world. “It’s a form of radical determinacy in the face of the chaotic,” he said.
It connects, for instance, the craft of the DJ — an analogy he offers for his video work — with the yard sculptures he saw in Mississippi, where he grew up between Tupelo in the hills and Clarksdale in the Delta, and where “people just felt compelled to make” things.
“A commitment in A.J.’s work is the emphatic acknowledgment of the creative genius of regular Black people,” said Thomas J. Lax, curator of media and performance at the Museum of Modern Art. “Found material is a way of seeing what is genius about the way people use discarded matter, or in a gesture, how they walk down the street.”
Jafa’s sculptures, in that spirit, are mostly ready-mades — manufactured items given new context. Their lineage, Jafa said, dates beyond Marcel Duchamp to the African sub-Saharan masks and statues that, though alienated from their spiritual context, destabilized Western aesthetics and opened the road to Modernism.
In 2018, at Brown’s gallery, Jafa introduced his “Big Wheel” series — imposing 7-foot tires swathed in chains, one hanging from a gantry. From large speakers, Teddy Pendergrass ballads filled the space. Jafa told me he considers that installation his most successful. (It reappeared as part of his Venice entry).
I offered my reading of “Big Wheel,” which had mesmerized me — raising themes, I thought, of labor, manufacturing decline and the slippage between seductive and toxic masculinity. Sure, Jafa answered, but I had missed a significant reference: the circumstances of the car accident that paralyzed Pendergrass at the height of his career and in which his passenger, it was later learned, was a transgender sex worker.
Jafa had chosen the music on instinct, he told me, but then realized that his selection subconsciously drew on a body of discourse particular to Black America. “The Teddy thing is Black common knowledge,” he said. “This is why I say I’m not addressing white people in my work; I’m addressing Black folks, but everyone gets to listen in.”
For years, Jafa’s work has doubled as a kind of symposium, convening influential scholars in Black critical studies — among them Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten. They appear in his films (notably his 2014 documentary “Dreams Are Colder Than Death”), exchange with him in public talks, are his friends. The circle extends to fellow artists and filmmakers with whom he readily collaborates.
“The conversation and vibrancy of exchange are really formative of A.J.’s work,” said Leigh Raiford, an associate professor of African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley. “It’s the liveness, the improvisation of working out ideas in community that make the work so exciting and resonate with so many.”
A core concern of Jafa and his interlocutors is Black subjectivity as shaped by the trauma of enslavement and its long aftermath. Jafa is adamant that the disaster that set forth Black American existence is also foundational to Black creative genius and thus warrants unflinching examination. “I think we have an ethical imperative to mine the catastrophe,” he said.
But Jared Sexton, a professor of African American studies and film studies at the University of California, Irvine, who contributed to the retrospective catalog, said Jafa’s work equally “reveals the questioning that is always at the heart of Blackness.” Sexton added, “Blackness is like a productive enigma that yields the most necessary insights, so long as you never try to formalize them into a doctrine or dogma.”
What Jafa shows can disturb. His video sequences can move from the cosmic and transcendent — solar flares, ocean waves, gospel choirs — to the brutal and traumatic, including lynchings; killings by the police (like that of Walter Scott, in 2015, in “Love Is the Message”); surveillance footage of murderer Dylann Roof entering Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina (in “The White Album”).
Jafa’s sculpture from 2017, “Ex-Slave Gordon,” is a plastic impression of an 1863 photograph of an escaped slave, seen from behind, back violently scarred from whipping — but with a pose, hand on hip, that Jafa reads as dignified, cool. That image has fascinated Jafa since he was a teenager, he said. He has made it the cover of the retrospective’s catalog — impossible to avoid.
One gets the sense that Jafa, in his moment of triumph, is looking for trouble.
“One of my complaints has been that I’ve gotten very little pushback,” he said. “Including ‘Love Is the Message,’ which, you know, traffics in violence directed at Black bodies.”
Last year, over Zoom, he sparred with an elusive artist named Faith Icecold, who had excoriated him from a now-defunct Instagram account. Their conversation, in which Icecold calls Jafa anti-Black for his choices of imagery and his association with mainstream museums, is included in the catalog. Yet the criticism did not really move Jafa. “I’m insecure about certain things, but I know I’m not anti-Black,” he told me.
Today, Jafa is riding high. “It’s been a victory lap, basically,” he said. In addition to his art exhibitions, his film production company, Sunhaus, has several commercial features in development. He welcomes the success after years of career frustration; until recently, he said, “I was a failure, by and large, in my own mind.”
Yet his newest art projects stand in sharp contrast to “Love Is the Message” — at once more personal and harder to read. One pull is abstraction: His newest video, “AGHDRA,” on view in the retrospective, is entirely computer-generated; its motif is oceanic, with waves that swell yet seem made of fragments, like lava.
Another undercurrent in his work that receives less attention is the pull toward themes of sexual control and transgression, desire and degradation — sometimes involving himself. In 2018, for instance, he showed “La Scala” and “Man Monster — Duffy,” photographic self-portraits where he plays Mary Jones, an 1830s Black trans sex worker, wearing a corset and, in one, a leather vagina.
This year, also at Gladstone, he curated a show of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs that included plenty of explicit imagery. And his new gallery show, where the metal sculptures give off a distinct dungeon energy, also includes several photographs of his own — one frankly sexual, showing a flaccid penis, owner unidentified.
When I asked Jafa about this direction, he answered in two stages.
First, he said, it stemmed from a rebellious impulse. “It’s intransigent, punk, nihilistic, depressive, gothic.”
Then he followed the thought to a heavier place.
“Power relations and sexuality, for Black folks — these things always enter and are permeable with each other,” he said. He collapsed the history of coerced miscegenation going back to the plantation into a raw metaphor. “I can’t look at my face without seeing my rapist in the mirror. I don’t look like those Africans who came here.”
But Lax, the MoMA curator, said sexual pluralism in Jafa’s work also represents a connection with his creative community; he has collaborated, for example, with trans artist Tourmaline. “It’s about bringing himself into the room in a meaningful way, but not centering his own desires or identity,” Lax said.
Read this way, it’s a validation of everyone’s freedom. Jafa put it succinctly: “There’s an infinite number of positions to occupy.”
Jafa identifies the source of his unruly streak back in his Mississippi childhood, where, he said, the church was the institution that gathered and protected the community. But it was also hierarchical, and it enforced conformity. The dark, disapproved, material was expressed elsewhere, in the blues.
The people who sang the blues, he said, were prone to “despair, longing and heartbreak.” Yet in embracing the torment, they found tools to forge a kind of autonomy.
He has always recognized himself in that disposition. “I’m interested in fundamental change,” he said. “And I think fundamental change happens in the mud.”

More than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, slavery was abolished in Texas.
This June, Galveston will dedicate a 5,000-square-foot mural, entitled “Absolute Equality,” on the spot where Gen. Gordon Granger issued the orders that resulted in the freedom of more than 250,000 enslaved Black people in Texas. The Southern states refused to obey the Proclamation during the war.
The date of the Texas order was June 19, 1865, which is now celebrated around the country as Juneteenth (or Freedom Day, Emancipation Day or Jubilee Day). Some companies are recognizing the day as a paid holiday, and there are efforts to make it a federal one.
The mural “sprinkles the hard bitter truth with sugar,” said Reginald C. Adams, a Houston artist who was commissioned to create the art. “The sugar is the beauty and energy of the mural, while the bitter truth is that for two and a half years, people were held in slavery against a federal declaration.”
The theme of the brightly colored work is “absolute equality,” drawing from the words used in the General Order No. 3, which officially ended slavery in Texas. It reads, in part: “ This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.” The entire order is written at the bottom of the mural.
The mural includes the story of an enslaved Moorish navigator who was shipwrecked off the coast of Galveston in 1528, the first recorded nonnative slave to arrive in the territory, said Samuel Collins III, a historian and co-chairman of the Juneteenth Legacy Project. Many more would follow.
The mural moves on to Harriet Tubman and Lincoln, who is holding a chain with a broken manacle. And there is Granger seated, signing an order giving the Union control of Texas, which led to the Juneteenth order. Behind stands one white Union soldier and four soldiers from the United States Colored Troops.
The story told on the mural ends with a parade of people marching (including one in a wheelchair) and an astronaut with a clenched fist on his or her uniform — all of them moving toward the goal of absolute equality. It also includes a section with artwork by local young people.
“This is more than just a mural — it’s more than just paint on the wall,” Collins said. “I think this corner has been transformed into an outdoor classroom.”
The mural has some accompanying educational elements, including a written and spoken word poetry contest for middle- and high-school students and undergraduates in the Houston area explaining what “absolute equality” means to them.
Visitors will also be able to use their phone to scan portions of the mural to learn more, through augmented reality videos, about the stories portrayed.
Collins was the driving force behind the mural. Born in Galveston, he has researched Black history, particularly in Texas. Although there are commemorations of Juneteenth in Galveston — it was declared a state holiday in 1979 — Collins felt more was needed.
He read an article in The Galveston News by Sheridan Mitchell Lorenz, a philanthropist who lives in Austin but has deep ties to Galveston. In the piece, written shortly after the murder of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis, Lorenz noted that as a white woman, “I’m complicit if I don’t use my voice to acknowledge and speak out against systemic racism.”
Collins reached out to Lorenz about his mural idea because he liked her article, and knew that her family owned the retail space Old Galveston Square and adjoining parking lot.
That parking lot is where the Osterman building housing Union Army headquarters once stood and where Granger issued the order. And there was a huge blank wall. Collins proposed an idea to Lorenz: What about putting a mural there depicting the scene?
“I got chills thinking about that,” said Lorenz, as she recalled receiving Collins’ email. “I thought, ‘How come we didn’t think of that sooner — what an opportunity!’”
Lorenz donated the seed money. She now heads the Juneteenth Legacy Project with Collins, and the project received additional financing from a GoFundMe page and individual and foundation donors. At the same time, the project was gathering local government approval.
Adams seemed a natural choice to design the mural, Lorenz said, with his background in public art.
“This was the smoothest approval process I’ve ever experienced for a work of art,” Adams said.
Erika Doss, an art historian who has written about public art, called the mural and its related initiatives “a gigantic project,” adding that public art such as this one “has grown out of a very politicized moment.”
The goal, she said, is “creating something meaningful for a community that tells a different kind of history and gets people talking about history.”
Doss did note that murals often aren’t maintained and fade very quickly, but Lorenz said the project has built in fundraising for upkeep.
Not everyone is pleased with the mural. Collins said that he had heard some criticism that two white men — Lincoln and Granger — appear too prominently.
He understands that sentiment, but said he believes that “all these people were part of the story. There are people in the Confederacy who want it to be an all-white story, and those who are more Afrocentric that might feel it should be an all-Black story, but that’s just not our reality in America,” he said. “It took everyone to work together to bring this message of freedom, and it will continue to take all of us to try to achieve this absolute equality that we hope for.”
Collins also noted that Granger was deliberately portrayed as seated, with the four members of the United States Colored Troops standing over him “as men and patriots.”
Jeff Mahoney recently stumbled upon the mural while visiting from California. “The imagery is fantastic,” he said. It captures “celebration, but also skepticism” about the progress of racial equity. Mahoney, who was visiting the South for the first time, said he felt that the mural signifies hope “It shows change,” he said. “We need more of this.”

INDIANAPOLIS — On a breezy, 80-degree evening, the sun still in the sky, actor Chandra Lynch walked to the center of the Fonseca Theatre Company’s outdoor stage-in-the-round. At her back was a semicircle of oversized blocks, each with printed words that together formed the sentence “Blackness iz not a monolith.”
She turned to face a section of a dozen mostly white audience members, part of the sold-out opening night crowd of 50.
“White folks call what I’m about to do ‘exposition,’” she said, her mouth visible through a clear face shield. “But the Black folks in the audience know I’m about to preach.”
The Fonseca Theatre, located in a working-class neighborhood on the city’s west side whose actors are more than 80% people of color, staged its first show Friday night since its founder, Bryan Fonseca, died from complications of COVID-19 last September.
And not just any show — the world premiere of Rachel Lynett’s play “Apologies to Lorraine Hansberry (You Too August Wilson),” a metafictional meditation on Blackness that was recently selected as the winner of the 2021 Yale Drama Series Prize, one of the most prestigious awards for playwrights.
“This play allows us to just be 100%, unapologetically Black,” said Latrice Young, who plays Jules, a young queer woman who chafes at the regulations of her all-Black community. “There aren’t a lot of spaces outside the home environment where I can do that.”
Friday’s sold-out premiere, held in the theater’s parking lot, was the culmination of a nearly nine-month journey back to the stage after Fonseca’s death — and one of the first shows to be held in Indianapolis since the pandemic closed theaters across the country in March 2020.
It was far from easy. The theater’s 27-year-old producing director, Jordan Flores Schwartz, had to adjust to taking on a top-dog role she hadn’t been expected to assume for years. Then the comeback was pushed back by two weeks after rain delays put the theater behind on set construction — and two of the actors tested positive for the coronavirus four days before opening night.
“It’s been a journey,” said Schwartz, who is juggling her new role with coursework for a master’s degree in dramaturgy from Indiana University. “But there was never a question of whether we would continue. We had to.”
Theater for the Community
Fonseca had long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most daring producers in the Indianapolis theater scene. He co-founded the Phoenix Theatre in 1983, which became a home for productions that might never have found a place on the city’s half-dozen more mainstream stages.
His shows included Terrence McNally’s exploration of a group of gay men, “Love! Valour! Compassion!” — which attracted pickets — “Human Rites,” by Seth Rozin, which deals with female circumcision, and offbeat musicals like “Urinetown” and “Avenue Q.”
“His personal mission was to bring diverse work to Indianapolis, because he firmly believed we deserved that, too,” Schwartz said.
She and Fonseca had been a team since 2016, when he hired her at the Phoenix as a summer intern while she was working on her master’s degree in arts administration at the University of Oregon — one of the few paid internships available in the industry, she said.
And when he left the Phoenix in 2018 after 35 years following a dispute with the board, she became a collaborator on his next venture: the Fonseca Theatre Company, a grassroots theater in a working-class neighborhood that champions work by writers of color. The theater, which has an annual budget of roughly $180,000, still often plays to majority-white audiences, though Schwartz said the share of people of color who attend is growing.
Fonseca envisioned one day creating a community center in the building next door, with a coffee shop, free Wi-Fi, space for classes and gatherings, and laundry and shower facilities open to anyone.
“He really wanted to give the neighborhood a seat at the table,” said Schwartz, noting that 10% of the company’s audience members come from the surrounding Haughville, Hawthorne, Stringtown and WeCare communities.
Fonseca became one of the first producers in the city to resume performances during the coronavirus pandemic last July, when he staged a socially distanced parking lot production of Idris Goodwin’s “Hype Man: A Break Beat Play,” which centers on the police shooting of an unarmed young Black man.
“He always believed theater had the power to unite people,” Schwartz told The New York Times last summer. “He wanted to be part of the conversation around the Black Lives Matter protests.”
Fonseca took precautions, such as requiring masks and situating actors and audience members 6 feet apart, but “Hype Man” was forced to close a week early after one of the actors became ill. He was tested for the virus, but the theater declined to divulge the results, citing privacy.
Fonseca became sick in August, Schwartz said. He died a little over a month later, a few weeks after the theater wrapped a second production, Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm’s “Hooded, or Being Black for Dummies.” (She said it was unclear how he contracted the virus.)
He had already planned for the theater to take a hiatus, a decision that proved prescient when Schwartz, who had just begun her master’s program, took on the role of interim producing director.
There was never a question as to whether the theater would continue after his death, maintained Schwartz, who is Mexican American and Jewish and has long worked in community and children’s bilingual theater.
She began plotting a four-show outdoor season of ambitious plays by Quiara Alegria Hudes, Fernanda Coppel and Carla Ching, all women of color. One script in particular jumped out at her — Lynett’s “Apologies,” a play she’d first read in March 2020, and which seemed newly relevant in light of the racial justice protests and reckoning in the theater industry.
The play is set after a second Civil War, in the fictional world of Bronx Bay, an all-Black state devoted to protecting “Blackness.” Five residents debate what makes someone Black enough to live in their community — conversations that allow Lynett to emphasize that Blackness is not a monolithic experience.
But unlike “Fairview” or “Slave Play” — two works Lynett said she admires — hers is not aimed at white viewers. It’s about finding Black joy, she said in a video discussion hosted by the theater.
“What does it mean to be a Black woman who’s sexually assaulted onstage every night in front of a mostly white audience?” she added. “I wanted to write a play that really avoided the trauma.”
Just Getting Started
In April, the theater’s board voted to promote Schwartz to full-fledged producing director, Fonseca’s former role. And the company has raised about half of the $500,000 it needs to create the community center, which it hopes to begin construction on by the fall.
But the biggest milestone has already been achieved: returning to the stage.
The play’s ending, according to the script, is the most important part. It calls for the five actors to each answer the question, as themselves: “What does Blackness mean to you?”
On Friday night, Josiah McCruiston, whose character, Izaak, often supplies comic relief, picked up one of the blocks, labeled “Monolith,” and carried it to the center of the stage.
“I feel this play helps me scream at the top of my lungs about who I am,” he said. “That because I’m Black, I have a story, that I am rich, complex and deep. But I still think some white eyes will say I was funny.”
Aniqua Chatman, another actor, said, “I can say ‘Blackness is not a monolith,’ but I still feel the white stares looking at me.”
Then Chinyelu Mwaafrika said, “White people, raise your hands.” Thirty hands went up.
“I say racism, you say sorry,” he said. “Racism.”
“Sorry.”
“Racism.”
“Sorry.”
“Racism.”
“Sorry.”
With that, the play ended, and the chorus was replaced by applause.

From Protection to Reflection: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The morning in April before a Minneapolis jury found the former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd, Leesa Kelly woke up from a nightmare. As she had done many times over the past year, she cried out feelings of anger and hopelessness.
Kelly, who runs a self-help blog for women of color, had marched and helped fund-raise in the city since last May, when demonstrations erupted after Chauvin was captured on film pressing his knee into Floyd's neck, a deadly act that moved millions of people to march in what would be the biggest racial justice protests in decades.
But "nothing seemed to quell this feeling inside me: just deep despair and anger," she said. From that unsettled place emerged an idea that would become Memorialize the Movement, a project to preserve and exhibit the plywood sheets that business owners had affixed to their storefronts out of concern about vandalism by marchers, many of whom instead transformed the sheets into art: murals and other works inspired by the moment, applied in paint, spray paint, pen, pencil, marker and chalk. From May 21 to 23, many will be on view in a large-scale exhibition called "Justice for George: Messages From the People" in Phelps Field Park, steps from where George Floyd was killed.
Kelly recognized that the boards told a story -- of George Floyd's life and death, and how they reverberated across her community and the country.
"That's why it's so important that they be preserved," said Kelly, who had little connection with the arts world before this project. "Because this is Black history, and not just Black history, it's American history."
Motivated by a similar impulse, other groups in New York and Chicago are also gathering and transforming these symbols of unrest into objects that bear witness to a staggering year -- hoping to answer the question, in their own ways, of how to memorialize what their cities endured while stitching together a national portrait.
Minneapolis
Kelly, the group Save the Boards Minneapolis and volunteers have been collecting the pieces for nearly a year. Locating them and identifying their creators has been a scattershot undertaking. Some of the artists signed their often elaborate murals, adding their websites or Instagram handles, but others didn't know to sign their names or wanted to remain anonymous. Also, early on, Kelly didn't know what store owners had planned for their boards, or how receptive they'd be to having them collected.
Kelly passed around some quickly made fliers in mid-June and knocked door to door on major streets. "Most of these people had never had to board up their businesses, and they didn't know what to do with the murals," she said.
At first, it was just Kelly and her boyfriend, armed with a drill, gloves and a Jeep, hauling the boards, which are often eight feet tall and can weigh 60 pounds each. After recruiting volunteers mostly though social media, they have been able to gather more than 800 boards so far.
The collected plywood sheets have been stored in a climate-controlled space, and volunteers from the Midwest Art Conservation Center, a nonprofit organization for the preservation of art and artifacts in the Twin Cities, have since joined to help maintain their condition, including mitigating issues of moisture and mold that affected the flaky, brittle material. "We're just kind of going to let them live out their natural lives," Kelly said.
All the boards are also being digitally archived, with help from the urban art mapping team at the University of St. Thomas in the Twin Cities. The collection is expected to be accessible online by the end of the year.
Memorialize the Movement has longer-term plans after the show this month: to become a nonprofit, to establish a public memorial and to help the community learn about museum work and art handling. But those plans have been delayed by the death of Daunte Wright, a Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in April in Brooklyn Center, Minn., about 10 miles from where Chauvin was on trial.
"Now, as we look toward this exhibit that we're putting on to commemorate the life and death of one Black man who was killed, we have to think about how we incorporate this other Black man who was killed. And we have to think about what we're going to do for his anniversary next year," Kelly said. "It's just so much."
New York
Last June, the dual crisis of police brutality and the pandemic was in stark relief to Neil Hamamoto, the founder of Worthless Studios, a nonprofit that supports the creation of public art, while he was driving around Manhattan, which he does often to clear his head.
"The city was very quiet, most of SoHo was completely boarded up," said Hamamoto, who uses plywood material in his own art. "It just sort of clicked that all of these businesses were paying so much money to protect their windows, to protect the property inside, but what was going to happen to this material when they reopened? Where does this material go?" (During the peak protest months, a single board of plywood in New York cost more than $ 90, up from about $ 25 a board.) Hamamoto saw some wood on the street ready for disposal and decided to grab it, out of which grew the Plywood Protection Project.
Its aim, Hamamoto said, is to create safe, outdoor destinations for New Yorkers during the pandemic while prompting "emotionally and politically complex questions" around pain, anger, protest, property and memory. The place of national monuments in American history was top of mind, too, he said.
Worthless Studios collected more than 200 boards and initiated an open call for artists with the intention of selecting five. More than 150 applied. Those selected received studio space, tools, fabrication and installation assistance, along with a $ 2,000 stipend and a $ 500 material budget; the smallest installation required about 25 boards, while one of the larger works used closer to 60. This month, one sculpture was installed in each of New York's five boroughs.
In Manhattan, "Be Heard," by Behin Ha Design Studio, will be placed in Thomas Paine Park; "In honor of Black Lives Matter," by KaN Landscape Design and Caroline Mardok, will go up in Poe Park in the Bronx; "Migeulito," by Michael Zelehoski, in McCarren Park in Brooklyn; "Open Stage," by Tony DiBernardo, at the Alice Austen House in Staten Island; and "RockIt Black," by Tanda Francis, in Queensbridge Park in Queens. Most will be on view through Nov. 1.
Behrang Behin and Ann Ha, the founders of the architectural design practice Behin Ha Design Studio, whose contribution is a large-scale plywood megaphone, were drawn to the idea of working with materials that had played a role in socially and politically significant events. "As architects, we are accustomed to thinking of materials not just as physical matter used for construction, but also as existing in the cultural and social realms," the duo said over email. In that sense, they thought of the plywood boards as "cultural artifacts rather than interchangeable materials."
Francis has created several site-specific monumental public art pieces in New York, including "BIGGIE" (2014) and "Everyone Breaks" (2015-2016). Her work often addresses diasporic African people through large-scale masks and faces. She was home with her infant son when the events unfolded last spring and felt helpless that she couldn't participate. It was very stressful, she said, "to understand where the country was in their mind." And then this project came along. "OK, I have a direction, and I can use the actual material that was out of the streets and all that energy," she remembered thinking.
Her sculpture is in the form of a column and includes polished concrete and aluminum mirror -- "a stark black figure," she said, that will be topped with a shining beacon that will point east, toward the expansive Queensbridge housing projects.
"RockIt Black" will soon contain a digital component that Francis plans to add to over time. At first, it will likely be a QR code that will lead to a curated musical experience. Later, she hopes to include, among other things, a list of Black-owned businesses or projects, connecting visitors to "people who are advancing Blackness."
Chicago
In Chicago, efforts to transform these plywood boards have also been underway since last year, when, ahead of the election, a dozen voting registration booths were made from about 150 graffitied boards collected from storefronts around the city. The booths, collectively called "Boards of Change," were a partnership between local artists, the City of Chicago and When We All Vote, a nonprofit voting initiative chaired by Michelle Obama, Tom Hanks and Lin-Manuel Miranda, among others.
In the weeks leading up to the election, the booths were moved to different locations around Chicago and displayed in community meeting places like public libraries and galleries in neighborhoods with historically lower voter turnouts, mainly areas with a majority of Black or brown residents. Area leaders and artists spread the word.
The booths were designed by FCB Chicago, an advertising agency that partnered with Bobby Hughes, a Chicago-based craftsman, who helped construct them.
"Boards of Change" aimed "to bring the voices we heard during the George Floyd protests from the streets to the polls," said Perri Irmer, the C.E.O. of the DuSable Museum for African American History, where the booths are being stored. There are plans to exhibit the booths after the museum reopens, where they will serve as a reminder of the 2020 protests and as a tool for future elections; QR codes stamped on the booths will remain active, allowing visitors to register for midterm and presidential elections to come.
Many of the boards used to construct the booths came from the Paint the City project, founded by the curator Missy Perkins and the artist Barrett Keithley. Paint the City, which came together in June, rallied more than 60 artists to apply art to boarded-up storefronts in over a dozen neighborhoods, paying the artists and providing them materials. An exhibition of more than 100 of these boards is planned for this summer at the DuSable Museum.
Perkins and Keithley, who have known each other for nearly a decade, had already been painting alleys in the city to provide safer thoroughfares. When Covid-19 hit along with the George Floyd protests, they quickly pivoted to focus on the boards.
"We were out there when things were going down," Keithley said, recalling a few moments when clashes escalated around him while he was painting. But the demonstrators and police officers let him work. "I got a pass because I was putting up positive works of art," he said. "That came kind of like a stamp of approval."
"It was important because the time was important, plain and simple. They say artists speak to their time, and that's what we did," Keithley went on. "This is the medium that we chose to speak, and we were loud about it."

NEWARK, New Jersey — Dexter George, owner of Source of Knowledge, a bookstore on Broad Street here, wore a tool belt as he walked through aisles dotted with djembe drums and past walls lined with Ghanaian masks. Smoke coiled upward from a bowl of burning sage.
George, 56, has kept his business operating partly by practicing caution during the pandemic. Even when he opened his front door to start the workday, he kept the key in the inside lock; all customers who were allowed in were quickly directed to have their temperature taken and take a squirt of hand sanitizer. George eyed them through a hard plastic face shield.
“There’s a lot of people we aren’t seeing again,” he said. “This virus is going around in a circle until it gets everybody.”
George counted 30 customers killed by the coronavirus. Almost 1,000 people have died in New Jersey’s largest city because of COVID-19, and the vaccination rate remains below 30%. Throughout the pandemic, George considered not only safety concerns, but also the costs of closures and curfews. He weighed reduced foot traffic against his mortgage of $6,500 per month for the two-story building that houses his bookstore. On his commute, he noted roller gates that remained down and “For Lease” signs going up.
But George was not done building. Early in the epidemic, he created a GoFundMe page to alert customers to his status: “COVID almost killed us!”
Contributions revived him. While Black business ownership rates nationwide dropped 41% from February 2020 to April 2020 — the largest decline for any racial group — George watched as 1,200 patrons donated $69,211 to support his 30-year-old enterprise. Personal checks and civic grants further steadied the store’s finances.
Long unable to secure loans, he used some of the money to reinvest in his 2,700 square feet of retail space.
“At the end of the day, you only fit in a box,” he said of putting the money back into the store. “Can’t take it with you.”
By summer, he closed off half the store and planned an expansion. Sawdust mixed with incense as he knocked down walls, raised the ceiling, transformed an elevator shaft into an office and relocated the cash register from under the stairs. His second-floor tenant, Walm N’Dure, extended the fitness center he runs to the roof, configuring a rock-climbing course replete with netting and a retractable awning.
“It has always been a fight, up and down, a lot of mishaps,” George said. “Despite all of that, we always rise.”
George never expected to peddle wordsmiths’ wares. Born in Tobago, he grew up going barefoot and sleeping on floors. His grandmother was illiterate and his formal education ended after the fifth grade. At 17, he migrated to East New York with his mother, Brenda, and twin brother, Derrick. It was a hard transition. One morning, George woke up with a cold and told his mother he was going outside to find herbs in a bush, the place he typically went for natural healing methods, and boil them.
She laughed.
“I have to take you to a drugstore,” she said.
“What is at a drugstore?” he said.
“Medicine,” she said.
He worked as a welder until suffering a slipped disk in his back. He found purpose in selling books on sidewalks in Manhattan before saving money to open a bookstore across the Hudson. His first shop was on Branford Place, where he developed a reputation as reserved. On payday, Masani Barnwell, a kindergarten teacher in Newark, walked in to buy books for students in her classroom with characters that looked like the children in her classroom. She wanted them to be inspired and purchased copies of author Fred Crump’s series, which retells traditional fairy tales with Black characters. She saw a different side of George.
“He wasn’t that doggone quiet,” she said. “He approached me.”
While their romance grew, George gauged his next move. In 1998, tired of the drama that drifted into his store by Market Street, which had devolved into a high-crime area, he bought an abandoned building that had housed a jewelry store to serve as Source of Knowledge’s new base. Soon after, he traveled to Africa with Barnwell, and brought back African masks and other carvings. To diversify his offerings, he started selling tribal clothing and artwork. To help with his mortgage, he rented out his second floor to a series of tenants that included a bail bondsman, computer coders and the Nation of Islam.
Still, readers and researchers came for his eclectic catalog. In the children’s section, bibliophiles found “A is for Activist,” “Bippity Bop Barbershop” and “Yo Soy Muslim.” For adults, there was “The Destruction of Black Civilization” and “Bad Blood,” an account of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. In the business section, he displayed commemorative editions of “Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?”
A rollicking crew rolled through. Debates broke out; Mikey Spice’s reggae played. One night, Mayor Ras Baraka recited poetry on the second floor. When a couple inquired about getting married at the store, staff members decorated the space without charge. In lieu of gifts, guests bought books. The African tradition of broom jumping, which enslaved people performed in antebellum America, was incorporated into the ceremony.
“How could you charge for that?” said Patrice McKinney, a former customer who left corporate America to work at the store more than a decade ago.
The line between family member and customer often blurred. Ali McBride, 50, has been a patron since he was a teenager, buying books like “James Baldwin: The FBI File” and “Reciting Ifa: Difference, Heterogeneity and Identity.”
But McBride, around the time he retired from New Jersey’s Department of Corrections, went through a divorce that upended his life. Having sold his residence in order to ensure his mother was set in her Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, house, McBride needed a place to live. George invited him to stay in the basement of his home in East Orange, New Jersey.
“He didn’t open up a property to me,” McBride said. “He opened up his house. It blew my mind.”
George always welcomed white customers, but few came until last summer. After George Floyd’s killing by the police, George noted a rise in white visitors. They inquired about authors like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ibram X. Kendi. He preached consistency in supporting Black businesses.
“Don’t just do it because something traumatic happened,” he said. “It has been happening for years. Let’s have a dialogue.”
For quiet, George, who has battled anxiety since he lived in Tobago, retreated downstairs to complete his most fulfilling work: framing art. After teaching himself the craft and spending $100,000 on a joiner and cutters over the years, he has become a skilled framer. On the awning outside his shop, he advertised his services for one-hour custom services.
“When Amazon came in the market, I said, no, we cannot do books alone,” he said. “The books will put you out of business.”
One day in May, Nicole Sirju-Johnson, assistant vice president for diversity at Binghamton University in New York, and her husband, Jamar, perused framed paintings and masks in the store. The inventory ranged from stone statues to a painting of a Black man with an American flag wrapped around his neck as a noose to masks featuring elephants with upraised tusks. A black bull mask with gold accents was selling for $550 and paintings went for as much as $8,000.
Nicole Sirju-Johnson is from Brooklyn; her husband is from Harlem. They had just closed on a 4,000 square-foot Colonial and wanted to fill their walls with African art in Binghamton, New York, where the population is more than 70% white.
“There’s not many of us,” Nicole Sirju-Johnson said. Her husband added, “We want to treat them to get to know our culture.”
George smiled, aware of the ongoing gentrification around him in Newark and the guaranteed-income pilot program in a city where 27% of the population lives in poverty.
“I worship how little I have,” George said. “People are hungry. You have to help, be a model.”
George’s vision is to buy a van, build shelves in it and drive through Newark giving away books to children. Each week, he sets aside $50 for it. In the store, he plans to construct a juice bar to keep customers around longer. He wants students from across the street in Teachers Village schools to take field trips through his aisles.
With the pandemic waning — both George and McKinney have been vaccinated — and the weather growing warmer, more customers have started coming. On a recent afternoon, Jessica Molokwu, 25, walked down Treat Place toward Source of Knowledge’s back door. Along the way, the backs of buildings were colored with cultural history. There was a mural of Harriet Tubman holding a lantern next to the late graffiti artist Jerry Gant’s “Detox the Ghetto” motto. Molokwu ambled by a sign that George recently put up as a reminder of the struggles faced by Black entrepreneurs in the last century. It read: Building Black Wall Street.
Molokwu walked inside, breathed in the sage and told McKinney she was seeking information about her Nigerian heritage.
“Welcome home,” McKinney said.

The morning in April before a Minneapolis jury found the former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd, Leesa Kelly woke up from a nightmare. As she had done many times over the past year, she cried out feelings of anger and hopelessness.
Kelly, who runs a self-help blog for women of color, had marched and helped fund-raise in the city since last May, when demonstrations erupted after Chauvin was captured on film pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck, a deadly act that moved millions of people to march in what would be the biggest racial justice protests in decades.
But “nothing seemed to quell this feeling inside me: just deep despair and anger,” she said. From that unsettled place emerged an idea that would become Memorialize the Movement, a project to preserve and exhibit the plywood sheets that business owners had affixed to their storefronts out of concern about vandalism by marchers, many of whom instead transformed the sheets into art: murals and other works inspired by the moment, applied in paint, spray paint, pen, pencil, marker and chalk. From May 21 to 23, many will be on view in a large-scale exhibition called “Justice for George: Messages From the People” in Phelps Field Park, steps from where George Floyd was killed.
Kelly recognized that the boards told a story — of George Floyd’s life and death, and how they reverberated across her community and the country.
“That’s why it’s so important that they be preserved,” said Kelly, who had little connection with the arts world before this project. “Because this is Black history, and not just Black history, it’s American history.”
Motivated by a similar impulse, other groups in New York and Chicago are also gathering and transforming these symbols of unrest into objects that bear witness to a staggering year — hoping to answer the question, in their own ways, of how to memorialize what their cities endured while stitching together a national portrait.
Minneapolis
Kelly, the group Save the Boards Minneapolis and volunteers have been collecting the pieces for nearly a year. Locating them and identifying their creators has been a scattershot undertaking. Some of the artists signed their often elaborate murals, adding their websites or Instagram handles, but others didn’t know to sign their names or wanted to remain anonymous. Also, early on, Kelly didn’t know what store owners had planned for their boards, or how receptive they’d be to having them collected.
Kelly passed around some quickly made fliers in mid-June and knocked door to door on major streets. “Most of these people had never had to board up their businesses, and they didn’t know what to do with the murals,” she said.
At first, it was just Kelly and her boyfriend, armed with a drill, gloves and a Jeep, hauling the boards, which are often 8 feet tall and can weigh 60 pounds each. After recruiting volunteers mostly though social media, they have been able to gather more than 800 boards so far.
The collected plywood sheets have been stored in a climate-controlled space, and volunteers from the Midwest Art Conservation Center, a nonprofit organization for the preservation of art and artifacts in the Twin Cities, have since joined to help maintain their condition, including mitigating issues of moisture and mold that affected the flaky, brittle material. “We’re just kind of going to let them live out their natural lives,” Kelly said.
All the boards are also being digitally archived, with help from the urban art mapping team at the University of St. Thomas in the Twin Cities. The collection is expected to be accessible online by the end of the year.
Memorialize the Movement has longer-term plans after the show this month: to become a nonprofit, to establish a public memorial and to help the community learn about museum work and art handling. But those plans have been delayed by the death of Daunte Wright, a Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in April in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, about 10 miles from where Chauvin was on trial.
“Now, as we look toward this exhibit that we’re putting on to commemorate the life and death of one Black man who was killed, we have to think about how we incorporate this other Black man who was killed. And we have to think about what we’re going to do for his anniversary next year,” Kelly said. “It’s just so much.”
New York
Last June, the dual crisis of police brutality and the pandemic were in stark relief to Neil Hamamoto, the founder of Worthless Studios, a nonprofit that supports the creation of public art, while he was driving around Manhattan, which he does often to clear his head.
“The city was very quiet, most of SoHo was completely boarded up,” said Hamamoto, who uses plywood material in his own art. “It just sort of clicked that all of these businesses were paying so much money to protect their windows, to protect the property inside, but what was going to happen to this material when they reopened? Where does this material go?” (During the peak protest months, a single board of plywood in New York cost more than $90, up from about $25 a board.) Hamamoto saw some wood on the street ready for disposal and decided to grab it, out of which grew the Plywood Protection Project.
Its aim, Hamamoto said, is to create safe, outdoor destinations for New Yorkers during the pandemic while prompting “emotionally and politically complex questions” around pain, anger, protest, property and memory. The place of national monuments in American history was top of mind, too, he said.
Worthless Studios collected more than 200 boards and initiated an open call for artists with the intention of selecting five. More than 150 applied. Those selected received studio space, tools, fabrication and installation assistance, along with a $2,000 stipend and a $500 material budget; the smallest installation required about 25 boards, while one of the larger works used closer to 60. This month, one sculpture was installed in each of New York’s five boroughs.
In Manhattan, “Be Heard,” by Behin Ha Design Studio, will be placed in Thomas Paine Park; “In honor of Black Lives Matter” by KaN Landscape Design and Caroline Mardok, will go up in Poe Park in the Bronx; “Migeulito,” by Michael Zelehoski, in McCarren Park in Brooklyn; “Open Stage,” by Tony DiBernardo, at the Alice Austen House in Staten Island; and “RockIt Black,” by Tanda Francis, in Queensbridge Park in Queens. Most will be on view through Nov. 1.
Behrang Behin and Ann Ha, the founders of the architectural design practice Behin Ha Design Studio, whose contribution is a large-scale plywood megaphone, were drawn to the idea of working with materials that had played a role in socially and politically significant events. “As architects, we are accustomed to thinking of materials not just as physical matter used for construction, but also as existing in the cultural and social realms,” the duo said over email. In that sense, they thought of the plywood boards as “cultural artifacts rather than interchangeable materials.”
Francis has created several site-specific monumental public art pieces in New York, including “BIGGIE” (2014) and “Everyone Breaks” (2015-2016). Her work often addresses diasporic African people through large-scale masks and faces. She was home with her infant son when the events unfolded last spring and felt helpless that she couldn’t participate. It was very stressful, she said, “to understand where the country was in their mind.” And then this project came along. “OK, I have a direction, and I can use the actual material that was out of the streets and all that energy ,” she remembered thinking.
Her sculpture is in the form of a column and includes polished concrete and aluminum mirror — “a stark black figure,” she said, that will be topped with a shining beacon that will point east, toward the expansive Queensbridge housing projects.
“RockItBlack” will soon contain a digital component that Francis plans to add to over time. At first, it will likely be a QR code that will lead to a curated musical experience. Later, she hopes to include, among other things, a list of Black-owned businesses or projects, connecting visitors to “people who are advancing Blackness.”
Chicago
In Chicago, efforts to transform these plywood boards have also been underway since last year, when, ahead of the election, a dozen voting registration booths were made from about 150 graffitied boards collected from storefronts around the city. The booths, collectively called “Boards of Change,” were a partnership between local artists, the City of Chicago and When We All Vote, a nonprofit voting initiative chaired by Michelle Obama, Tom Hanks and Lin-Manuel Miranda, among others.
In the weeks leading up to the election, the booths were moved to different locations around Chicago and displayed in community meeting places like public libraries and galleries in neighborhoods with historically lower voter turnouts, mainly areas with a majority of Black or brown residents. Area leaders and artists spread the word.
The booths were designed by FCB Chicago, an advertising agency that partnered with Bobby Hughes, a Chicago-based craftsman, who helped construct them.
“Boards of Change” aimed “to bring the voices we heard during the George Floyd protests from the streets to the polls,” said Perri Irmer, the CEO of the DuSable Museum for African American History, where the booths are being stored. There are plans to exhibit the booths after the museum reopens, where they will serve as a reminder of the 2020 protests and as a tool for future elections; QR codes stamped on the booths will remain active, allowing visitors to register for midterm and presidential elections to come.
Many of the boards used to construct the booths came from the Paint the City project, founded by the curator Missy Perkins and the artist Barrett Keithley. Paint the City, which came together in June, rallied more than 60 artists to apply art to boarded-up storefronts in over a dozen neighborhoods, paying the artists and providing them materials. An exhibition of the more than 100 of these boards is planned for this summer at the DuSable Museum.
Perkins and Keithley, who have known each other for nearly a decade, had already been painting alleys in the city to provide safer thoroughfares. When COVID-19 hit along with the George Floyd protests, they quickly pivoted to focus on the boards.
“We were out there when things were going down,” Keithley said, recalling a few moments when clashes escalated around him while he was painting. But the demonstrators and police officers let him work. “I got a pass because I was putting up positive works of art,” he said. “That came kind of like a stamp of approval.”
“It was important because the time was important, plain and simple. They say artists speak to their time, and that’s what we did,” Keithley went on. “This is the medium that we chose to speak, and we were loud about it.”

WASHINGTON — Top House Republicans urged their colleagues Tuesday to oppose bipartisan legislation creating an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, positioning their conference against a full accounting of the deadly riot by a pro-Trump mob.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the minority leader, announced his opposition in a lengthy statement Tuesday morning, and his leadership team followed up later to recommend that lawmakers vote “no” Wednesday. Together, the actions suggested that the House vote would be a mostly partisan affair, highlighting yet again Republicans’ reluctance to grapple with former President Donald Trump’s election lies and their determination to deflect attention from the Capitol assault.
McCarthy had been pushing for any outside investigation to include a look at what he called “political violence” on the left, including by anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter, rather than focus narrowly on the actions of Trump and his supporters who carried out the riot.
“Given the political misdirections that have marred this process, given the now duplicative and potentially counterproductive nature of this effort, and given the speaker’s shortsighted scope that does not examine interrelated forms of political violence in America, I cannot support this legislation,” McCarthy said in a statement.
His opposition raised questions about the fate of the commission in the Senate, where Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to agree to support its formation. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, said he and other Republican senators were undecided and would “listen to the arguments on whether such a commission is needed.”
House Republican leaders had initially suggested that they would allow lawmakers to vote however they saw fit, too. But they abruptly reversed course Tuesday, releasing a “leadership recommendation” urging a “no” vote in an apparent bid to tamp down on the number of members embracing the bill.
Trump himself put out a statement Tuesday night, calling the commission a “Democrat trap.” He urged Republicans to “get much tougher” and to oppose it unless it was expanded to look at “murders, riots, and fire bombings” in cities run by Democrats.
“Hopefully, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy are listening!” he said.
In rejecting the commission, McCarthy essentially threw one of his key deputies, Rep. John Katko of New York, under the bus in favor of shielding Trump and the party from further scrutiny. Katko had negotiated the makeup and scope of the commission with his Democratic counterpart on the Homeland Security Committee and enthusiastically endorsed it Friday.
It was all the more striking coming just days after McCarthy had maneuvered the ouster from leadership of his No. 3, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, because she refused to drop criticisms of Trump and Republicans who abetted his election falsehoods. Cheney has said that the commission should have a narrow scope, and that McCarthy should testify about a phone call with Trump during the riot.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., immediately slammed Republican opposition as “cowardice” and released a letter McCarthy had sent her in February showing that Democrats had incorporated all three of his principal demands for a commission modeled after the one that studied the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
In it, McCarthy said he wanted to ensure any commission had an even ratio of appointees by Republicans and Democrats, shared subpoena power between the two parties’ appointees and did not include any “findings or other predetermined conclusions” in its organizing documents.
Democrats ultimately agreed to all three, but in his statement Tuesday, McCarthy said Pelosi had “refused to negotiate in good faith.”
“I presume Trump doesn’t want this to happen,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the majority leader. “Enough said.”
Katko predicted a “healthy” number of Republicans would still vote for it.
“I can’t state this plainly enough: This is about facts,” Katko told the House Rules Committee at a hearing on the bill. “It’s not about partisan politics.”
But by encouraging Republicans to vote no, McCarthy positioned the commission as yet another test of loyalty to Trump, spotlighting a rift within the party between a small minority that is willing to question him and the vast majority that is not.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, vowed to press the issue with Senate Republicans by quickly bringing the legislation up for a vote in that chamber.
“Republicans can let their constituents know: Are they on the side of truth?” Schumer said. “Or do they want to cover up for the insurrectionists and Donald Trump?”
McCarthy’s biggest complaint was the panel’s narrow focus on the riot itself — carried out by right-wing activists inspired by Trump — when he said it should take a broader look at political violence on the left, including a shooting by a left-leaning activist who targeted congressional Republicans at a baseball practice four years ago.
Some Republicans have gone much further in recent weeks, trying to whitewash the violence on Jan. 6 that left five people dead, injured 140 police officers and endangered lawmakers’ lives along with that of Vice President Mike Pence.
In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said a commission was needed to study “all the riots that happened during the summer of 2020 after the death of George Floyd,” not the attack on the Capitol. She also accused the Justice Department of mistreating those charged in connection with the attack.
“While it’s catch and release for domestic terrorists, antifa, BLM, the people who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6 are being abused,” she said.

There is a breathtaking moment near the end of the first episode of “High on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America,” a new four-part Netflix documentary based on the 2011 book by the scholar Jessica Harris.
The scene unfolds in Benin, a country that Harris has visited a dozen times in her work chronicling the connection between the foods of West Africa and the United States. She tenderly leads the series’ host, Stephen Satterfield, to the Cemetery of Slaves. The beachfront memorial marks the mass grave of thousands who died in captivity before they could be loaded into ships at one of the most active slave-trading ports in Africa.
Satterfield, a reserved 37-year-old who moved from a restaurant career to one in media, begins to cry. “I’m so glad I can tell them thank you,” he says. “And I’m so glad that finally, I get to bring them home with me. They get to come home.”
He breaks down into coughing sobs. Harris, nearly four decades his senior, holds him and reminds him to breathe. “It’s OK, sweetie,” she says. “Walk tall.”
The moment is the graceful heart of “High on the Hog,” a spiritual bequest from one generation of cultural guardians to another. The series, which premieres May 26, illuminates the resilience and ingenuity of Black cooks who have shaped American cuisine since the arrival of the first slave ships.
To say there has never been a food show like this is not a stretch. Historically, American food TV has largely reduced African American cooking to Southern or soul food. Even when it came to barbecue, producers favored white cooking personalities over Black ones.
“The way we talk, entertain, dress, create — all of that stuff has been recognized, but not our food,” said Adrian Miller, one of the historians featured in the series and who recently published “Black Smoke,” a book about African Americans and barbecue.
“High on the Hog” — the phrase refers to the location of the best cuts of meat on a pig but has come to connote wealth — marks a departure from the days when “all the Black folks on these shows were just caricatures,” said Tanya Holland, a San Francisco Bay Area chef and food TV veteran.
Holland, 55, polished her cooking technique in France and holds a degree in Russian language and literature. But that made no difference to television executives 20 years ago. “In 2000, when the Food Network cast me in ‘Melting Pot,’ they were like, ‘Can you do a brunch with your girlfriends sitting around going, ‘Hey, girl’?” she said. “Every show, they kept telling me be more sassy.”
“High on the Hog” is an overdue corrective.
The documentary is framed as Satterfield’s journey. It begins at the Dantokpa Market in Benin and ends at Lucille’s in Houston, where diners discuss Black culinary excellence over a meal that chef Chris Williams prepared for Toni Tipton-Martin from Tipton-Martin’s book “Jubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African American Cooking.”
In between, Satterfield travels to the Gullah Geechee rice belt in South Carolina, samples pepper pot made with oxtail in Philadelphia and visits New York to pay homage to Thomas Downing, king of the city’s oyster culture in the 19th century, and to the young shuckers carrying on his legacy. In Texas, Satterfield rides a horse (for the first time), goes to a Black rodeo and learns to make son-of-a-gun stew from offal the way the first Black cowboys did in the 1800s.
And in a segment that may change how a new generation views boxed macaroni and cheese, foodways teacher and historian Leni Sorensen re-creates an early-American version of the dish from a recipe developed by James Hemings, an exceptional French-trained chef whom Thomas Jefferson kept enslaved.
“It isn’t about the mac and cheese,” said Karis Jagger, one of the show’s producers. “It’s about survival, and showing how fantastic and brilliant some of these figures were who we just don’t know enough about.”
The seeds of the show were sown six years ago when food journalist Jeff Gordinier was reporting an article for The New York Times on African American cooking. Alexander Smalls, chef and co-owner of the Cecil, in Harlem, told him to read Harris’ book. Gordinier did, then told a friend, producer Fabienne Toback.
Toback read “High on the Hog” in one sitting — and she wept. She and Jagger, her longtime creative partner, were raw from the 2014 killing of Michael Brown Jr. by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and were looking for material that had more depth and meaning to them. They quickly asked Harris for the rights.
“She said yes to a couple of scrappy middle-aged Black women, and we were so grateful,” Toback said. “We wanted to make something grand, like she is.”
Harris called the women angels. “They were just hell-bent on getting it produced,” she said.
Although her work has been used for other projects, including the food programming and cafeteria menu at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, turning her book over to documentary producers was different. “It’s like giving your child up for adoption, and you have to trust the adoptive parents,” said Harris, who appears only in the first episode.
Although it took five years to turn what is essentially the first half of her book into a documentary, the timing of its release is perfect, Harris said.
“What we are seeing is extraordinary,” she said. “This is a social movement writ large, and food is a very big part of it.”
To acquaint themselves with new keepers of Black food culture to feature alongside established historians, the producers started their own food blog, "Hey, Sistah," and scoured the internet.
That led them to cooks such as Jerrelle Guy, a popular food blogger and photographer who wrote the 2018 cookbook “Black Girl Baking” (and who contributes to New York Times Cooking). In the documentary, as she creates desserts for a Juneteenth celebration, she has a tearful discussion with Satterfield.
“I feel like the kitchen is one of the safest spaces for me,” she tells him. “It gives me a feeling of empowerment, and I think that is really important for a lot of Black women who maybe don’t have a space like that.”
The series’ director, Roger Ross Williams, whose 2010 documentary, “Music for Prudence,” won an Academy Award, didn’t anticipate so many emotional moments.
“Each and every episode, we were moved to tears,” he said in a phone interview from Mexico City, where he is directing a feature film. “And it was not just a couple of people. There were moments when everyone was in tears. We felt the spirit every single day of shooting.”
“High on the Hog” was particularly meaningful for him. His mother died two months before production began. Although he was raised outside Philadelphia, his family is Gullah Geechee and settled in Charleston, South Carolina. He remembers visits to the Lowcountry as a child filled with farmwork and okra soup.
That’s why the okra soup that culinary historian Michael Twitty cooked over a fire near a slave cabin on a plantation in South Carolina was by far Williams’ favorite dish in the series.
“We know that food is an emotional thing for people, but I think it’s something completely different for African Americans because of all the pain we’re holding inside with our history,” he said. “But it wasn’t all sorrow and pain. There was great joy around the table for us as a family.”
As a food-show host, Satterfield is as introspective as Stanley Tucci is effusive or Anthony Bourdain was bold. Satterfield turned out to be exactly the host that the show called for, Williams said. Satterfield is well respected among people committed to social and political change through food, and he had no preconceived ideas about how to anchor a documentary.
“I would describe him as wonderfully green,” said Shoshana Guy, an NBC journalist who was the series’ showrunner. “When someone is green, it’s like an unpainted canvas.”
Satterfield, founder of media company Whetstone, had no idea he was being recruited when he met with Toback in Los Angeles. He simply thought she was asking for some help as they prepared to pitch the series to Netflix, which quickly embraced the project. When he realized they wanted him to host, he agreed immediately.
“Dr. J for me has always been an intellectual titan, a cultural titan,” he said, using a nickname for Harris. “The only thing I can liken it to is if you grew up idolizing Michael Jordan or LeBron, and now you are teammates.”
Satterfield, who recently moved from Oakland, California, back to Atlanta, his hometown, is trying not to worry about how the show will be received or the spotlight that will shine on him.
“When I think about what I want from the show, people’s imaginations being reconfigured is at the top of the list,” he said. “There’s a celebratory vibe to this show that feels like an arrival. It feels like a victory for so many of us. It has that emotional quality of liberation.”

North Carolina Prosecutor Calls Shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. ‘Justified’

A North Carolina prosecutor said Tuesday that the fatal shooting of a Black man in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, by local sheriff’s deputies was justified, because the man, Andrew Brown Jr., used his car as a “deadly weapon” as he tried to evade arrest. The deputies will not face criminal charges, he said.
R. Andrew Womble, the district attorney for North Carolina’s 1st Judicial District, made the announcement in a news conference Tuesday, during which he described Pasquotank County sheriff’s deputies’ efforts to serve a drug-related warrant on Brown and showed snippets of police body camera video from the brief, deadly encounter.
The facts of this case, Womble said, “clearly illustrate the officers who used deadly force on Andrew Brown Jr. did so reasonably, and only when a violent felon used a deadly weapon to place their lives in danger.”
Three deputies opened fire on Brown as he tried to get away in his car on April 21, firing 14 shots. His death, just days after a jury found a Minneapolis police officer guilty of murdering George Floyd, another Black man, sparked days of peaceful protest in Elizabeth City, a majority-Black city of 18,000 people on North Carolina’s eastern coast.
The family of Brown and their lawyers, who saw some video footage of the shooting earlier, have described it as an “execution,” arguing that deputies overreacted by opening fire on a man who was trying to get away from them, not hurt them. They said a private autopsy showed that he was hit by five bullets and killed by a shot to the back of the head.
But Womble said Tuesday that Brown, at one point, drove his car “directly at” a deputy, giving the officers the legal right to open fire. Womble said an official autopsy showed that Brown was shot twice, including in the head, during an interaction that took a total of 44 seconds.
The prosecutor said that after the deputies arrived at Brown’s house to serve the warrant and surrounded him while he was in his car, Brown put the vehicle in reverse. At that point, Womble said, Sgt. Joel Lunsford, who had his hand on the driver’s side door handle, “was pulled over the hood of Brown’s vehicle, where his body and his safety equipment were struck by the vehicle.”
Womble said that Brown ignored deputies’ commands to stop, continued to back up and then put the car in drive. At that point, Lunsford was “directly in front of the vehicle,” Womble said, and Brown drove directly at him.
“It was at this moment that the first shot was fired” by sheriff’s investigator Daniel Meads, Womble said. It went through the front windshield. Then multiple shots rang out.
The prosecutor said that a bag with a substance containing what is believed to be crystal methamphetamine was found in Brown’s mouth by the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy.
The officers, Womble said, were “duty-bound to stand their ground, carry through on the performance of their duties, and take Andrew Brown into custody. They could not simply let him go, as has been suggested.”
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, had asked Womble to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, as have lawyers for the Brown family. Womble said Tuesday that a special prosecutor was not accountable to the people of North Carolina’s seven-county 1st Judicial District. “I am,” he said.
In August, the American Bar Association adopted a resolution calling on local governments to pass laws that require the appointment of an independent special prosecutor to look into cases involving lethal force used by law enforcement.
“Prosecutors often consider police officers to be their teammates and may fear that prosecuting an officer will result in other officers refusing to testify in their other cases,” the resolution said.
Ronald Wright, a professor of criminal law and criminal procedure at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said Womble’s decision most likely ended the possibility of any state-level criminal prosecution of the officers.
But he said that Womble’s decision does not prevent the Brown family from pursuing civil litigation. He also noted that there is a federal investigation of the shooting by the FBI, which is working with federal prosecutors and the civil rights division of the Justice Department.
That investigation could potentially include exploring whether the deputies deprived Brown of his constitutional rights by using excessive force.
“You can hope that the DOJ can come in,” said Sellers, the lawyer for the Brown family. “Unfortunately, that may be our last hope.”
Womble’s description of the police body and dash camera footage was starkly different from the description offered by Brown’s family and members of their legal team, who had been given two occasions to see some of the footage.
“We did not see any actions on Mr. Brown’s part where he made contact with them or try to go in their direction,” said Chance D. Lynch, a lawyer who reviewed about 20 minutes of the recordings with family members this month. “In fact, he did just the opposite.”
A slow-motion review of the footage from the news conference by The New York Times’s Visual Investigations unit shows that after deputies surrounded Brown’s car with weapons drawn, he appears to clip an officer when he reverses briefly.
Brown then drives forward, toward the same deputy, and tries to drive away between him and a second, appearing to try to avoid hitting them while driving across a vacant lot. As he appears to be directing the car away from the deputy in front of him, who briefly places his left hand on the hood of the car, an officer fires the first shot, according to the Times review.
A local judge delayed the public release of the body camera videos, citing concerns that their release could compromise the investigation. The decision angered demonstrators and family members who said members of the public should have the right to see the recordings and decide for themselves whether the shooting was justified.
Although Womble showed portions of the video on Tuesday, he said he was not authorized to release the full footage publicly.

NEW YORK — Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the state’s highest-ranking House Democrat, is throwing his support to Maya Wiley in the race for mayor of New York City, a significant endorsement at a critical juncture in the race.
The decision by Jeffries, who is chair of the House Democratic Caucus and represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens, comes at an inflection point both for Wiley and in the volatile race more broadly, nearly five weeks before the June 22 primary that is likely to decide the next mayor.
“This is a change election, and Maya Wiley is a change candidate,” Jeffries, who could become the first Black House speaker, said in an interview Saturday afternoon.
Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, is fresh off an assertive debate performance in which she repeatedly sought to put Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, on the defensive. Adams and Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate, have generally been regarded as the two leading contenders, with Wiley trailing in the sparse public polling available.
Still, she has acquired a number of notable endorsements, including the backing of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. An endorsement from Jeffries, coupled with her debate performance and the start of her advertising campaign, may bolster her efforts to introduce herself to voters and to gain steam in the final weeks before the primary.
“Maya’s life experiences, if she can get out and tell that story, will be particularly compelling,” Jeffries said. “An African American woman who lost her father at a very young age but rallied back from that adversity to follow in her father’s footsteps as a civil rights champion is a quintessential change candidate.”
Jeffries appeared with Wiley on Sunday at Restoration Plaza in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. He said he intended to engage in significant efforts on her behalf, with hopes to campaign with Wiley as well as with Reps. Yvette Clarke and Nydia Velázquez, who have also endorsed her candidacy.
Notably, those three lawmakers, who all represent slices of Brooklyn, did not side with Adams, a fellow elected official and a veteran of the borough’s politics. Their endorsements of Wiley may be seen as blows to Adams as he seeks to consolidate his own support. Adams and Jeffries have found themselves on opposing sides of a number of political battles over the years.
Asked about some of those dynamics, Jeffries said that “my respect and relationship with Eric Adams at the present moment is a strong one, and I wish him the very best.”
Wiley, one of the more left-leaning candidates in the race, said she had heard from Jeffries on Friday night, adding that he, along with Clarke and Velázquez, were “leaders whose constituents trust them, respect them, and they move votes.”
“To have Hakeem Jeffries standing up with me saying, ‘This is my candidate,’ is hugely impactful in a critically important part of this city to win for anyone who wants to be mayor of New York City,” she added.
In the June primary, New Yorkers will be able to rank up to five mayoral candidates, and Jeffries indicated that he might reveal other rankings of his choices for mayor but said he had not yet reached a decision on how he would proceed.
On Sunday, Michael Vachon, a spokesperson for billionaire philanthropist and liberal megadonor George Soros, indicated that Soros would be giving $500,000 to a pro-Wiley effort, citing the endorsement from Jeffries. Wiley once worked at Soros’ charitable foundation.
“In light of her commanding performance in the debate and Congressman Jeffries’ endorsement, we have decided to join with 1199 to make sure Maya’s message for NYC isn’t drowned out by the super PACs supporting men in this campaign,” he said.
In the interview, Jeffries sketched out a detailed map of what he saw as Wiley’s path to victory — though certainly, with a crowded field of candidates, there is significant competition for every major political constituency in New York.
“I expect that Eric Adams and Maya Wiley will perform the best in the communities of central Brooklyn as well as in other traditionally African American neighborhoods throughout the city of New York,” Jeffries said, going on to note Wiley’s potential in “both traditionally African American communities” and parts of the city that are home to many white liberals, mentioning neighborhoods like Chelsea, in Manhattan, and progressive Brooklyn enclaves.
“That’s a pretty powerful electoral pathway, if the campaign can continue to put it together over the next few weeks,” he said.
Some rival Democrats have feared the prospect of a late surge from Wiley, and the coming weeks will test her ability to execute on that possibility.
“Every day I will be out to speak, and we will be making sure that our message is getting out both on television and on radio,” she said. “People are starting to turn their attention to this race in earnest, and we’re going to make sure they know who I am and what I stand for and what I’m going to do.”
Jeffries said that at a policy level, he was drawn to Wiley’s promises to lead an equitable economic recovery coming out of the pandemic. Wiley, a civil rights lawyer, speaks often of “reimagining” New York, a city marked by significant racial and economic inequality.
“Those communities who have been hurt the most in terms of an economic crisis have often been helped the least,” Jeffries said. “Those communities that have been hurt the least have often been helped the most. It seems to me that Maya Wiley is the person to make sure that this time will be different.”
In recent weeks, issues of violent crime have moved to the forefront of the mayor’s race, amid a significant spike in shootings and a number of high-profile attacks in the subways. Adams and Yang have been especially direct about the role they believe the police can play in restoring calm, even as they also support combating police misconduct.
Wiley released a plan to combat gun violence months ago. But she has also supported reallocating $1 billion from the New York Police Department’s funding “to fund investments in alternatives to policing,” her campaign said. And she has resisted the idea of adding more police officers to patrol the subways, breaking with the two perceived front-runners during the debate on that issue as she emphasized the importance instead of empowering mental health professionals.
The next mayor, Jeffries said, must strike “the right balance between promoting public safety and promoting fairness and justice in policing.”
“It seems to me that Maya Wiley gets that we have to do both,” he said.
Jeffries said he had reached his decision after extensive conversations with candidates, others in the New York congressional delegation and constituents.
His mother did not wait to see where her son would land, telling Wiley weeks ago that she was on board, NY1 reported.
“My mom totally got out ahead of me on that one,” Jeffries said. “Far be it from me to break publicly from my mom.”

NEW YORK — New York City’s annual Pride celebration, which began 51 years ago as a defiant commemoration of an anti-police uprising and has evolved into a city-sanctioned equality jamboree, will take steps to reduce the presence of law enforcement at its events.
Starting this year, police and corrections officers will also not be allowed to participate as a group in the annual Pride march until at least 2025. The ban includes the Gay Officers Action League, an organization of LGBTQ police, which announced the news in a statement Friday night.
The New York Police Department will also be asked to stay a block away from the edge of all in-person events, including the march. Heritage of Pride, which organizes events, will instead turn to private companies for security and safety, calling police officers in emergencies only when necessary, they said.
The decision, which organizers announced Saturday, follows years of pressure from some LGBTQ activists, who have maintained that law enforcement was out of place at a march with roots in the 1969 anti-police riot outside the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan. It also comes after similar decisions in other cities around the country.
The president of the Gay Officers Action League, Brian Downey, criticized the decision as exclusionary, calling it “shameful” and an “abrupt about-face” in a statement.
“Their response to activist pressure is to take the low road by preventing their fellow community members from celebrating their identities and honoring the shared legacy of the Stonewall Riots,” Downey said.
The decision by Pride organizers reflects shifting attitudes toward policing in the city and the growing pressure on city institutions to address long-standing complaints about diversity and inclusion.
Mainstream LGBTQ organizations have for decades been criticized for prioritizing the concerns of some groups over others, with transgender people and people of color saying the push for progress has often left them behind.
“The issue is, how do we make Pride safe for the people who feel the most marginalized and have often been left out of the conversations about how Pride is run?” said Beverly Tillery, executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, an LGBTQ rights group.
In the case of NYC Pride, the changes are meant to address concerns voiced by some transgender, Black and Latino people who say they felt unsafe marching in front of a police force that routinely targeted and victimized them.
NYC Pride had previously resisted demands to sever its ties to the police. Calls for change escalated last summer after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the nationwide protests against police brutality that followed.
“The community really called us out as an organization,” André Thomas, one of NYC Pride’s co-chairs, said. “Because they felt that we weren’t necessarily living up to our mission, our higher ideals and standards.”
The changes will not be felt immediately. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have shifted most of their programming online. Although the march this year will have an in-person component, it will be much smaller in scale, a far cry from the ornate floats and hordes of spectators in the past.
Law enforcement will also not disappear entirely from future Pride events and their fringes. Officers are required to provide some security for public events, and because the Police Department issues some event permits, organizers will maintain a relationship with the police.
“The idea of officers being excluded is disheartening and runs counter to our shared values of inclusion and tolerance,” a Police Department spokesperson, Sgt. Jessica McRorie, said. “That said, we’ll still be there to ensure traffic safety and good order during this huge, complex event.”
The step to reduce the role of policing marks a shift in the debate over the spirit of Pride events and whom they serve. As celebrations in major cities have grown, some have worried that they have left their protest-driven origins behind.
“We as an organization started as a response to police brutality,” Thomas said. “So we definitely need to be cognizant and aware of that.”
From the inception of the modern LGBTQ movement, its relationship with the police has been fraught. The rebellion at the Stonewall Inn in 1969, one of the major catalysts for the movement, was set off by a police raid.
When thousands gathered in New York City in 1970 a year later in a rally to commemorate that day, they worried that officers might attack them along the route. Their fears that day were for naught, but anti-LGBTQ attitudes persisted in the Police Department for decades.
As the event grew — acquiring colorful corporate displays, enormous crowds and support from city leaders — the number of police officers stationed along the route ballooned. Gradually, they went from being seen as would-be antagonists to security partners.
They also began to participate more actively in events. When gay police officers first marched in uniform in the parade in 1996 — they sued for the right to do so — it was seen by many as a victory.
“GOAL and our members have had our hands in every police reform and policy revision touching on the LGBTQIA+ community in New York City,” Downey said in his statement.
But even as views have shifted, the uneasiness over the presence of law enforcement at Pride has remained, particularly among Black people and transgender or gender nonconforming people.
“As the police presence at Pride has grown over the years, the members of our community who are most marginalized, who are most harmed by police, have felt like Pride is not a safe place for them,” Tillery of the Anti-Violence Project said.
The Anti-Violence Project runs a 24-hour hotline for LGBTQ people to report incidents of violence. In past years, workers consistently received calls during Pride celebrations from people reporting harassment or altercations involving “the very police who are supposed to be protecting them,” Tillery said.
Activists, including members of the Anti-Violence Project, have reported these incidents and concerns to Pride organizers. They pointed to other cities that barred uniformed police officers from their parades and called on New York to do the same.
As recently as 2019, organizers resisted. The tension in part led to the creation of the Queer Liberation March, which does not allow officers in uniform. At last year’s event, the police clashed with protesters, who said that officers used pepper spray on them.
Thomas, the Pride co-chair, said that organizers had long thought of themselves primarily as event producers and viewed the Police Department as “more of a safety measure.”
But the national reckoning over race and policing that began after the killing of Floyd generated internal discussion over Pride’s long-standing relationship with the police.
At the same time, community groups like the Anti-Violence Project were making another concerted push to reduce the Police Department’s presence at Pride.
“A lot of the community just kind of made it obvious that we needed to take a different stance regarding these issues,” Thomas said.
After town halls with community members and discussions with activists, Heritage of Pride opted to adopt an approach in which they use police officers as a last resort.
Pride organizers have committed to seeking out private security companies committed to inclusion. They will also work to train companies on best practices for interacting with LGBTQ and minority communities, Thomas said.
Heritage of Pride also said it would provide de-escalation training, which seeks to defuse potentially confrontational encounters, to its volunteers.
David Johns, executive director of the National Black Justice Coalition, said organizers had opened the door to change but that they needed to hold themselves accountable.
“These kinds of shifts are necessary and difficult,” Johns, who has advised Heritage of Pride, said. “And when they’re done, they are often not accompanied by the kind of support that holds people through the process over time.”

NEW YORK — On the day after the leading Democratic candidates for mayor faced off in the first major debate of the election season, Andrew Yang attended a conference on the future of the waterfront. Scott Stringer went to a vacant lot in Brooklyn to talk about affordable housing. Maya Wiley toured a Puerto Rican cultural center on the Lower East Side. Eric Adams attended fundraisers, and Ray McGuire greeted business owners on Staten Island.
But whatever the candidates’ ostensible agendas, public safety, which spurred some of the hottest exchanges during the debate — remained the topic of the day, after yet another rash of attacks in the subway kept the city’s focus on its shaken sense of order.
And so there was Adams, a retired police captain, reminding New Yorkers in a statement Friday morning that he stood with transit workers in their demands for more officers in the subway. There was Yang on “Good Morning New York,” opining that the police “are going to drive our ability to improve what’s going on our streets, in the subway.”
There, on the other side of the divide, was Wiley, at the Clemente Cultural and Educational Center in Manhattan, urging that more social service workers for people with mental illness, not more police officers, be sent underground.
And there was Stringer, the city comptroller, sounding a similar note in front of the vacant lot in Brownsville, saying that without a comprehensive prescription that includes social services and supportive housing, “We will be cycling people from the subways to Rikers,” the city’s jail complex, “back and forth and at a tremendous financial cost.”
With less than six weeks left before the June 22 primary and a crowded field of contenders struggling to define themselves to a distracted electorate, crime, and how to stop it, has emerged as both a dominant public concern and a way for the candidates to score points against one another.
Each day seems to bring a fresh cause for alarm. On Friday, a group of men slashed or punched commuters aboard a moving subway train. The attacks came at the end of a one-week stretch that included the shooting of three bystanders in Times Square, a police officer being shot three times while responding to another shooting and at least a half-dozen other seemingly random subway attacks.
The candidates have clearly felt pressure to address the violence. After the Times Square shooting last Saturday, Yang, Adams and McGuire held news conferences there, even as the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, stayed away.
At the debate, Adams took Yang, a former presidential candidate, to task for holding a news conference “blocks from your home” in Times Square but not responding to recent shootings in neighborhoods with large Black populations, like Brownsville. Two other candidates, Shaun Donovan and Kathryn Garcia, responded to the Times Square shooting with plans to get guns off the streets.
In many ways, the campaigning on Friday was a continuation of the previous night’s debate, where the candidates leaned into their sharply different approaches to law enforcement and to the question of whether the city can police its way out of a spike in gun violence.
Wiley, a civil rights lawyer and former counsel to de Blasio, said at the debate that she would take $1 billion from the Police Department and use the money “to create trauma-informed care in our schools, because when we do that violence goes down and graduation rates go up.”
Another candidate, Dianne Morales, who has called for cutting the $6 billion police budget in half, said that “safety is not synonymous with police.” Stringer and Donovan have also called for shifting at least $1 billion from the police budget to social services.
Garcia, a former sanitation commissioner, staked out a middle ground on Thursday, saying, “We do need to respond when the MTA says we need more cops in the subway. That does not mean we’re not sending mental health professionals into the subway as well.”
Adams and Yang have opposed “defunding” the police, and on Thursday night Adams repeated his call for a reinstituted unit of plainclothes police officers to target gang activity in the city.
“​We have to deal with intervention,” he said, “and stop the flow of guns into the city,” adding, “We have to deal with this real, pervasive handgun problem.”
In one of the debate’s fiercer exchanges, Wiley called Adams an apologist for stop-and-frisk policing. That prompted him to counter that he was actually a “leading voice against the abuse of stop-and-frisk” and that Wiley had showed a “failure of understanding law enforcement.”
Wiley retorted that as the former head of the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, “I certainly understand misconduct.” Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, hit back, saying that under her, the board was “a failure.”
Wiley picked up the thread Friday, reminding a reporter at her tour outside the Clemente Center that Adams had called stop-and-frisk a “great tool” just last year. (She called the policy “lazy,” “ineffective” and “traumatizing.”)
Adams also took flak from Donovan at the debate for having said that as mayor he would carry a gun.
“As a New Yorker but also as a parent, I’m deeply concerned about the idea of a mayor who carries a gun at a time where gun violence is spiking,” Donovan, a former city and federal housing official, said.
Adams replied that he would do so only if the police’s threat assessment unit found that he was the target of “a credible threat.”
On Friday, Wiley spoke about there being a “false choice between either being safe from crime and being safe from police violence” and promised, “We can have both.”
In an ad released on Friday by a political action committee that supports Adams, Strong Leadership NYC, Adams used similar words.
“We can have justice and public safety at the same time,” he says in the ad, adding that after being assaulted by the police as a young man, he became an officer with the goal of reforming the department from within. In his statement on Friday, Adams called not only for more officers in the subway but for “serious mental health resources.”
Still, there was no question where his emphasis lay: He also called for better monitoring of security cameras and closer coordination between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, and the police.
“Progress cannot be derailed by crime,” Adams wrote. “If New Yorkers themselves cannot rely on our public transportation to keep them safe, then tourists will not return and not the businesses that depend on them.”

WASHINGTON — House Democrats pressed ahead on Friday with a bipartisan proposal to create an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, after reaching agreement with a key Republican to drop his party’s demand that it look at left-wing violence unrelated to the assault.
But it was not clear whether GOP leaders, who have insisted any such inquiry study Black Lives Matter and antifa, a loose collective of anti-fascist activists, would go along with the deal. The uncertainty raised the prospect of a showdown in the House next week over the investigation and the Republican Party’s reluctance to reckon with the deadly attack on Congress by a pro-Trump mob.
The proposal agreed to by the top Democrat and Republican on the Homeland Security Committee would provide Congress with a nonpartisan, governmentwide accounting of what led to the riot and hampered the response by law enforcement, as well as recommendations to prevent a repeat. Modeled on the commission that studied the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the body would deliver its findings by Dec. 31.
“Inaction — or just moving on — is simply not an option,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who reached the agreement with Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y. “The creation of this commission is our way of taking responsibility for protecting the U.S. Capitol.”
The proposal could break a partisan logjam that has persisted for months over the composition and mandate of such a commission. But Republican leaders in the House and Senate did not immediately say whether they would support it.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the minority leader, said shortly after the announcement that he had not signed off on Katko’s plan and still needed to review its details. A spokesman for Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, declined to comment.
Still, the announcement of a compromise suggested that Democrats were prepared to simply go around most Republicans in the House if need be. That would force GOP lawmakers to choose between embracing an investigation of a riot inspired by Donald Trump, which is likely to anger the former president and alienate their constituents who revere him, and opposing an accounting for the deadliest attack on the Capitol in more than 200 years.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would vote next week on the legislation creating the proposed panel. At the same time, she plans to move ahead with a vote on a long-awaited bill that would provide $1.9 billion to bolster the Capitol’s defenses, reimburse the National Guard and other law enforcement for protecting the complex in the attack’s aftermath and cover costs related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Republican leaders have not yet endorsed the spending measure either, calling it premature. But Democrats believe holding a prompt vote will force GOP leaders to the negotiating table.
The measure's provisions include more than $500 million to reimburse the National Guard, which has supplied thousands of troops to patrol the newly fortified Capitol; $350 million to create retractable fencing and new security screening sites at the complex, $160 million for hardening windows and doors; more than $175 million to protect federal judges and courts, and $40 million to fund prosecutors going after suspected Capitol rioters.
It includes smaller pots of money to equip Capitol Police officers with body cameras and increase protection of lawmakers as they travel the country. Many of the initiatives were recommended by a panel led by Russel Honoré, a retired Army lieutenant general appointed by Pelosi to investigate Capitol security.
The Capitol Police promptly issued a statement saying the funding would “help the department move forward to meet our evolving mission.”
The pair of measures, and the protracted deliberations surrounding them, underscored just how significantly the violence has rattled and reshaped Congress in the months since the riot occurred, including by worsening its partisan divisions.
The attack was one of the most violent in American history. More than 140 police officers were injured, at least five people died in connection with the riot, the vice president and members of Congress had to flee for their lives and the Capitol building itself was badly damaged. And initial reviews by congressional committees and other government watchdogs have already turned up troubling evidence of avoidable intelligence and security failures that made matters worse.
Proponents of a bipartisan commission argue that putting outside, nonpartisan experts in charge of the fact-finding will improve the investigation and help calm partisan nerves. Some senators, whose after-action hearings on the attack have been bipartisan, feel the need for another inquiry is less urgent.
“An independent, bipartisan commission will remove politicization of the conversation and focus solely on the facts and circumstances surrounding the security breach at the Capitol, as well as other instances of violence relevant to such a review,” Katko said in a statement.
Katko is among the most moderate House Republicans and was one of 10 in his conference to vote to impeach Trump in January for inciting the insurrection. His position mirrored that of another of the 10, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who Republicans purged from their leadership ranks this week for her vocal repudiations of the former president’s election lies and her party’s complicity in them.
She said that Republicans did not want a narrow investigation into Jan. 6 because it “threatens people in my party who may have been playing a role they should not have been playing.”
“I am very glad that they rejected Leader McCarthy’s suggestions that somehow we should dilute the commission,” Cheney told ABC News on Friday, adding that McCarthy “absolutely should” testify before the body about a phone call he had with Trump as the attack was underway.
But the two Republicans appear to be in the minority. Many of the party’s loudest voices have undertaken a concerted campaign to downplay the Capitol riot and deflect attention from it by pointing to the unrelated actions of activists aligned with movements on the left.
Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, offered the latest example on Friday, when he took to the House floor for an hourlong speech that argued that the rioters — who smashed windows, clubbed police officers and threatened to hang former Vice President Mike Pence that day — had essentially been peaceful.
Gohmert accused the Justice Department of abusing its power to harass and punish conservatives who had come to stage a nonviolent protest that day, while “going easy on the looters and destroyers in Portland.”
“The overwhelming number of people caught up in this, quote, unprecedented investigations, as the Justice Department promises — they’re actually nonviolent, peaceful Americans,” he said. “Their only crime was supporting Donald Trump and concern about the fraud Democrats have been telling us about in elections for many years.”
The denialism have left Democrats furious and flummoxed over how to respond. One of them, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who served as an impeachment prosecutor against Trump, started asking colleagues on Friday to support a resolution censuring a handful of the Republicans who had been most outspoken in misrepresenting the Capitol attack.
The deal struck by Katko also included concessions from Democrats. After pushing for an agreement that would have given their party more power to choose who would serve on the commission, they accepted a 50-50 split in which each party would appoint five of the 10 members. Subpoena power would likewise be shared between appointees of the two parties.
But it does not allow the commission to look at events beyond Jan. 6 in the way some Republicans had insisted. Instead, the panelists would be tasked with examining “the facts and causes relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex” as well as “the influencing factors that fomented such attack on American representative democracy while engaged in a constitutional process.”

When the doors reopen at the National Gallery of Art on Friday, visitors may be surprised by new changes to this Washington museum’s look. Some 20 clashing typefaces and confusing signage have been gradually disappearing from the building, replaced by a new logo visible inside and out, and a new mantra — “Of the nation and for all the people”— that will appear on its website and be shared with staff. The museum says this vision statement, developed through meetings with employees, symbolizes a renewed commitment to diversity, inclusion and excellence.
“I was hired with a clear mandate from the board to put the national back in the National Gallery of Art,” Kaywin Feldman, who became the museum’s first female director in 2018, said in a recent Zoom interview.
The branding campaign, which the museum said would cost around $820,000, is the National Gallery’s first attempt in the more than 80 years since its founding to establish a public identity. The plan also indicates how Feldman intends to shape the institution two years into her tenure — a period that has included pandemic closures, calls for an investigation into allegations of sexual and racial harassment, and a controversial decision to postpone an exhibition of Philip Guston’s paintings.
Visual changes created by the design firm Pentagram include a new typeface by Frere-Jones emphasizing the word “National” in boldface. (It reflects the font used for donor names carved into the institution’s marble walls.) AEA Consulting, which advises museums on strategic planning, also helped gather input from museum staff during more than 100 meetings to create explicitly stated goals.
“The National Gallery is seeking to boldly come into the 21st century,” Darren Walker, a museum trustee who also leads the Ford Foundation, said in a telephone interview. He added, “Diversifying the collection is among the trustees’ top priorities.”
Although the National Gallery was established as the American public’s art collection, its holdings do not represent the country’s current demographics. Statistics provided this week by the museum show that the collection is nearly 92% male and 97% white (for works where the artist is known). As part of a new commitment to diversify the collection, in December the museum acquired paintings, quilts and sculptures by more than 20 African American artists, many of them self-taught. Recently, it added a textile by Christopher Myers that memorialized Black victims of police violence.
In the interview, Feldman addressed how the National Gallery has navigated through the Black Lives Matter movement and the uncertainties of COVID-19, describing the museum’s reopening as “a moment of rebirth.” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Reimagining the National Gallery’s identity is the first major project of your tenure. What do you hope this project conveys about the museum’s future?
A: Our new vision statement, “Of the nation and for all the people,” is rooted in the National Gallery’s history. When we were founded, Andrew Mellon made a gift to the United States and was very clear that he didn’t want the building or museum named after him. He wanted it to be of the nation and for the people. Those words help set our future path, determining our values going forward, because we still have a lot of work to do catching up with the rest of the country and what the nation really looks like.
Q: What is the museum doing to make the collection better reflect the American population?
A: Our core collection does mirror the demographics of America when we were founded in 1941, when the country was almost 90% white. But we have our work cut out for us to expand representation. At my first board meeting, I told the trustees that it’s not feasible or thoughtful to only collect Euro-American artists when it comes to contemporary art, for example, because today’s artists are so global — artists live, work, and have studios in different countries and often different from the place in which they were born. But at the same time, at this point in our history, it doesn’t make sense to go backwards and become an encyclopedic museum.
Q: You have spoken about the need to listen to staff members of color. How are you committing to diversity within the museum’s programming and leadership?
A: I inherited a leadership team that was 100% white, and now it’s 57% people of color. We have just hired E. Carmen Ramos [from the Smithsonian American Art Museum] to be our chief curator and conservation officer. She is the first woman and first person of color to hold that position. We hired our first curator of African-American and Afro-Diasporic art. [Eric L. Motley, who is Black, also joined in March as deputy director of the National Gallery; he had served as a special assistant to George W. Bush.]
We have added seven exhibition projects and installations to the schedule representing women and people of color, including an exhibition in fall 2022 of Native American contemporary art curated by Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, who will be the first artist to curate a show for the National Gallery.
Q: Last year, several current and former employees wrote a public letter alleging sexual and racial harassment. Can you explain how the museum has addressed those concerns?
A: We have hired a chief diversity, inclusion, and belonging officer, Mikka Gee Conway. She is putting in place a series of programs including training. And during the Derek Chauvin trial, we brought in a counselor and hosted some voluntary listening and healing sessions for staff.
Q: During the pandemic, there has been a loosening of rules prohibiting institutions from selling artworks from their collections, allowing them to use proceeds to cover operational costs. You described deaccessioning at a conference as “the wrong answer to the wrong question.” What issue did you want to address?
A: Museums are undercapitalized. Most of the 20th century was about growth, but our funding models and endowments never kept pace. I have experienced the strain during times of crisis. I was director of the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art during the financial crash of 2000. If you could have told our board we could sell art, they would have done it in a heartbeat. But because I could say we have professional ethics to follow, we ended that conversation. As a policy, the National Gallery does not deaccession.
Q: The National Gallery has been closed longer than most major museums in the country. As you reopen its doors to the public, what are you most looking forward to presenting?
A: We have been thinking about the murder of George Floyd and how we represent African Americans. The Shaw 54th Regiment Memorial [by Augustus Saint-Gaudens] inside the museum does not traditionally list all the names of men in the African American military unit during the Civil War (although we do list it on our website). We are going to include their names in the gallery. We are also looking forward to presenting acquisitions from Souls Grown Deep in summer 2022.
During the pandemic we managed to conclude the capital campaign we started five years ago. The Mellon Foundation challenged us to raise $45 million and they would give us $30 million for the endowment. We raised just shy of $50 million, That’s going to be $80 million to help us improve our digital offerings and support the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts.
To reopen — and this time I’m assuming for good — is really a moment of feeling like the phoenix rising.

Andrew Brown’s Family Is Shown More Video of His Killing by Deputies

Full text: Enlarge this image.
ATLANTA — Family members of Andrew Brown Jr., the Black man fatally shot last month by North Carolina sheriff’s deputies, on Tuesday were given a second opportunity to view body and dash camera footage of his killing.
After viewing a redacted but more extensive chunk of the recordings, they and their legal team came to the same conclusion they had before: The footage, they said, did not show Brown threatening, or even making contact with, law enforcement officers as he tried to flee in his car as deputies attempted to detain him.
This account of events does little to resolve the two very different versions of what the recordings of the episode — which have not been made public — purportedly show. In an April 30 court hearing, R. Andrew Womble, the local district attorney, said that the video footage he reviewed shows Brown’s car making contact with deputies as he tried to drive away.
This contention is potentially crucial to any case against the three Pasquotank County sheriff’s deputies who shot at Brown on April 21. Their fate may hinge on the question of whether Brown’s manner of driving posed a credible threat to their safety.
Brown’s family members viewed the footage privately Tuesday afternoon in a government building in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, a majority-Black city of about 18,000 residents where Brown, who had a history of drug-related arrests, grew up and lived. Protesters there have taken to the streets, repeatedly and peacefully, to denounce the shooting, calling it an act of police brutality, and demanding that officials make public the full two hours of body and dash camera video.
In North Carolina, however, such videos can be released to the public only with a judge’s approval. At the April 30 hearing, Judge Jeffrey B. Foster agreed with Womble that the footage should not be immediately released, citing, among other things, concerns about the integrity of the ongoing investigation.
But Foster allowed the family to privately view about 20 minutes of footage recorded by a dash camera and several body cameras as deputies sought to serve drug-related warrants on Brown.
The faces of deputies were blurred out in the videos shown Tuesday to the family members, who had previously been invited by county officials to view a 20-second snippet from one body camera.
At a news conference after Tuesday’s viewing, Chance D. Lynch, a lawyer who reviewed the recordings with the family, said that the six videos they watched did not show Brown making contact with any deputies as he tried to flee from his home in his BMW sedan.
“We were able to see where they possibly reached out to make contact to him,” Lynch said of the deputies. “But we did not see any actions on Mr. Brown’s part where he made contact with them or try to go in their direction. In fact, he did just the opposite.”
Lynch said that what he saw squared with the 20-second snippet viewed five days after the shooting by the family and another lawyer, Chantel Cherry-Lassiter, who said at the time that the video clip she saw showed Brown’s “execution.”
According to Lynch, the videos he saw Tuesday showed Lynch’s hands visible as deputies engaged with him. When the deputies arrived on the scene, Lynch said, they were yelling different commands to Brown. “Some of them were saying, ‘Show your hands,’ another was saying, ‘Get out,’ ” he said.
A shot was fired, Lynch said, at which time Brown, 42, put his car in reverse, placing him “several feet if not yards away from the police who were there.” Brown then turned his car away from the officers, Lynch said.
“At no point did we ever see any police officers behind his vehicle,” he said. “At no point did we ever see Mr. Brown make contact with law enforcement.”
As Brown turned to go across a yard by the side of his house, Lynch said, a second shot was fired. Brown, he said, picked up speed, making tracks in the turf, while the police began “unloading their weapons.”
“There were so many shots that we found difficulty in counting the number of shots that his vehicle received,” Lynch said. “At some point there was a final shot, where it appeared that at that final shot Mr. Brown lost control.”
The car then traveled across the street and hit a tree.
No weapons were found in the car, Lynch said. “My friends, I would suggest to you that it was absolutely and unequivocally unjustified,” he said of the shooting.
In an email Monday, Womble, the prosecutor, said he would not be commenting further on the body camera footage “until I reach a charging decision,” because doing so could run afoul of state bar association rules.
The slaying of Brown came just a few days after a jury found a former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, guilty of murder in the case of George Floyd, an African American man who spent minutes with his neck under Chauvin’s knee.
Sheriff Tommy Wooten II of Pasquotank County said that the three deputies who opened fire on Brown would remain on administrative leave pending the completion of the investigations into the episode.
The FBI is conducting a civil rights investigation. The State Bureau of Investigation is also investigating, and will present its report to Womble, who will decide whether to present the case to a grand jury.
Wooten had asked the court to make the videos public in the spirit of transparency. So had a group of news organizations, including The New York Times. Foster ruled that the media organizations did not have standing under state law to request the release of the video.
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, has asked Womble, to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, as have lawyers for the Brown family.
Khalil Ferebee, Brown’s son, spoke briefly at Tuesday’s news conference, his eyes shrouded by sunglasses. He said the more extensive video footage told a story similar to the one that he saw in the 20-second snippet days ago.
“What’s in the dark is going to come to the light,” he said.

After a Traumatizing Year, Black People Turn to Therapy

In the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, mental health experts across the country say they have seen African Americans, whose skepticism of therapy has been documented by research, seeking it in growing numbers.
Jamil and Sara Stamschror-Lott, the founders of Creative Kuponya, a mental health practice in Minneapolis just minutes from where Floyd, a Black man, was killed, said the demand for therapy had “gone through the roof” over the past year. The couple said 31% of their practice’s clients are Black.
“We’ve seen everything that the nation has seen from afar, from folks in civil unrest and devastation, despair,” said Jamil Stamschror-Lott, who is Black. The couple said that some residents were overwhelmed and exhausted by the events of the past year and that there remained a “great deal of pain and trauma.”
Researchers have often found a hesitancy toward therapy among Black people. A 2013 study found that they were not very open to acknowledging psychological problems and were concerned about stigma, especially Black men. In 2007, researchers called the underuse of mental health services among Black people a “serious concern.”
That skepticism is part of a broader mistrust of the medical establishment by Black people, whose illnesses are more often misdiagnosed compared with other groups, researchers said. Historically, groups of Black people have been exploited by the federal government for medical studies. Black patients also tend to receive lower-quality health services, including for cancer, HIV, prenatal care and preventive care, according to research.
However, there are signs of changing cultural attitudes toward seeking mental health treatment.
Douglas E. Lewis Jr., a clinical and forensic psychologist in Decatur, Georgia, said he was seeing more Black people willing to seek therapy now than in the past.
“I think people are starting to see therapy for exactly what it’s always been, which is more of an insight, building, more of an opportunity to see things in a different perspective, reframing,” Lewis said. “It’s something that everyone could benefit from, not just people who may be diagnosed with a severe persistent mental illness.”
Lewis said some Black people were experiencing a form of “shared trauma” as a result of the news media’s coverage of the Floyd case and other high-profile police shootings, sometimes resulting in increased anxiety or nervousness.
“We’re being inundated with these things repeatedly,” he said, “and what I think increases and compounds these issues is that Black Americans in the United States already experience difficulties that seem to be linked to race already in their daily lives.”
Racism, economics and parenthood are sometimes topics of discussion for Str8 Mental, a virtual group that provides a space for Black men nationwide to discuss issues affecting their lives, said Brad Edwards, the community organizer for Dear Fathers, a platform that tells stories of Black fatherhood. Str8 Mental meets monthly, and sessions, which allow at least 30 participants, are led by two Black male therapists.
“Oftentimes as Black men, because we have not been taught to open up and discuss what we’re dealing with, we often think we’re dealing with those things alone,” said Edwards, who is Black. “These guys are really forming bonds. It’s purely strangers coming together, being an open, vulnerable safe space and pouring into each other.”
Edwards said Str8 Mental started nearly a year ago and was born out of the effects the pandemic had on the Black community.
“We created this just to have an opportunity for guys to come and start to unpack,” he said. “I think that the talks around therapy and therapists has started to become more and more common in the Black community” over the past couple of years.
At least 700 men have participated, he said.
A string of large pharmacy chains have recently entered the mental health market. Since January, CVS has added licensed clinical social workers trained in cognitive behavioral therapy in more than a dozen locations, and Walmart and Rite Aid are working to provide similar services.
In addition, there has been a growing chorus of celebrity voices advocating for mental health treatment, including actress Taraji P. Henson, who started a foundation to eradicate the stigma around mental health issues in the Black community.
Lewis said that he was pleased by the recent crop of programs and discussions around normalizing therapy in the Black community but that more needed to be done.
“We should all be working toward maintaining our mental health,” he said, “particularly when we’re facing increased visibility of police aggression seemingly without any justice.”

Four former Minneapolis police officers were indicted on charges of violating the civil rights of George Floyd, a Black man whose killing last year led to months of demonstrations against police violence, the Justice Department announced Friday.
The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury weeks after one of the officers, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Floyd. The charges are another extraordinary censuring of law enforcement officials, who rarely face criminal charges for using deadly force.
The indictment charges Chauvin, 45, and other former Minneapolis Police Department officers Tou Thao, 35, J. Alexander Kueng, 27, and Thomas Lane, 38, with willfully depriving Floyd of his constitutional civil rights during his arrest.
The indictment alleges that by holding his left knee across Floyd’s neck and his right knee on his back and arm as he lay on the ground, handcuffed and unresisting, Chauvin used unconstitutional, unreasonable force that resulted in Floyd’s death.
Thao and Kueng were charged with willfully failing to stop Chauvin from using unreasonable force. All four defendants saw Floyd lying on the ground in need of medical care and willfully failed to aid him, depriving him of his constitutional right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, which included Floyd’s right to be free from an officer’s deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, the indictment said.
A second indictment also charged Chauvin with depriving a teenager of his civil rights during a September 2017 encounter in which the former officer is accused of holding the minor by the throat and striking his head multiple times with a flashlight.
Chauvin held his knee on the neck and the upper back of the teenager, even after the child lay prone, handcuffed and unresisting, and that resulted in injuries, the indictment said.
The latest charges are separate from the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department that Attorney General Merrick Garland announced April 21. And they are separate from the state charges against Thao, Kueng and Lane.
In recent years, the Justice Department has opened civil rights investigations into high-profile assaults and killings of Black people by police officers, but the inquires have rarely resulted in charges against officers in part because the standard for the federal charge — that in the course of policing, an officer willfully deprived a person of civil rights — is a high bar to meet.
It can be difficult to show that an officer willfully intended to deprive people of their civil rights, former lawyers in the Justice Department’s civil rights division have said. Prosecutors argued against charging Daniel Pantaleo, the officer involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, in part because they said that Pantaleo’s intent in putting Garner in a choke hold was unclear.
“Willfulness is the highest intent standard under criminal law — that the person set out to act with the purpose of depriving someone of their rights,” said Jonathan M. Smith, a former official in the Justice Department’s civil rights division who now serves as executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.

NEW YORK — It was a heart-rending killing in a summer of overwhelming grief: Davell Gardner, a 1-year-old boy sitting in his stroller last July during a nighttime barbecue in Brooklyn, was shot in the stomach after two gunmen hopped out of an SUV and opened fire on the gathering.
Davell died at 2:30 the next morning and became the city’s youngest gun violence victim last year, two months shy of his second birthday. The shooting, captured on surveillance video, jolted a city already beaten down by the pandemic and roiled by unrest over police brutality.
On Thursday, 10 months later, police announced charges against two men in the killing. One is accused of being the gunman and is also charged in connection with two other murders, and the other is accused of being the driver.
Dashawn Austin, 25, who is accused of being the gunman, was among 18 young men facing murder, conspiracy and weapons charges in a 63-count indictment unsealed Thursday morning in Brooklyn, which detailed the violent gang feud behind the killings.
Austin and the other defendants are members of the Hoolies gang, which has been engaged in a bloody rivalry with the 900 gang in Bedford-Stuyvesant, according to the Brooklyn district attorney’s office. The conflict has left at least six people dead, 14 wounded and many others fearing for their safety in the neighborhood since 2018. Nineteen members of the 900 gang were charged in January.
In a major breakthrough, police obtained Hoolies group chats on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, where members plotted shootings and alerted one another about rivals in the neighborhood.
Investigators also pieced together hours of surveillance footage, including identifying unique items of clothing that members wore, and gathered intelligence around the Hoolies headquarters in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
At a news conference Thursday, Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, said he had spoken with Davell’s parents before the charges were announced.
“I hope today’s indictment and accountability will be a small measure of solace for the family as they seek justice,” he said.
Police officials believed Thursday’s takedown targeted the leaders of the Hoolies, including some founding members, but they said the gang still had dozens of recruits. Prosecutors are working with community advocates to address concerns about the arrests potentially unleashing a violent succession battle among younger Hoolies seeking to fill the leadership void.
Much of the violence occurred over the last year amid a historic surge in shootings that has left New York and many other cities reeling. The Police Department recorded 1,531 shootings in 2020 — almost double the 777 recorded in 2019 — and Davell was one of 468 people killed, the most since 2011.
Shootings have continued their sharp rise this year, jumping to 416 through May 2, from 227 over the same period last year, an 83% increase, according to police statistics. Murders have increased slightly. The violence has become a key issue in the mayor’s race as the city struggles to mount an effective response.
The takedown was one of two gang operations announced Thursday, as federal prosecutors in Manhattan brought racketeering and weapons charges against seven people believed to be members and associates of the 800 YGz in the Bronx.
Police and prosecutors say that gang investigations allow them to bring more serious charges against a small number of people who are responsible for most of the violence in the city.
But some lawyers and researchers say the authorities take credit for tackling crime while scapegoating gangs and using aggressive policing practices that sweep up large numbers of young Black and Hispanic men.
Babe Howell, a law professor at the City University of New York, has closely studied four indictments charging a total of about 200 people since 2014. She said the cases show how law enforcement officials often highlight an “exaggerated narrative that holds whole groups responsible for the conduct of individuals.”
“What we see is cases that are solved basically using cooperators who are facing sentences based on conspiracy charges that could mean 20 or more years,” she added. “It’s so worrisome because there’s no other world where we bring in all your friends for something you did three years ago.”
The young men charged in the Hoolies and 900 gang takedowns, who range in age from 16 to 33, dueled through rap songs posted on YouTube and in tit-for-tat shootings, according to prosecutors. Many of the shootings involved victims who were innocent bystanders or were mistakenly believed to be rival gang members.
The feud escalated on the afternoon of Dec. 4, 2018, when the Hoolies leader, Jahlil Grant, 21, was shot in the neck and killed in front of the Roosevelt Houses where the gang operates. Investigators believe the 900 gang was behind the shooting.
Eight hours later, prosecutors said, the Hoolies retaliated and killed a man walking in front of the Sumner Houses nearby — 900 Gang territory. The victim, Tyree Walker, 35, was not involved in the feud between the Hoolies and the 900. He was shot in the back of the head by assassins he never saw, the police said at the time, and left behind a wife and four children.
Alexis Walker, 30, Walker’s widow, said prosecutors called her early Wednesday morning to tell her about the arrests.
She had expected to wait years longer, she said, and was relieved to be able to deliver the news to his children, who range in age from 10 to 17, the day before the oldest child’s birthday.
“It felt like it’s been forever,” she said. “But we’re really excited that they got caught. It opens up new wounds that we have to start a new journey. But I’m happy they got them off the street because he didn’t deserve to die.”
Police and prosecutors had been investigating the gangs’ feud for more than a year by the time Davell was killed, according to earlier indictments unsealed in January.
Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, said the investigation of Davell’s murder was delayed in part by the coronavirus pandemic, which made it more difficult to impanel grand jurors who could sit for several weeks to hear the prosecutors’ evidence and indict the case.
Davell was one of nine children younger than 3 killed last year, but he was the only victim of gun violence among them. On what would have been his second birthday in September, his father held a memorial decorated with golden paper footballs, a sport he said the boy showed an early love for.
On Thursday, a shrine including stuffed toys and a picture of Davell sat at the base of a tree near the park where he was killed.
Alvin Gordon, who lives across the hall from Davell’s extended family, said he had held Davell earlier on the day he was shot. The block has become calmer since Davell’s death, Gordon said.
“Everybody banded together because everybody loved that little boy,” he said.
Davell’s paternal grandmother, Samantha Gardner, said in an interview last year that she hoped for justice, but that it would not be enough to handle the pain of the boy’s death.
“This is something that’s not going to go away,” she said. “This is something that’s going to be here until we close our eyes. So we have to live on and keep his memory alive, keep justice going on for him. We take it day by day. That’s all we can do.”
Austin was charged in the killing along with his driver, Akeem Artis, 24. A police official who spoke with The Times last year said investigators believed the second gunman was an 18-year-old who has been charged with another murder. The teenager has not been charged in Davell’s case.
Austin and another man, Jayquan Lane, 28, were arrested last year and charged with killing Janile Whitted, a rival who worked as a bouncer at a local strip club, the Amour Cabaret on Nostrand Avenue. Whitted was believed to be a member of the Pop Out Boyz, a Bloods subset whose members were charged with running a credit card and identity theft ring in 2016.
Austin was also arrested and charged with robbery in 2009, gun possession in 2011 and public drinking in 2018. It is unclear how the cases were resolved.
Lane, who was also named in the indictment on Thursday, was previously arrested in connection with a shooting on May 3, 2019, and charged with attempted murder. He had pleaded guilty to criminal forgery charges in 2018 and was serving a sentence of three years of probation.
Artis was arrested in 2019 in Connecticut on larceny and identity theft charges. The charges indicate that he was found with a payment card that did not belong to him and may have been counterfeit. It was not immediately clear how the case was resolved.

Atlanta Officer Who Fatally Shot Rayshard Brooks Is Reinstated

ATLANTA — Garrett Rolfe, the Atlanta police officer who was fired from his job after fatally shooting a Black man, Rayshard Brooks, in a fast-food parking lot, was reinstated on Wednesday by the city’s Civil Service Board, which found that Rolfe’s firing violated his due process rights.
Rolfe was terminated one day after the shooting, which came a few weeks after the police killing of another Black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis. The killing of Brooks led to a new round of demonstrations across the United States, including in Atlanta.
Though reinstated to his job, Rolfe is being placed on administrative leave until the resolution of murder and aggravated assault charges he faces for the June 12 shooting, according to a city news release. Though criminally charged, Rolfe has not yet been indicted, a step needed for the case to move forward. But his lawyer maintains his innocence. “Garrett did not violate the law on June 12, 2020,” the lawyer, Lance LoRusso, said Wednesday.
The decision by the Civil Service Board to reinstate Rolfe turned not on whether the shooting was justified, but on whether the city had followed proper procedures when firing him. At a hearing before the board on April 22, Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, a lawyer for the city, argued that under the city code, “immediate dismissal” of an employee was proper when the employee’s presence on the job “impairs the effectiveness of others.”
“Here we have an officer-involved shooting of a Black man occurring at a time when there are protests against police officer brutality, against Black men in particular,” Lawrence-Hardy said. Keeping Rolfe on the job, she said, “would have been extremely disruptive.”
But in its written order on Wednesday, the board noted that Rolfe was not afforded the opportunity to adequately respond to the city’s notice that it intended to fire him. The decision cited the testimony of Sgt. William Dean of the Atlanta police’s internal affairs division, who said that the firing “seemed rushed.”
Rolfe, the board concluded, was not afforded his right to due process “due to the city’s failure to comply with several provisions” of the city code.
In a statement, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms defended the city’s move to fire Rolfe so quickly, given the level of anger and pain in the streets of Atlanta, a majority African American city.
“Given the volatile state of our city and nation last summer, the decision to terminate this officer, after he fatally shot Mr. Brooks in the back, was the right thing to do,” Bottoms said. “Had immediate action not been taken, I firmly believe that the public safety crisis we experienced during that time would have been significantly worse.”
Bottoms, a first-term mayor, said the day after the shooting that she had called for the “immediate termination” of Rolfe. At the same time, she announced that the police chief, Erika Shields, was stepping down. Rodney Bryant, a department veteran, was named interim chief.
This week, Bottoms announced she was making Bryant the permanent chief. The appointment comes after a period of low morale at the Police Department, which saw a number of officers call in sick after Rolfe was criminally charged.
The department has more than 400 officer vacancies on a force authorized for just over 2,000 sworn positions. Atlanta, like other American cities, has also seen a spike in violent crime that researchers say is connected to the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic.
The killing took place on a Friday night, after Rolfe and his partner, Devin Brosnan, both of whom are white, were called to a Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks, 27, had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-thru lane.
The two officers had a lengthy and cordial discussion with Brooks, body and dashboard camera footage shows. But when he failed a sobriety test and the officers began to arrest him, Brooks fought with them, then wrested away Brosnan’s Taser, firing it at Brosnan. As Brooks ran away, he fired the Taser in the direction of Rolfe. Rolfe then fired his handgun, striking Brooks twice in the back.
Brosnan was charged with three counts for his role in the encounter, including aggravated assault and violations of oath, and was placed on administrative leave. But the criminal case against the officers has been beset by complications and controversy.
The charges were brought by the former Fulton County district attorney, Paul L. Howard Jr. In January, his successor, Fani Willis, wrote to Attorney General Chris Carr of Georgia, alleging that Howard had engaged in misconduct, including using videos of the shooting in campaign commercials in violation of state bar association rules.
As a result, Willis argued, there was “sufficient question of the appropriateness” of the Atlanta-based prosecutor’s office continuing to handle the case.
Willis asked Carr to refer the case to a special prosecutor, but he declined. The matter is currently before a local judge.
On Wednesday, LoRusso said that Rolfe was “very happy” with the decision, “and appreciative that the Civil Service Board had the courage to do the right thing.”
Gerald Griggs, the vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP, said that he hoped the city would appeal the Civil Service Board’s decision and that prosecutors had been right to bring murder charges against Rolfe. “He used a lethal weapon to respond to nonlethal force,” Griggs, a lawyer, said. “There definitely was probable cause for murder charges.”
In the late afternoon, about two dozen demonstrators rallied in front of Atlanta City Hall to protest the decision. “It was a kick in the gut and a slap in the face,” Britt Jones-Chukura, an organizer with a group called Justice for Georgia, said through a megaphone.
Chassidy Evans, Brooks’ niece, said she was upset that Rolfe got his job back. She said she was frustrated with Willis for not moving forward with the criminal case, and with the city for not handling the firing properly.
“At this point it’s like, there’s no court date set, there’s no ending,” she said. “He’s still gone. His children are still without a dad, and it’s hard.”

Debate Erupts at N.J. Law School After White Student Quotes Racial Slur

The controversy over the use of a racial slur that has embroiled a public law school in New Jersey began with a student quoting from case law during a professor’s virtual office hours.
The first-year student at Rutgers Law School in Newark, who is white, repeated a line from a 1993 legal opinion, including the epithet, when discussing a case.
What followed has jolted the state institution, unleashing a polarizing debate over the constitutional right to free speech on campus and the power of a hateful word at a moment of intense national introspection over race, equity and systemic bias.
The tension comes at a time of heightened sensitivity to offensive words on college and law school campuses, where recent uses of slurs by professors during lessons have resulted in discipline and dismissal.
In early April, in response to the incident, a group of Black first-year students at Rutgers Law began circulating a petition calling for the creation of a policy on racial slurs and formal, public apologies from the student and the professor, Vera Bergelson.
“At the height of a ‘racial reckoning,’ a responsible adult should know not to use a racial slur regardless of its use in a 1993 opinion,” states the petition, which has been signed by law school students and campus organizations across the country.
“We vehemently condemn the use of the N-word by the student and the acquiescence of its usage,” the petition says.
Bergelson, 59, has said that she did not hear the word spoken during the videoconference session, which three students attended after a criminal law class, and would have corrected the student if she had.
Soon after the professor’s office hours in late October, a white classmate contacted the student who quoted the epithet to say that she should have avoided using it.
The student, a middle-aged woman studying law as a second career, offered her phone number to continue the discussion and also arranged for a lengthy conversation with the third student, her lawyer said.
One of the students later told a Black classmate; a recording of the meeting, which is no longer accessible, was discovered online and shared.
Black students from the class who were offended by the slur expressed their concerns to another professor, who alerted a dean, David Lopez, soon after the incident, several officials said.
Bergelson said she was never told about her students’ objections, learning of them only after the petition surfaced April 6, five months later. Within days, she said, she convened a meeting with the criminal law class and other first-year students to discuss the incident and to offer an apology. The student, who has not been publicly identified, also apologized during the meeting.
“I wish I could go back in time to that office hour and confront it directly,” Bergelson said in an interview.
Lopez has apologized for failing to address the students’ concerns promptly, a delay that contributed to their frustration and was cited in the petition. But that has done little to quell the tension.
Recent faculty meetings — including one held the day after a police officer was convicted of killing George Floyd — have been marked by heated exchanges, participants said. A racial healing session that was organized by students was filled with raw emotion. The student who uttered the slur is distraught, professors said, and has enlisted the help of a lawyer known for her expertise in free speech and due process.
On Friday, a faculty meeting included a discussion about whether to voluntarily bar racial epithets from being spoken in class, even if citing legal documents verbatim, as Lopez has requested be done.
“I share the views of several of our faculty members who understand and express to their students that this language is hateful and can be triggering, even in the context of a case, and ask that it not be used,” he said in a statement to the school community soon after the petition began circulating.
Among the professors who have signed a statement in support of Bergelson and the student are some of the school’s most prominent faculty members, including John Farmer Jr., a former New Jersey attorney general, and Ronald K. Chen, the state’s onetime public advocate. Both are former deans of Rutgers Law School.
“Although we all deplore the use of racist epithets,” said Gary L. Francione, a law professor who also signed the statement, “the idea that a faculty member or law student cannot quote a published court decision that itself quotes a racial or other otherwise objectionable word as part of the record of the case is problematic and implicates matters of academic freedom and free speech.”
The petition organizers said they were busy with final exams and would have no immediate comment beyond the petition.
Any public use of a racial epithet can carry a risk of steep professional consequences.
The head of the journalism department at Central Michigan University was fired last year after using the same slur when quoting from a lawsuit. An Emory University law school professor was placed on administrative leave for more than a year after using the word in discussions with students about race.
Rutgers officials willing to talk openly about their opposition to the students’ demands have said that the school, as a public institution, has a greater obligation to safeguard students’ and teachers’ First Amendment right to free speech.
“I don’t think the Law School should have rules that are stricter than the Constitution of the United States,” said Dennis M. Patterson, a professor.
Lopez and his co-dean, Kimberly Mutcherson, said in a statement that the discussion underway had nothing to do with “stifling academic freedom, ignoring the First Amendment, or banning words.”
Rather, they said, it was about “how best to create classroom environments in which all of our students feel seen, heard, valued and respected.”
The controversy began on Oct. 28, after a criminal law class all first-year students are required to take. In discussing the circumstances under which a criminal defendant could be held liable for crimes committed by his co-conspirators, the student repeated a quote from a defendant that appeared in an opinion written by a former state Supreme Court judge, Alan B. Handler.
“He said, um — and I’ll use a racial word, but it’s a quote,” the student said, according to a summary of the incident written by professors. “He says, ‘I’m going to go to Trenton and come back with my [expletive]s.”
Samantha Harris, the lawyer representing the woman, said the school would be abdicating its responsibility to train lawyers if it encouraged professors to avoid epithets in all contexts.
“When you’re an attorney, you hear all kinds of horrible things,” said Harris, a former fellow at FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
“You represent people who have said horrible things, who have done horrible things,” she said. “You can’t guarantee a world free of offensive language.”
Adam Scales, a Black professor at Rutgers Law who has signed the statement of support for Bergelson, said he opposed even voluntary limits on speech. But he said the number of his colleagues who believe racial epithets should never be spoken, regardless of the context, is “not insignificant.”
Using euphemisms like “N-word” to avoid the racial slur, he said, obfuscates its repugnant history.
“There is something extremely antiseptic about the term ‘N-word,’” he said. “There is something that softens the impact.”
The faculty discussions, held by videoconference, have been fraught, he said.
“I can’t imagine a less hospitable setting than a 100-person Zoom call to discuss racism,” he said. “It’s a demoralizing time for everyone involved.”
Bergelson, who emigrated from Moscow as an adult, said her belief that slurs rooted in racism, bigotry or misogyny should be avoided in class stems from her personal history. Her grandmother, she said, was a journalist who was executed in 1950 by the Stalin regime for associating with the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. Another relative was executed in 1952.
Bergelson said her mother, who was 16 when her own mother died, never fully recovered from the trauma.
“I certainly grew up in the shadow of this tragedy,” she said. “I am very sensitive to how a word can trigger painful episodes. I would never use the words in class.”
Still, she said, other professors and students should be free to make their own choices.

At some point last summer, there were just too many reports of protesters who had experienced abnormal menstrual cycles after being exposed to tear gas for Britta Torgrimson-Ojerio, a nurse researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon, to dismiss them as coincidence.
A preschool teacher told Oregon Public Broadasting that if she inhaled a significant amount of gas at night, she would get her period the next morning. Other Portland residents shared stories of periods that lasted for weeks and of unusual spotting. Transgender men described sudden periods that defied hormones that had kept menstruation at bay for months or years.
Torgrimson-Ojerio decided she would try to figure out whether these anecdotes were outliers or representative of a more common phenomenon. She surveyed around 2,200 adults who said they had been exposed to tear gas in Portland last summer. In a study published this week in the journal BMC Public Health, she reported that 899 of them — more than 54% of the respondents who potentially menstruate — said they had experienced abnormal menstrual cycles.
“Even though we cannot say anything scientifically definitive about these chemical agents and a causal relationship to menstrual irregularities,” Torgrimson-Ojerio said, “we can definitively say that in our study most people who had menstrual cycles or a uterus reported menstrual irregularities after reporting exposure to tear gas.”
Downstream effects, like the impact on fertility, are not known, but “this is our call to action to ask our scientific community to turn their eye to this issue,” she said.
Torgrimson-Ojerio was also interested in whether people had experienced other problems more than a few hours after being exposed to tear gas. She found that 80% of survey participants had, with difficulty breathing being among the most prevalent complaints.
Kira Taylor, a professor of public health and population health at the University of Louisville School of Public Health and Information Sciences who is conducting a similar study, said that Torgrimson-Ojerio’s study provided “some of the first solid evidence” that tear gas might be linked to menstrual abnormalities. It is also “the first study to document the longer-term effects of tear gas exposure in a large population,” she said.
Sven-Eric Jordt, a professor of anesthesiology, pharmacology and cancer biology at the Duke University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, applauded the work.
Most of the research that police agencies and the government rely on to inform them about tear gas safety “are outdated, often 50 to 70 years old, and don’t measure up to modern toxicological approaches,” he said. “Most of these studies were conducted in young healthy men at the time, either police or military, and not in women, or in a general civilian population representing protesters.”
Torgrimson-Ojerio and her colleagues recruited survey participants through social media and links on the websites of The Oregonian and the Oregon Health Authority in July and August.
The researchers asked participants to explain precisely how their periods had been affected after exposure to tear gas. Increased cramps, unusual spotting and uncharacteristically intense or long bleeding were the most common reactions. A number of people who do not usually have periods because of hormone therapy or age reported unexpected bleeding and spotting, Torgrimson-Ojerio said.
This study has limitations. It is not a random sample.
“It is possible that people who feel that their health was damaged by tear gas might have been more likely to respond than people who were also exposed, yet did not feel such harmful effects,” Taylor said. “This means that some of the numbers might be exaggerated.”
Given that subjects were permitted to participate anonymously, researchers could not verify their accounts.
Nor can the study answer how or why tear gas might be contributing to menstrual irregularities or to what extent other factors are also involved. The authors acknowledge that the high levels of stress and anxiety among protesters, for example, could also have contributed to the physical response.
“It is possible that pain, stress, dehydration and exertion play a role,” Jordt said. Alternatively, tear gas may act as an “endocrine disrupter,” interfering with normal hormonal function.
“The tear gas agent CS, sometimes used by police, is a chlorinated chemical compound and produces additional chlorinated byproducts when burned in the canisters used by the police,” he said. “Exposure to chlorinated chemicals can affect menstrual health.”
Alexander Samuel, a molecular biologist in France, has been investigating similar questions since French protesters began reporting menstrual irregularities.
He mentioned two additional areas for exploration: whether tear gas is metabolized into cyanide, which may cause heavy menstrual bleeding, and the role a traumatic event may play in altering menstrual cycles.
Suspicions about tear gas and menstruation first came up more than a decade ago, during the Arab Spring protests, Jordt noted.
In 2011, Chile also banned the use of tear gas after a study suggested that CS gas could cause miscarriages and harm young children. Three days later, the Chilean police lifted the ban, insisting that the type of tear gas they used was perfectly safe.
