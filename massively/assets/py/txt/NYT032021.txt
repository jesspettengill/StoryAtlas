The last time I was at Kennedy Airport was a year ago, almost to the day. My dance company was performing our “Four Quartets” in Los Angeles — our last show for a live audience before the pandemic shut everything down. Now, it’s Feb. 15, I’m heading for Sydney to work with the Australian Ballet.
My calendar for spring 2020 was a color-coded puzzle. I’d wanted to take advantage of every opportunity that came our way, knowing it wouldn’t be like this forever. I didn’t know it would all be over so suddenly.
Traveling reminds me of my dad, who died in 2018. If he were alive, we would have talked all week about what time I was leaving for the airport. I can hear him now saying “leave earlier … it could take an hour just to get across town” in his Brooklyn accent. He was early to all of my performances. He would show up, opening the theater doors: “Pammy, can you believe I got a parking spot?” Or he’d tell me how he took the express bus from the Bronx all the way down to the East Village. It drove me CRAZY; I was getting ready for the show … but I should have savored it.
At JFK, I talk to David Hallberg, the artistic director of the Australian Ballet and an old friend. He tells me things are normal there. I’ve been in New York since lockdown started last March, experimenting with how to make dance, collaborate with artists and keep the art form alive while not going stir crazy. I’m scared for dance; I’m scared for the arts and I’m scared for New York. The city is wounded.
I’m traveling halfway across the planet to walk into a studio of unmasked dancers to create a dance for a real live audience. It’s incredible — heartbreaking — and I will not let this moment pass unsavored.
When I get to Sydney I’ll have to quarantine for 14 days in a hotel. Real quarantine. Lockdown. No going out for a walk or to pick up a few groceries. Maybe this will help me with the new dance. Limitations and boundaries have always focused me. I like rules, but also like to break them — and quarantine is a rule I can’t break.
Sometimes I set limitations for myself on purpose. I purged walking out of all my dances for five years when I realized I was relying on it too much. I had to re-earn my right to walk in my dances. I also banned entrances and exits for a while. What will I ban after quarantine?
Day 1
I have no structure for my day. To keep focused, I’ll make a schedule, and start following it tomorrow.
I FaceTime with my daughter, Gemma, at college. I miss her. I’m still wearing my Pink Floyd T-shirt and sweats that I put on last night … yesterday … two days ago … in New York.
The reality that I just traveled 24 hours and can’t leave my room hasn’t hit me yet. There is a guy posted in the hallway, making sure no one leaves. The Australian Department of Health is also going to call every day to ask after my health — both COVID-related and mental.
Before I left, I ran around trying to remember everything. I forgot a notebook, which had notes I took while talking to Caroline Shaw about her score for the ballet I’m making, “Watermark.” Darn.
The beginning of making a dance is my favorite part — the research. While in quarantine, I’m going to start drawing the dance, scoring the space first. (It looks something like football plays — bird's-eye views of the stage space.) Separately, I keep track of movement and rhythmic ideas.
The more organized I am, the more I can go “off book” when I actually get in the room with dancers. Then process becomes part of the dance. I love watching dancers warm up and am always on lookout for “mistakes” they make. I like incorporating these into the design of the dance — little glimpses of humanity within the abstractness of the choreography.
I’m making two dances at once — one for Australian Ballet and one for Singapore Dance Theater. The Singapore dance will be made on Zoom and the one for Australian Ballet in person! Both dances will be performed for a live audience!
I’m jet-lagged and thinking in fragments. So much to figure out, including what time of day it is and whether I should be awake or asleep.
Day 2
I’m up at 3:30 a.m. to teach my choreography class at Rutgers on Zoom, 4:30-7:30 a.m. (That’s 12:30-3:30 p.m. in New Jersey.) I’ve showered and put on a shirt and a little makeup, so I don’t scare my students. They’re making dance films and rehearsing on Zoom, so I’m talking to them about using limited resources as an advantage — inspiration from limitation — just like I’m dealing with now.
I give them problem-solving movement exercises, and I try to give them hope. The trajectory of dance in America is forever changed after these months of isolation, cancellation and reconsideration. I believe dance is — and will have to continue — reinventing itself for the post-COVID world. The students will be entering a much-changed creative environment than the one I entered after college. I grapple with how to prepare them when I have no idea what’s coming.
I try to do a few different kinds of exercise a day. Something aerobic, something for arms. I brought my own weights.
Day 3
The novelty is already wearing off and it’s only Day 3. I still haven’t made a schedule, but the time gets filled with the routine calls and door knocks of quarantine.
The nurses call every day to ask if I have any COVID symptoms and if I need to talk to a doctor about anything. Today, the nurse asked me where I had traveled from, and it turned into a 25-minute conversation about how he loves dance, how he used to dance, and his trip to Africa. It was nice to chat. I loved hearing his Australian accent even though I only understood half of what he said.
I had my COVID test. I had to stand against my opened door in profile while they swabbed my throat and nose. Brain tickle.
Food delivery, aka “Knock and Drop”: They deliver meals to me twice a day — no ordering or choosing. (I’ve opted out of breakfast since they bring hazarai, bready junk food.) I don’t know who “they” are; they knock on the door and leave.
It’s nice not to have to order. Choreography is a series of choices I have to make so to get a break from that is OK.
The food has been a mixed bag. Today’s lunch: a “New York beef sourdough sandwich” and a banana.
Day 4
I had the worst dream last night. I was trying to move my body but couldn’t — stuck in one place. My daughter was with me, running ahead of me and I couldn’t catch up.
I’m still jet lagged, I still have no schedule, still get confused by the time difference, still need to choreograph two dances. And I should call my mom.
I brought “Swann’s Way” with me. I’ve tried reading this maybe 10 times. I thought I could try again in quarantine. I want to be a person who can read Proust but I guess I’M JUST NOT. A writer friend suggested that I open the book and read a sentence or two randomly. That is the only way to do it, like a John Cage/Merce Cunningham “chance procedure.”
Today, I made four phrases of “ballet” steps using chance as a starting point for the structure. I want to go deeper with the dancers when I see them. That’s the collaborative part and most satisfying part of making dance — doing it in the moment, relying on my intuition.
I had my first Zoom rehearsal tonight with Singapore Dance Theater. Melissa Toogood, a good friend and the longest collaborator in my company, came from New York to be my assistant. She helps out from her room on Zoom. I’m excited to start, though I’m not sure yet how I’m going pull this off.
Day 5
I woke up later today — 6 a.m.!
And a major change: I moved my computer location from the desk facing the wall to the table facing the windows.
The thing about making two dances at once is if you get stuck on one you can change to the other and still feel productive. I have two new notebooks bought from Amazon Australia. Each dance gets its own notebook for ideas and stage drawings.
I know it’s a little corny, but I like having quotes from artists I admire with me. It’s spiritual company, making me less lonely and giving me something to aspire to. I write this Robert Creeley quote on the first page:
“Content is never more than an extension of form and form is never more than an extension of content.”
As concepts, movement ideas and structures form first. These then inform the dance, so I never have to “decide” what movement goes into which dance if I’m working on two at the same time — the dance tells me.
While on a FaceTime call today with Gemma, she tells me about her writing class. Her assignments deal with a strict form. This is fascinating to me, so I question her more on the specifics and ask her to send me the writing prompt. It sounds so similar to what I do — making similar prompts for myself and creating movement within its structure.
Day 6
It’s 2021, it’s a pandemic, and I’m in Australia. I’m not “well-traveled” but making dances has given me the opportunity. My first time to Europe was for my honeymoon in Paris. I was 28. It was 1998 — we made our hotel reservations by fax. After that, not much else, only little trips.
The first 25 years of my dances were made and performed in New York City. In 1992, my first show was at CBGB’s gallery. We danced barefoot, so I would go around before the show pulling nails out of the floor with a hammer. We were treated like a band and we got a cut of the door.
Now I’m 51, getting hot flashes and still making dances.
Day 7
The halfway mark! And a day off.
Watched Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel series (“The 400 Blows,” “Antoine and Colette,” “Stolen Kisses,” “Bed and Board,” “Love on the Run”).
It’s 5:45. I’m waiting for the knock. I wonder what’s for dinner?!
Day 8
I did not work on any projects yesterday. I feel guilty. My first therapist used to say, “Pam, you wear guilt like a sweater.” Guilt is a cozy place for me, and it’s not productive.
Today I’m more productive. I took a shower.
We had a good rehearsal with Singapore. Translation and articulation of movement is tough and tedious on Zoom, but the dancers are picking up the steps quickly.
I’m still trying to capture a “real life in the studio” feeling. When the dancers created an amazing tableau — all were looking at the camera to hear what I was saying — I had to include it in the dance.
Day 9
It’s a busy day in quarantine: two rehearsals; a costume fitting on Zoom; and an interview about the new ballet. I’ve never been so busy without leaving a room. I’m also going to do two Glo yoga workouts, cardio and a 20-minute arm sculpt. I read that middle-aged women need to lift weights and do strength training, so I try to do this every day.
My rehearsal with Australian Ballet, the first, goes well on Zoom. I started plotting it out with 14 men and three women — 17 altogether — my homage to Balanchine’s “Serenade” (minus the principal roles). My dance will be sandwiched between two Balanchine ballets on the program and I’m trying hard not to think about this.
I explained a little about my work to the dancers, but I could hear the reverb of my nasal American/New York/Jewish accent. I hope it didn’t scare them. Melissa and I got through one phrase during the hour. It’s good prep work for when I see them in person next week.
Day 10
My Pink Floyd T-shirt is still in heavy rotation.
Melissa is leaving quarantine. I will miss her! Even though I never actually saw her, knowing she was here helped. Reid Bartelme (costume designer) is here now, so I call him on the landline. He says, “Pam, we have cellphones,” but I like the landline.
I just signed into Zoom for my noon rehearsal but no one is there. Ah, noon Singapore time, 3 p.m. for me … oy! Working in three different time zones, I’m surprised this hasn’t happened before now.
Day 11
Feeling unfocused today.
Another beef pie for lunch … bummer.
I try to say hi to the guard in the hall. That’s me, trying to connect. One thing my dances are “about” is disconnection — missed connections and making that disconnection work.
After being isolated like this, I’m curious about how being confined to this space will (or will not) affect my work.
Day 12
See ANY day, 1 through 11. It’s all the same.
Day 13, last day of being in one room
“The house shelters daydreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.” (Gaston Bachelard)
I can hide here in quarantine.
Day 14
At 9 a.m., I open my door to two police, two border force guys and a hotel guard. I say, “Wow, I need five guards to check out?” And they laugh and say, “We heard you were trouble.”I’ve realized in this room that when I meet the Australian Ballet dancers I will have no rules. I will make a dance. Freedom.

Three witnesses testified Tuesday morning, the second day of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with murder in George Floyd’s death. They included Darnella Frazier, the teenager who took the widely shared video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck.
Frazier was 17 when she recorded the cellphone video and uploaded it to Facebook in May, igniting international protests over racism and police abuse. Frazier, now 18, said in court that she feels regret for not physically engaging the officers, but that they were the ones ultimately at fault.
“It’s been nights I stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life,” Frazier said. She added, seemingly referring to Chauvin, who sat with his lawyer nearby: “But it’s like, it’s not what I should have done, it’s what he should have done.”
Frazier has largely stayed out of the spotlight since Floyd’s death, but she said his death has haunted her and that she has anxiety.
“When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad, I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they’re all Black,” Frazier said. “I have a Black father. I have a Black brother. I have Black friends.
She added: “I look at how that could have been one of them.”
On the day of Floyd’s death, Frazier said, she had been walking to the Cup Foods convenience store with her 9-year-old cousin to get some snacks when they came upon the arrest.
“I see a man on the ground, and I see a cop kneeling down on him,” Frazier said. She described seeing Floyd “terrified, scared, begging for his life.”
Frazier said that as a crowd of bystanders yelled more loudly at the officers, Chauvin reached for his mace.
“I felt in danger when he did that,” she said.
Frazier’s voice was emotional on the stand and she cried several times during her testimony. Judge Peter A. Cahill ruled Tuesday that Frazier and three other witnesses, two of whom are minors and one of whom is also 18, could testify off-camera.
Frazier made one of her first public comments earlier this month, as the jury was being selected, when she wrote on Facebook and Instagram that Chauvin “deserves to go down” and wondered aloud “what else got covered up if it was no evidence.”
Frazier has been praised by Chief Medaria Arradondo of the Minneapolis Police Department and, in December, received an award for courage from PEN America, a group that promotes free expression. Spike Lee, the film director, presented her with the award during a virtual event.
Frazier’s 9-year-old cousin, who was walking with her to the Cup Foods convenience store when they came upon the arrest, also briefly testified: “I was sad and kind of mad,” she said of seeing a police officer with his knee on a man’s neck. “It felt like he was stopping his breathing and it was kind of like hurting him.”
Chauvin's defense attorney spent a good deal of the morning trying to discredit Donald Williams II, a mixed martial artist who witnessed Floyd's death, by drawing attention to his lack of knowledge of medical aid and police training.
Eric J. Nelson asked Williams to outline his experience as a fighter, his knowledge of different moves and even asking him whether he ever was able to speak when he was held in chokehold during a fight.
Williams reacted by turning to the judge on that last question, puzzled. The line of questioning suggested, as some observers have said, that Floyd would not have been able to speak had Chauvin cut off his airway by kneeling on his neck.
What began as a routine back-and-forth questioning that focused on Williams detailing his fighting experience became more pointed when Nelson began to ask him if he had threatened police as he watched Floyd be detained. Nelson attempted to paint Williams as an angry, disruptive bystander who had no medical experience with which to accurately judge the police officers’ actions. Nelson argued in his opening statement that the bystanders made the police’s job harder.
The back and forth was tense at times, with Nelson asking Williams if witnessing the situation made him want to fight the police officers.
“You can’t paint me out to be angry,” Williams said multiple times. Williams said he could see Floyd “was going through tremendous pain.’’
Clad in a light-blue surgical mask and a suit and tie, Chauvin betrayed little emotion as witnesses described him as cold and heartless. He scribbled notes diligently on a legal pad, stole glances at the jury and stood when identified by witnesses.
Attempts by the defense to humanize Chauvin are central to their effort to portray him as a responsible person who was only doing his job, said Justin Hansford, a law professor at Howard University’s law school. That’s part of a strategy to mitigate the “heinous” video that shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd, he said.
A defense lawyer will advise clients to look empathetic and engaged “even when there are emotional pieces of testimony,” Hansford said. “The jurors will certainly glance over at him, to look at his engagement.” He added that defendants are often advised not to have any skeptical or hostile reactions. “The position is that you are sorry about what happened to the gentleman but you were doing your job.’'
Mary Fay, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal law and criminal proceedings at the University of Washington School of Law, said that the defense strategy appeared to rely on “split-second syndrome.”
“The Supreme Court has recognized that law enforcement officers have to make decisions in the heat of the moment,” she said. “They’ve given police officers a lot of latitude in these judgment calls, including with respect to the use of force.”
Chauvin’s demeanor — seen in his note taking and professional attire — played into this strategy by making him seem “respectful of procedure” and provided an alternative image for the jury to counter the one of the officer seen in the video. It emphasized that “this is a trained professional with almost two decades of experience who was in a volatile situation,” Fay said.

MINNEAPOLIS — A white intensive care nurse who said if she saw someone on the street who needed help, she would feel obligated to step in. A Black grandmother who said she had no personal experience with the police or the criminal justice system.
A white widow who rides a motorcycle in her spare time and said she believes that “all lives matter.” A Black man who works in banking and said he was eager to serve on the jury of “the most historic case of my lifetime.”
These are some of the jurors appointed to weigh the evidence in the case of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer who is accused of murdering George Floyd, a Black man.
The jury is a demographic mix: three Black men, one Black woman and two women who identified themselves as multiracial. There are two white men and four white women. They are urban and suburban, ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s. The two alternates are white women.
The jurors bring to the table a range of views about Chauvin, Floyd, race and policing, some forged by long life experience and some formed after the video of Floyd dying under Chauvin’s knee launched a new civil rights movement.
And yet they remain invisible, unseen by all but the very few people allowed into the courtroom. Because of the many threats against people involved in the case and the potential for outside pressure, the 12 jury members and two alternates remain anonymous and their faces cannot be shown on camera.
During opening arguments Monday, many of the jurors took notes, according to representatives of the news media who were allowed in the courtroom. During one replay of the video, a juror held her forehead, rubbing her face and eyes. All of the jury members are wearing face coverings because of coronavirus protocols, so parsing their reactions is even more difficult.
Most of what is known about the jurors comes from the jury selection process, more than two weeks of questioning that touched on virtually every contentious issue in American life, including COVID restrictions, Black Lives Matter, defunding the police, conspiracy theories and opioid addiction. The rest was provided by the court: a list of their approximate ages and races.
More than 300 potential jurors filled out a 14-page questionnaire that asked about their views on policing, protests, race and criminal justice, among other questions, and their answers showed the hurdles the defense must overcome in a case about which so much is widely known. Lawyers for the defense and the prosecution then questioned potential jurors one on one.
At least 10 of the 15 jurors and alternates chosen indicated that they had already formed a “somewhat negative” opinion of Chauvin. (The third alternate was dismissed Monday.) But their views were nuanced — several said they had positive views of the police but also believed that the criminal justice system is biased against Black people.
Juror No. 92, a white woman in her 40s, wrote on a questionnaire that she had a “very favorable” opinion of Blue Lives Matter.
“I would be terrified if our police departments were dismantled,” she wrote, according to what the defense lawyer read aloud during jury selection. “However, it is obvious that change needs to happen.”
Many of the jurors expressed dismay over what had happened to Floyd or questioned the actions of the four officers involved, three of whom will face charges in a separate trial. Juror No. 27, a Black man in his 30s, wrote that Floyd “could have been me or anyone else,” according to the answers that the defense read back to him during questioning. No. 52, also a Black man in his 30s, wrote, “My opinion has been, why didn’t the other officers stop Chauvin?”
Juror No. 89, the nurse, said that since Floyd had died she would have to conclude that police had knelt on him for “too long.” No. 44, a white executive at a health care nonprofit, said, “I do not know the laws and procedures of the police for detainment, but a man died and I’m sure that’s not procedure.”
The jurors said they could set their opinions and knowledge aside and consider only the evidence presented.
Throughout the questioning, both the defense and the prosecution probed jurors on their views about protests, riots, Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter. They also undoubtedly considered the juror’s race, which has long been considered a clue to how someone might view a case.
Typically, the defense in a case like this would be more likely to strike jurors of color because they are considered more skeptical of law enforcement. But in this case, many white prospective jurors were critical of the police.
“I think what the defense has found is that, you know, race isn’t as useful a proxy — especially whiteness in this case isn’t as useful a proxy as it is in some other cases in which police officers are accused,” said Paul Butler, a former prosecutor and professor at Georgetown Law.
Some jurors spoke revealingly about how they had grappled with the turmoil of the past year.
Juror No. 44, the health care executive, recounted a conversation she had with a Black colleague about white privilege.
“I admit it, I didn’t get it,” she said. “Like, why do we have to call racism a new term?”
The colleague explained that she had to teach her son to keep his hands on the wheel and not move if the police stopped him, for his own safety.
“That was not something I ever thought about teaching my son,” the juror said.
The defense lawyer, Eric Nelson, used many of his questions to suggest to jurors that they did not know the whole story — previewing his opening statement Monday, when he tried to steer the jury away from what they know from the video and focus on other evidence, such as police training policies and medical records of Floyd.
After one prospective juror who wrote that from what she had seen, the police “appeared to take little action despite the pleas of George and bystanders,” Nelson asked if the woman had investigated what happened before or after the video. She acknowledged that she had not.
The racial makeup of the jury is more diverse than many expected — in fact, the jury has a higher percentage of Black people than the city of Minneapolis, which is about 20% Black.
But strong views about racism and police brutality based on personal experience may have been enough to get passed over.
A Black potential juror, No. 76, said he has always wondered why police officers are rarely held accountable for the deaths of Black people, and sitting on the jury would put him “in the room to know why.”
He said that after someone was arrested or shot, officers would drive through his former neighborhood playing the song, “Another One Bites the Dust.”
Many of the jurors said they had mixed feelings, including anxiety and trepidation, when they received their jury summonses and realized which case it was for. But then, they recognized that history had called.
“Everyone’s lives are changed by this incident and what happened,” Juror No. 44 said. “Everyone’s lives. And it’s not easy. For anyone.”

MINNEAPOLIS — Before prosecutors called their first witness, lawyers for both sides made opening statements to jurors in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in George Floyd’s death.
Jerry W. Blackwell, one of the prosecutors, played the lengthy bystander video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck, noting repeatedly that Chauvin did not “let up” or “get up” for about nine minutes and 30 seconds. He began to indicate to jurors that, in the prosecutors’ view, Chauvin used more force than was reasonable, given that Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground. Blackwell said to jurors, “You can believe your eyes, that it’s homicide — it’s murder.”
On the other hand, Chauvin’s lawyer Eric J. Nelson noted that there were more than 50,000 pieces of evidence in the case and said there was much more to what happened than the length of time that Chauvin had knelt on Floyd’s neck. Nelson argued that Floyd’s death was caused by his underlying heart disease, use of fentanyl and “the adrenaline flowing through his body.”
He also began to lay the groundwork for an argument that Chauvin’s force had been within the bounds of his training and that Floyd had resisted, saying that “this was not an easy struggle.”
The first witness to take the stand was Jena Scurry, a 911 dispatcher in Minneapolis who alerted a police supervisor in May after she watched officers pin George Floyd to the ground live on a surveillance camera.
Seemingly concerned by the officers’ actions, she had called the supervisor to say that officers “sat on this man” and asked whether they had notified the supervisor that they had used force.
“You can call me a snitch if you want to,” she said before relaying what she saw on the cameras by Cup Foods, the convenience store outside of which Floyd was arrested.
Prosecutors called Scurry to the stand, and they will most likely use her testimony to make a case that even Scurry, who works with law enforcement, was worried about how officers were treating Floyd. In his opening statement, Blackwell said Scurry had done something “she had never done in her career: She called the police on the police.”
The trial begins 10 months after Floyd, a Black man, died in May after being held down by police officers on a South Minneapolis street corner in an episode that was captured on a cellphone video and set off protests for racial justice around the nation. Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes, ignoring Floyd’s repeated pleas that he could not breathe and his cries for his mother.
For a country that rarely holds police officers accountable for killing people on the job, especially Black people, the trial is a test of whether the criminal justice system has changed after Floyd’s death. The case is the most pivotal police brutality trial since the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles in the early 1990s.
Against the backdrop of the ongoing struggle to reform policing and push the nation forward on matters of racial justice, the trial will be fought on the narrower grounds of toxicology reports, medical records and police training manuals. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Above all, the case is likely to turn on one central question: What caused Floyd’s death?
The centerpiece of Chauvin’s defense strategy, as laid out in motions and pretrial arguments, is making the case that Floyd died of a drug overdose — a toxicology report showed fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system — complicated by underlying health conditions.
The prosecution will try to convince the jury that Chauvin’s knee on Floyd’s neck for so long was a substantial factor in his death, regardless of the amount of drugs in his system and his health problems.

NEW YORK — A year after nationwide protests against police brutality ignited calls for reform, the New York City Council passed legislation on Thursday aimed at reining in police misconduct by making it far easier to sue officers for conducting illegal searches or using excessive force.
For decades, the police across the country have been able to invoke an esoteric legal doctrine known as qualified immunity to protect themselves from lawsuits claiming they had violated the constitutional rights of people they arrested.
In the aftermath of the protests against the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis, ending the use of that defense on the local and federal levels has become a top demand of police reform activists.
With the council’s vote, New York City becomes the largest jurisdiction to limit the ability of officers to invoke the defense, joining the states of Colorado and Connecticut. Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Thursday that he supported the legislation, suggesting he would not veto it.
“What we are doing is saying the police can’t walk into the courtroom and say, ‘The plaintiff has no right to bring me here because I am immune,’” said Councilman Stephen Levin, D-Brooklyn, who sponsored the bill. “This is about giving people a right to protect the most fundamental rights in our democracy.”
The bill was one of several police-reform measures passed by the City Council on Thursday. City lawmakers also gave final approval to de Blasio’s $72 million plan for improving police practices and accountability, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has asked all jurisdictions in the state to finish before April 1.
The combined package addresses a range of issues. One bill gives the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which looks into misconduct, the power and staff to investigate racial bias in policing. Another requires the police to collect data on car stops, including the race of the people arrested.
But the centerpiece of the package was the bill intended to make it harder for officers to deploy a qualified immunity defense to shield themselves from lawsuits. It passed by a vote of 37-11.
In essence, the bill establishes a local right — the protection against unreasonable searches and the use of excessive force — and says officers cannot use the qualified immunity defense against it. As a practical matter, it allows people to sue the police for damages under local law, rather than federal or state statutes.
The doctrine dates back to the 1960s, when the courts ruled that officers who arrested clergy members for using segregated facilities in a Mississippi bus terminal could not be held liable if they acted in good faith and with probable cause under a statute they believed to be valid.
But over the years the rule has been expanded by the courts, and it now requires plaintiffs to prove that officers violated a constitutional right that had been “clearly established” in a previous case. That is a high legal hurdle that critics say is often impossible to overcome and allows officers to escape accountability for their actions.
Researchers from the City Council found at least 180 lawsuits over the last three years in which qualified immunity or its equivalent was invoked on behalf of the Police Department. A judge approved its use in about 100 cases.
Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, said before the vote that qualified immunity is “rooted in our system of systemic racism” and has been used to “deny justice to victims of police abuse for decades.”
Recent rulings by the Supreme Court have stirred speculation that the nation’s highest court might roll back the doctrine, which emerged as a flashpoint during nationwide protests over Floyd’s death.
The doctrine has attracted opposition from across the ideological spectrum. The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Washington, called for abolishing the qualified immunity defense last year in a scathing policy paper, and the National Basketball Players Association voiced support for the City Council’s bill.
Robert Quackenbush, staff attorney with the Prisoners’ Rights Project at The Legal Aid Society, said in a statement that qualified immunity had allowed a “culture of impunity” to “exist and fester” within the Police Department. He also called for state lawmakers to pass similar legislation.
Opponents of the bill, however, argued that the rule was a necessary protection that allowed police officers to do their jobs effectively. Ending qualified immunity is reckless and may discourage people from going into law enforcement, they said.
“Ending qualified immunity will prevent the best young men and women in our city from joining the police force,” Councilman Robert F. Holden said as he voted no.
The Police Benevolent Association also opposed the bill, and has said it would “chill the operations of law enforcement” and remove “long-standing safeguards protecting police officers” who are acting in good faith.
“New Yorkers are getting shot, and police officers are on the streets day and night, trying to stop the bloodshed,” the union’s president, Patrick J. Lynch, said in a statement.
De Blasio said he had concerns about earlier versions of the legislation but now felt that the City Council version was “aligned” with national legislation, known as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which also limits qualified immunity as a defense.
“I think it’s a very strong reform package,” the mayor said.
Some experts on policing questioned, however, whether the measure would be effective at curbing police misbehavior. Taxpayers already pay millions of dollars annually to settle police misconduct lawsuits, but allegations of abuse have not slowed. The city paid out about $220 million to settle lawsuits against the police in 2019, the comptroller’s office said.
“People want to see a system where it’s not easy to violate people’s civil rights, such as removing police from certain situations,” said Susan Kang, a political scientist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
Councilwoman Adrienne E. Adams, D-Queens, chairwoman of the Public Safety committee, said the bills passed on Thursday were only the “beginning and not the end of police reform in New York City.”
Even as the council moved to curb the use of qualified immunity, the city Law Department indicated recently that it would use the defense in lawsuits being brought by state Attorney General Letitia James and others accusing the Police Department of using excessive force against protesters during the Floyd protests last summer.
James’ office has charged in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that the Police Department “unjustifiably deployed pepper spray and used batons, bikes, and other force against protesters, repeatedly violating New Yorkers’ constitutional rights.”
City lawyers said in a Feb. 15 letter to Judge Colleen McMahon that the qualified immunity defense would apply because the protests happened during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Given the unique circumstances that policing mass protests in a pandemic present, it cannot be said that the law is clearly established,” the lawyers wrote.

NEW YORK —The race to become Manhattan’s next district attorney is shaping up to be one of the most important in decades, a watershed contest that is likely to fundamentally change the mission of the prominent office and may affect the future of former President Donald Trump.
Yet the eight candidates are all relative unknowns, and with no public polling, there is no clear front-runner. The victor is likely to win the general election in November without having received a majority of votes in the Democratic primary.
Most of the candidates believe prosecutors should be sending fewer people to prison, especially for minor crimes, and that the office should play an active role in creating a less punitive, less racially biased criminal justice system.
The election is being watched as a test of what a borough considered to be a liberal bastion wants from its head prosecutor, and just how deeply voters want the criminal justice system to change.
“The Manhattan DA’s office is justifiably seen as one of the premier offices in the country,” said Eric H. Holder Jr., the U.S. attorney general under former President Barack Obama. “What happens in the DA’s office will have an outsized influence on the path of reform around the country.”
The current officeholder, Cyrus Vance Jr., announced earlier this month that he would not seek reelection.
Vance, who has no plans to endorse a candidate, has held the position for three terms and was the hand-picked successor of Robert M. Morgenthau, who over four decades built the office’s reputation as one of the largest and most ambitious prosecutorial agencies in the country.
Vance’s announcement catapulted the race into the national spotlight, as his successor stands to inherit an investigation into whether Trump and his company committed fraud to obtain loans and tax benefits.
The race can be divided into two camps, with three candidates who have not worked as prosecutors and five who have.
The candidates who have never prosecuted a case — Tahanie Aboushi, Eliza Orlins and Dan Quart — have argued that the core work of the district attorney’s office needs to be revamped, shifting toward reducing incarceration and cutting back prosecution of low-level crimes.
Four of the former prosecutors — Alvin Bragg, Lucy Lang, Tali Farhadian Weinstein and Diana Florence — largely agree. But they have pitched themselves as occupying a middle ground, focused on less sweeping changes. A fifth former prosecutor, Liz Crotty, has been less vocal in calling for systemic change.
Ranked-choice voting — which allows voters to express whom they would support if their top choice does not win — will not be used in the primary June 22.
That means whoever gets the biggest slice of votes in the Democratic primary, even if far from a majority, will go on to the general election. There, victory is almost certain because so far there are no Republicans on the ballot.
The ‘Progressive Prosecutor’ Movement
In the decade since Vance took office in 2010, views of criminal justice have shifted in many urban centers, transforming elections for local prosecutors.
Activists — most prominently those in the Black Lives Matter movement — have used social media platforms to raise awareness of police violence, mass incarceration and racial bias in the justice system.
“We as a general society are seeing on a larger scale how things like police violence are impacting people’s lives,” said Nicole Smith Futrell, a law professor at the City University of New York.
Starting with the election of Kenneth P. Thompson as the Brooklyn district attorney in 2013, voters have rewarded candidates across the country who have focused on prosecutorial and police misconduct.
These politicians — often grouped together as “progressive prosecutors” — have included Larry Krasner in Philadelphia, Kim Foxx in Chicago and George Gascón in Los Angeles.
In New York City, Eric Gonzalez, who was elected as Brooklyn district attorney in 2017, said he wanted to lead “the most progressive DA’s office in the country.” A former public defender, Tiffany Cabán, who pledged to stop prosecuting low-level crimes, lost the race for Queens district attorney by the slimmest of margins in 2019.
The Candidates
Most of the candidates competing to succeed Vance said that they will redirect the power wielded by the Manhattan district attorney. Others have pledged to fundamentally reduce it.
Aboushi, 35, has pointed toward her adolescent experience of seeing her father convicted on federal conspiracy charges related to the theft of trucks transporting cigarettes. He was sent to prison for 22 years. Aboushi has said she wants to keep the district attorney’s office from harming families like her own.
Along with Orlins, she has committed to cutting the office in half. She has also stressed the use of alternatives to prison. She has won support from the left and has been endorsed by the Working Families Party, a power player in New York.
Aboushi, who has worked at her family’s law firm since 2010, would be the first woman, Muslim and nonwhite candidate to hold the office. (Every contender except for Quart would break at least one such barrier.)
Orlins and Quart are running campaigns in a similar vein. Orlins, 38, a longtime public defender, has a fiery social media presence and often mentions the damage that she said prosecutors did to her clients. She has pledged not to prosecute the majority of misdemeanors.
“ I saw clients getting cycled through the system, getting locked up, getting bail set, getting offered ridiculous plea deals, spending a month or two months in jail for these low-level minor offenses,” she said.
Quart, 47, a seven-term assemblyman and the only candidate with any previous political experience, has argued that he is the only person running who has already changed the system. He points to his role in successful efforts to repeal laws that protected police from accountability and put thousands of people in jail for low-level crimes.
“My experience is about not just the rhetoric of reform, but actually achieving it,” Quart said.
All three have argued that it is a virtue never to have prosecuted anyone, suggesting that the very act of prosecution should bear some stigma. By contrast, the ex-prosecutors in the race sprinkle suggestions for change with specifics on how to curtail certain crimes.
Alvin Bragg, 47, the only Black candidate, seems comfortable running both as a reformer and a career law enforcement official. Bragg, who was a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and later chief deputy attorney general in New York, was the only candidate to appear at both a “decarceral debate” held by public defenders and a forum organized by alumni of the Manhattan district attorney’s office — audiences with opposing viewpoints.
Bragg has leaned on his roots in Harlem. He often brings up the half-dozen times he has had a gun pointed at him, including three encounters involving police officers. He has said he wants to reduce unnecessary incarceration and fight crime.
“One thing we need to reject is this false dichotomy that you’ve got between civil rights and public safety,” he said.
Bragg’s closest competitor in straddling the two camps is Lucy Lang, who worked at the Manhattan district attorney’s office for 12 years. Lang, 40, is steeped in policy and has released the outlines of her approach to dozens of issues, from sex crimes to restorative justice. She presents herself as someone who would change the office but also has the experience to manage high-profile cases.
Tali Farhadian Weinstein, 45, a former federal prosecutor and general counsel in the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, is running a more conservative campaign than her colleagues and has a substantial lead in fundraising. She has been endorsed by Holder, with whom she worked at the Department of Justice.
Although she emphasizes her experience in Brooklyn, where she led a unit that reviews convictions, Farhadian Weinstein has also been direct in describing her approach to prosecution. “You can’t just identify the problem,” she said. “You also then have to have a positive agenda about what the solution is.”
The final two candidates stand apart from the field for different reasons.
Florence, 50, is also a veteran of the Manhattan district attorney’s office and spent much of her career prosecuting fraud and corruption cases. She wants the office to refocus its energy on cases against the powerful.
But she must overcome a significant hurdle: She resigned from the office after a judge found that she had withheld evidence from defense lawyers in a major bribery case, a serious ethical violation. A spokesperson for Florence’s campaign said she has taken “full responsibility” for the mistake.
Crotty, 50, a former assistant district attorney under Morgenthau, has conformed least to the blueprint set by the other contenders. Although she acknowledges systemic racism, she is loath to call for systemic solutions, saying instead that she will evaluate matters on a case-by-case basis. She has pledged to strengthen the office’s investigations of white-collar crime.
The Trump Investigation
Vance is likely to decide whether to seek an indictment against Trump before he leaves office. If he does, the next district attorney will have to handle the prosecution of a former president.
The candidates have been reluctant to discuss the case in detail, saying it would be unethical to offer an opinion without seeing the evidence firsthand.
It is unclear how the prospect of a trial of a former president might influence voters. Some strategists say it would matter little. Others say it favors experienced prosecutors.
“This is Manhattan,” said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, Vance’s former deputy. “You’re going to have high-profile, high-interest, serious crimes. You need people who know how to handle those cases.”

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — They were invited. So they came.
After a year of mostly staying inside, a mix of college students on spring break and tourists, by the tens of thousands, descended on Miami Beach, a vacation hot spot that — along with the rest of Florida — has lifted most COVID-19 restrictions, opening its restaurants, clubs and bars.
The huge crowds that gathered in the city’s famous 10-block beachside entertainment district starting in late February became unruly at times, with fights breaking out and gunshots fired into the air, causing stampedes.
In the weeks since, more than 1,000 people have been arrested, one-third or more on drug and alcohol consumption charges. Police have seized more than 100 guns. And there has been some violence; in perhaps the most serious case, two male visitors are accused of drugging and raping a woman who later died.
But the raucous partying was also, by and large, nonviolent, city officials say. And for that reason, many Black leaders in town have questioned what happened next.
On Saturday, the city declared a state of emergency. A few hours later, a military-style armored vehicle and police officers in riot gear moved down Ocean Drive, blaring sound cannons and firing pepper balls to disperse the crowds and enforce the newly declared curfew.
The resulting footage of heavily armed police officers cracking down on unarmed crowds reminded many people of last summer’s protests against police brutality, prompting local Black leaders to criticize Miami Beach city officials for being poorly prepared for the chaos and unnecessarily heavy-handed in their response. The city has been accused of racism before in its handling of large Black crowds, particularly during Memorial Day weekends over the years.
“This felt like a total overreaction,” said Stephen Hunter Johnson, chair of the Miami-Dade Black Affairs Advisory Board. “Of course their job is to make sure people are safe and to deal with unruly behavior, but why do they handle Black tourists so aggressively? I think people see these large crowds of young Black people, and there is anger and the sense that something must be done. We want our people to be treated the same as anyone else, not better or worse.”
Johnson also said that similar partying by white tourists in another spring break locale, South Padre Island in Texas, had not brought a similar police crackdown.
The mayhem — largely maskless revelers blowing off steam after months of lockdown, followed by sudden restrictions and police enforcement — also provides a cautionary tale for other tourist havens that are moving swiftly to reopen. That the partyers were mostly Black brought added scrutiny of race and policing in the post-George Floyd era.
“Right now, Miami Beach is at the intersection of COVID, race, policing and its own history,” said Marvin Dunn, a longtime Miami historian and retired university professor. “I would imagine other cities opening are looking at what happened here.”
Dan Gelber, the mayor of Miami Beach, said he understood the fraught optics of overpolicing of African Americans, especially in the wake of the police killing of Floyd last year and the nationwide racial reckoning that followed.
But he said that the police response was a reasonable strategy for clearing the streets and that he trusted the decisions of police leaders who were dealing with swelling crowds — and at least a few serious troublemakers. The strenuous police response, he asserted, was not caused by typical spring break antics.
“We did not target race; we targeted conduct,” he said in an interview. “What we have experienced the last month has been frightening. We’ve had gunplay, where people shoot up in the air and hundreds or thousands of people start storming in fear. The overwhelming number of people who are coming here are here to enjoy our city, but we are also getting a smaller crowd that’s interested in chaos.”
This is the second spring break season shaped largely by the pandemic. Last year, cities had to close beaches in mid-March as COVID cases soared and public health experts warned that the close gatherings were primed to become superspreader events.
This year, hundreds of universities canceled spring break to discourage students from traveling and congregating while the virus is still a threat. Waves of college students and other somewhat older vacationers flocked to Florida anyway, lured by cheap flights and hotels and the promise of loose COVID-19 regulations — creating some of the largest crowds in recent memory.
“This is not a typical spring break; you have people suffering from pandemic fatigue who really want to come and let off some steam with an anything-goes attitude,” said Raul Aguila, Miami Beach’s interim city manager, adding that some of the behavior had descended into lawlessness. “It’s the perfect storm of events that has led to this becoming a public safety issue.”
Phillip Carter, 30, flew from Baltimore to spend a few days on the beach but was quickly turned off by the large crowds.
“I know to not come on spring break,” he said. “It’s just a lot. It’s cool, but it’s just too many people. As many times as I’ve come to Miami, I’ve never seen it like this. It’s like a war zone. That’s what it feels like: a war zone.”
Before Miami Beach shut down its spring break festivities last year, it counted 332 arrests between Feb. 3 and March 7. During the same time period this year, the number has more than doubled to 731 arrests. As of March 21, there have been 1,050 arrests — many involving people older than 25 — on charges including public consumption of drugs or alcohol, reckless driving and resisting arrest.
In the case of the woman who died, police have arrested two North Carolina men on charges of drugging and raping her and stealing her credit cards. The woman, a 24-year-old from Pennsylvania, was later found dead in her Miami Beach hotel room.
Faced with what the mayor called an “overwhelming” number of visitors packed into the tiny beachfront strip, Miami Beach set a curfew Saturday afternoon that took effect at 8 p.m., along with a nightly shutdown of access to the island on which Miami Beach sits (both restrictions were extended into April).
Richard Clements, police chief in Miami Beach, defended the way the city had used officers in riot gear to clear the streets, saying the pepper balls had been used only when the crowd surged toward officers.
“The BearCat Vehicle was there as a support vehicle that would only be utilized in a rescue (downed officer or injured person) situation where extraction efforts from the location was impeded by the crowd,” he said in an emailed statement, referring to the armored vehicle.
He added that the response would be reviewed internally.
Daniella Pierre, president of the Miami-Dade NAACP, said the city needed to find alternative strategies for spring break crowds, such as providing cultural programming to keep visitors occupied and projecting a more welcoming attitude toward Black visitors, many of whom have complained in the past about excessive policing and hostility from some businesses.
“Inadequate planning,” she said. “The minute it became clear that Florida was going to be open, there should have been planning to accommodate the crowds. Of course the police were outnumbered because there was no plan. I am not condoning the violence or lawlessness; I am saying it felt like you looked at the group and treated them like they were here to do you harm.”
After driving two hours from his home in Montgomery, Alabama, to Atlanta to catch a flight to Miami with friends, TJ Ray, 32, learned their vacation trip to South Beach was suddenly in jeopardy.
News had reached them that city officials were cracking down — and hard — on large groups of tourists. They had shelled out hundreds on flights and an Airbnb, and now city officials were on national newscasts announcing they would be imposing a mandatory curfew.
The response from the city in implementing the curfew came off not only as heavy-handed, Ray said as he was hanging with friends on Ocean Drive, but too little, too late.
“They know how spring break is going to go,” he said. “We’ve been locked down with the pandemic, even though the pandemic’s still going on. They know people want to get out.”

NEW YORK — After a year when the pandemic and protests over police brutality underscored New York City’s broad racial inequities, Mayor Bill de Blasio has unveiled a sweeping initiative to examine and remake the City Charter to correct imbalances.
The mayor on Tuesday announced the formation of a Racial Justice Commission that will be empowered to make policy recommendations that he said would be designed to “dismantle structural racism for all New Yorkers.”
The 11-member commission could propose bold policies like a jobs guarantee for all residents, or reparation payments to Black residents. The commission is expected to make its recommendations this year, the last of de Blasio’s eight years in office. Some of the proposals could go before New Yorkers next year as ballot measures.
The idea is modeled after reconciliation commissions in countries like South Africa, Canada and Argentina that have addressed legacies of racism and violence.
The group will seek to make changes through the City Charter, a document that serves as the city’s constitution. De Blasio, a Democrat, said it was the first commission of its kind in the United States.
“We’ve never had a model for actually addressing structural racism, institutional racism,” de Blasio said at a news conference. “Identifying it, acknowledging it, formally apologizing for it, weeding it out, eradicating it, making the policy changes, changing the laws.”
The group’s mission statement says it will “seize the transformative potential of this moment in history” to recommend “structural changes and significant policy reforms that will advance racial justice and equity.”
Broadly speaking, the commission intends to take “steps toward reparation of harms” that could include a public apology from the city, according to the mayor’s office.
The mayor did not name specific ways that might happen, but members of the commission have supported ideas like baby bonds, a government-funded savings account for every child.
There may be proposals related to police reform and voting changes. The commission could also look broadly at areas of the city that have been affected by racism, such as the inequitable distribution of city parks.
De Blasio said the commission would identify racism across city agencies and named two examples: diversifying the fire department and making sure the landmarks commission preserved the history of all New Yorkers.
The commission’s chair, Jennifer Jones Austin, the executive director of a major anti-poverty group, said in an interview that the commission would consider reparations.
“We should have conversations about reparations and what that could look like,” she said.
De Blasio agreed that “everything should be on the table.”
The vice chair is Henry Garrido, executive director of District Council 37, a union that represents thousands of city workers.
One prominent member is Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy at The New School who has pushed for establishing baby bonds, canceling student debt, and guaranteeing a job for all residents who want one.
Each baby would receive a grant that they could use in the future for college or a down payment to buy a home.
“Without capital, inequality is locked in,” Hamilton said in a TED Talk that has been viewed more than 1.5 million times.
Other members of the commission are Phil Thompson, a deputy mayor; Fred Davie, executive vice president of Union Theological Seminary; K. Bain, executive director of a nonprofit called Community Capacity Development; Ana Bermudez, commissioner of the Department of Probation; Lurie Daniel Favors, interim executive director of Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College; Chris Kui, former executive director of Asian Americans for Equality; Yesenia Mata, executive director of La Colmena, a job center in Staten Island; and Jo-Ann Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation.
The panel is formally known as a charter revision commission, which means it will be empowered to examine the City Charter, and its recommendations could lead to ballot measures.
These commissions have done important work in recent years: This year’s local primary elections, for example, will make use of ranked-choice voting, a result of a charter revision commission. Instead of selecting one choice for mayor, for example, voters can rank as many as five choices.
Other changes born of commissions have included increasing the size of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, establishing new limits on campaign contributions, and setting term limits for community board members.
De Blasio first proposed creating a commission to examine racism last year, as protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others rocked the city. Some activists were disappointed that it took so long for the commission to come together, but city officials said they wanted to get it right and assemble the best group possible.
In December, de Blasio made a rare apology for his response to the protests against police brutality and said he agreed with a report by a city oversight agency that found the police had badly mishandled the protests.
Jones Austin, the commission’s chair, said “the devastation that COVID has brought upon low-income communities of color,” and the killings of Floyd, Taylor and others, had highlighted racial disparities that could no longer be ignored.
“How can we begin to make systemic change?” she said. “You can do one-offs. But you’ve got to look at the document that lays out how government works and how it needs to be revised to make sure that it is inclusive.”
Still, the next mayor will likely have a say in the debate.
Several leading candidates running in the Democratic primary in June have proposed their own ideas to help poor New Yorkers, and it remains to be seen if the next mayor will embrace the commission’s recommendations.
De Blasio said the commission was an extension of the “Tale of Two Cities” theme that shaped his first campaign for mayor and early years in office. He created a universal prekindergarten program and added affordable housing as part of his mission to reduce inequality.
Asked why he had waited until his final year in office to start the commission, the mayor suggested that news events over the past year had made New Yorkers realize that the “entire structure now has to be questioned.”
While New York is believed to be the first major American city to form a reconciliation commission like this one, other cities are taking steps to address racism.
Evanston, Illinois, just north of Chicago, is moving to become the first U.S. city to offer reparations to Black residents. The plan calls for spending $10 million raised from a tax on legalized marijuana to pay for housing and economic programs.
There has been growing momentum for a national campaign to establish reparations. A subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a first-of-its-kind hearing on reparations in 2019 that featured writer Ta-Nehisi Coates.
Other cities are grappling with police reform, and some have embraced the defund the police movement. But even in Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed by police last May, efforts to dismantle the Police Department collapsed. A far less ambitious move — cutting the police budget by 4.5% — was approved in December, disappointing those who had pushed for defunding.

What Are the ‘Kill the Bill’ Protests in Britain All About?

“ Kill the bill! ”
That has been the refrain echoing in streets across Britain in recent weeks as protesters demand a rethinking of a sweeping crime bill that would give the police more power to deal with nonviolent demonstrations.
In recent months, a series of issues have galvanized mass protests across Europe: Black Lives Matter demonstrations in cities last summer, protests against security laws across France last fall, and anti-lockdown rallies seemingly everywhere.
How the police should handle these mass demonstrations has become a topic of heated debate, especially as officers have been accused in some cases of over-aggressive responses. Coronavirus restrictions have added another layer to questions about the right balance between the rule of law and protecting civil liberties.
In Britain, that discussion has zeroed in on the new police bill.
The proposed legislation has come under intense criticism in recent weeks in the wake of the killing of Sarah Everard, a young woman who was murdered in London after walking home from a friend’s house in the evening, and a subsequent vigil to honor her that was broken up by the police.
Here is what you need to know about the proposed policing bill that would affect England and Wales, and the protests demanding that it be shelved.
What would the policing bill do?
The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Court Bill is an immense piece of proposed legislation that makes provisions for a broad range of issues in its nearly 300 pages. The bill — which covers England and Wales — introduces harsher penalties for serious crimes, end a policy of early prison release for some offenders and prevent unauthorized encampments, among other sweeping measures.
It also gives broad authority to police forces when it comes to handling protests — and that has proved to be a lightning rod.
Under current law, the police must first determine that a demonstration could result in serious public disorder, property damage or serious disruption to the life of the community before it can impose restrictions.
But the new bill would offer much broader powers for the police. It will leave much to their own discretion, and potentially allow them to criminalize protests they deem a “public nuisance.”
The police would be allowed to set time and noise limits on rallies, and protesters who do not follow restrictions they “ought” to know about, even if they have not received a direct order from an officer, would be vulnerable to prosecution.
The bill also makes it possible for those who damage memorials to be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. That provision comes months after a statue commemorating a slave trader, Edward Colston, was toppled in Bristol last year during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
There had already been pushback.
The government maintains that the bill provides for better policing and community protection. Priti Patel, the home secretary, said last week that there was “a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of individuals to go about their daily lives.”
“In recent years, we have seen a significant change of protest tactics, with protesters exploiting gaps in the law which have led to disproportionate amounts of disruption,” Patel said, speaking in front of Parliament last week. She pointed specifically to tactics used by Extinction Rebellion climate change protesters to block trains and shut down cities.
Opposition lawmakers and rights groups have denounced what they see as a move to give police overly broad, and potentially problematic, powers. Many say they need more time to work through the potential implications.
The Local Government Association, a cross-party organization, said that certain aspects of the bill, particularly those focused on public protests, “warrant further formal consultation.” The group expressed concerns that a rushed timetable to vote on the bill “left little time to scrutinize the bill in sufficient detail.”
The Good Law Project, a British governance watchdog, said in a briefing that the bill “represents a serious threat to the right to protest,” and called for the portions of the legislation that deal with protests to be dropped.
Why have people taken to the streets now?
While rights groups have long had concerns about the policing bill and its potential impact on what they say is the essential democratic tool of protest, the legislation was suddenly thrust into the national spotlight after the murder of Everard.
The 33-year-old vanished off a London street on March 3, and her body was later found in a wooded area. A police officer was charged in her death.
The killing set off a national outcry over violence against women. Then came the day of the vigil.
Officers were widely criticized for breaking up the March 12 event, deemed illegal because of coronavirus restrictions. Images spread quickly showing the police moving in to halt speeches and arrest a group of women denouncing violence.
An independent investigation has been launched into conduct of the police, and the controversy raised questions about the ban on protests during the pandemic.
More broadly, the police's heavy-handed response to the vigil catalyzed the movement against the policing bill, shifting the debate to one about police overreach. The vigil took place just days before the crime bill was set to be debated in Parliament.
The problem with the bill, critics say, is not just that it gives officers more power to tamp down on demonstrations. The bill makes no specific mention of violence against women — indeed, it includes more language about the defacing of a statue than it does about crimes motivated by misogyny.
A number of protests against the bill have been held nationally since the vigil for Everard in London. Last week, hundreds gathered outside government buildings, with crowds parading from Parliament Square to police headquarters in largely peaceful demonstrations. Other protests were held nationally last weekend.
On Sunday, one of them turned riotous in Bristol, where a small group set fire to police vehicles, smashed shop windows and clashed with officers. At least 20 police officers were injured, two seriously, and seven were arrests made, according to the police.
What happens next?
The bill has already passed one hurdle in Parliament, despite the concerns over civil liberties, when it was voted through during its second reading last week amid heated debate.
Now it goes to committee, when it will be assessed in detail, and experts and interest groups can weigh in. When that is over, the committee will report its findings — and perhaps suggest amendments — to the House of Commons, where it will be debated again.
But that process has been put off until later this year.
The government has tried to use the passions set off by Everard’s death to secure passage of the policing bill. The sweeping new police powers it contains, officials argue, would make women safer.
But many others have argued that the bill misses the point. The measure, they argue, fails to address the pervasive misogyny at the heart of crimes committed against women, as well as undermining the right to protest.
As the dispute has heated up, some lawmakers are taking a new look the bill.
The Labour party had originally planned to abstain from voting on the bill, but shifted its position last week to instead vote against it. David Lammy, a Labour lawmaker who is the opposition party’s justice spokesman, called the legislation “a mess.”
“The tragic death of Sarah Everard has instigated a national demand for action to tackle violence against women,” Lammy said. “This is no time to be rushing through poorly thought-out measures to impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest.”

Late Thursday night, Sisters Uncut, a provocative feminist organization that has emerged as a leader of the most forceful protests in Britain’s growing national movement around women’s safety, declared a small victory.
“We’ve delayed the #PoliceCrackdownBill,” the group announced on Twitter. “This is a victory, but we will not stop.”
The announcement was just the latest evidence that this movement differs from past campaigns that opposed violence against women in general terms but rarely made sweeping demands.
Women are furious not just about the death of Sarah Everard, 33, in London — a police officer has been charged in her kidnapping and killing — but about what they see as a heavy-handed and misogynist response from police afterward. They are directing their anger at law enforcement and the justice system and pushing to scrap a proposed police and crime bill, which would create sweeping new restrictions on protests and grant broad new powers to police, and which ignited violent protests in Bristol on Sunday night.
That position may seem contradictory to some. The police, after all, are often seen as protectors of public safety. When the international Black Lives Matter movement has led to calls to defund or even abolish the police, opponents are quick to cite women’s safety from rape and assault as a reason the police must be preserved.
But if Everard’s death convinced many women in Britain that police were failing to protect them, the violent police action a few days later at a London vigil in her honor, along with the arrest of a police officer over her killing, have led many to conclude that the police are an active threat. Women’s safety and freedom, they argue, can come only from much deeper social changes — and any policy change in response to Everard’s death should focus on those.
Impunity for Sexual Violence
Margaret Atwood famously said that there was nothing in her novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” that did not happen to women somewhere at some point in history. That is often treated as evidence of in-depth sourcing, but in fact it is the force behind the novel’s visceral central horror: that any protection women might think would be offered by democracy, education, wealth or race can all too easily disappear in an instant.
For many women in Britain, Everard’s killing and the police’s violent dispersal of a London vigil in her memory have triggered a similar horror, on a less dystopian scale, about how unprotected they truly are. It has become a moment, too, to reflect on the suffering of women of color and other groups targeted for abuse that has long been ignored.
Raven Bowen, chief executive of National Ugly Mugs, a group that works to prevent violence against sex workers, said she believed that when police broke up the vigil for Everard on Clapham Common last weekend, the women there got “a taste” of the kind of trauma many sex workers have reported experiencing at the hands of police for years.
She believes that such experiences have a cumulative effect. “When they do ask for protection, what do they get?” Bowen asked rhetorically. “That becomes a learned experience.”
Lydia Caradonna, a writer and sex worker, said that she had often encountered the idea that women like herself were not entitled to police protection because “we’ve sacrificed the part of our womanhood that keeps us safe, the part that makes us worthy of protection.”
That, she believes, is why Everard’s death has sent such shock waves. “There’s this idea about proper womanhood,” she said, “that Sarah was a proper woman, she did what she was supposed to, she dressed the way she should” — but none of that was enough to keep her safe.
“It can also be quite a shattering of self when you realize that you did do things right and you still got assaulted,” said Nicole Westmarland, a Durham University researcher who studies violence against women. “That’s what’s happened on a mass international scale, really.”
Rape ‘Has Been Decriminalized’
As public anger grew after the killing of Everard, the government promised new actions to improve women’s safety: more CCTV cameras, better street lighting, and plainclothes police in bars and clubs to watch for attacks on female patrons. And it campaigned for more support for the police and crime bill, which would grant sweeping new powers to police departments across the country.
All those responses seemed grounded in the theory that women felt unsafe because there were not enough police, with enough power, in enough places.
But for many women expressing fear and outrage, especially those at events organized by Sisters Uncut, that was precisely backward. In their view, police were themselves a source of trauma and danger. And giving them more powers would only leave women more vulnerable.
Everard’s death was a single tragedy, and the police action in Clapham last weekend was against one protest. But statistics tell a story of many more widespread failures.
From 2019 to 2020, less than 3% of rapes reported to police were prosecuted, according to government statistics. And if unreported cases are taken into account, the real prosecution rate is even lower.
“Rape has been decriminalized, frankly,” said Emily Gray, a lecturer at Derby University who studies policing.
A 2019 report by the British newspaper The Independent found that 568 London police officers were accused of sexual assault between 2012 and 2018, but only 43 faced disciplinary proceedings. And from April 2015 to April 2018, there were at least 700 reports of domestic violence by police officers and police staff, according to documents obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalists from 37 of Britain’s 48 police forces.
Opponents of the police and crime bill, which would grant the police wide-ranging power to shut down protests, argue that it would make scenes like the one on Clapham Common more frequent and would not stop the most prevalent forms of violence against women.
“Violence against women usually comes from a power imbalance,” Gray said. One reason the police bill is being attacked, she said, is that “it doesn’t do anything about that at all.”
Alternative Solutions
So, what are the alternatives? Different groups tend to focus on different remedies.
Sisters Uncut, which was founded in 2014 in response to government austerity measures that slashed funding for women’s shelters and other help for women at risk, has long demanded that such services be reinstated.
Perpetrator programs, which work intensively with abusive men to prevent them from attacking their partners, have shown some promise in cases where the abusers are committed to change, said Westmarland, who has studied them.
“The physical and sexual abuse reduced quite substantially and in some cases was eliminated altogether,” she said. But she noted that the programs had not been effective at reducing coercive control — the domineering emotional abuse that is the hallmark of domestic violence and that is deeply traumatic in its own right.
One belief that cuts across nearly all the groups involved — including mainstream ones like the Women’s Institute, the largest women’s organization in the country — is that education must be a centerpiece of any change.
Such education could be “a real shot at prevention and shaping some of the prevalent attitudes that greatly hurt girls and women as well as nonbinary people in our society,” Kate Manne, a professor of philosophy at Cornell University and the author of two books on the ways sexism shapes society, said in an interview.
But while education might sound like the kind of anodyne concept that anyone could support, Manne said via text message that she believed it would actually be quietly radical for education to address the politically charged issues of misogyny, male privilege and male responsibility for ending male violence.
“Can you imagine if sex education became political?” she asked. “Sigh. It’s my dream, though.”

Biden’s Aid Package Funnels Millions to Victims of Domestic Abuse

Tucked into President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package are tens of millions of dollars for organizations dedicated to curtailing domestic abuse, which skyrocketed during the pandemic, as well as vouchers for people fleeing violence at home, to help them find safe shelter and rebuild their lives.
These measures are the most concrete signals to date that Biden’s domestic policy agenda will aim to combat domestic abuse, an issue that has long animated his four-decade career in politics.
As a senator, Biden sponsored the bill that became the Violence Against Women Act, the first federal legislation intended to end domestic violence, which the House voted to renew Wednesday. As vice president, he created a position to coordinate federal efforts around abuse and sexual assault. That adviser reported to him.
As president, Biden signed off on a version of the American Rescue Plan that funnels $49 million in aid and hundreds of millions of dollars in housing assistance to victims who have been trapped during the pandemic with their abusers. A senior White House adviser will also focus on gender violence as part of Biden’s newly formed Gender Policy Council.
“The most vicious of all crimes are domestic crimes,” he said in 2009, when he was vice president. “The worst imprisonment in the whole world is to be imprisoned in your own home.”
Expected to be a signature legislative achievement for Biden, the American Rescue Plan has laid the groundwork for sweeping, progressive changes to decades of economic and social policies that have often favored corporations and the rich, with a vast share of the proposal to benefit Americans who are most in need.
Combating domestic abuse is in keeping with that theme. Experts say that intimate partner violence forces victims out of the labor market and leads to greater risk of poverty and homelessness. And abuse is a broad problem that affects 1 in 4 women, 1 in 7 men and countless children, according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
Groups that work to end domestic abuse believe that the Biden administration’s policies could signal a substantive shift in addressing a crisis that cuts across race, class and gender. That he is doing so amid a pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color, and a racial justice and police reform movement that also intersects with issues faced by survivors, has been applauded by advocates.
“For us, imagining that we will have folks in the White House paying attention, not only to violence against women but to these intersections — it is a deep sigh of relief,” said Karma Cottman, the executive director of Ujima, the National Center on Violence Against Women in the Black Community.
Former President Donald Trump’s policies were seen as overtly hostile toward survivors of domestic abuse. His hard-line immigration measures made victims without legal status fear deportation should they seek help, according to some survivors and advocates, and under his watch, the Violence Against Women Act, known as VAWA, was not reauthorized for the first time.
Trump, who himself has been accused of sexual assault and harassment, was also dismissive of claims of abuse. When his White House staff secretary Rob Porter was accused by two former wives of battery, Trump said that he doubted the allegations and sympathized with Porter. Porter denied wrongdoing and resigned.
VAWA, which throughout its 25-year history had broad bipartisan support, lapsed under Trump, in part because Republicans did not believe they could work with the White House on it.
In a 244-172 vote, the House on Wednesday reauthorized a new version of the bill, but its prospects in the Senate are unclear.
Lynn Rosenthal, who served as Biden’s first White House adviser on violence against women and is now overseeing his commission on sexual assault in the military, said his advocacy was “life-changing” for victims. “You can’t overstate the importance of federal leadership on this issue,” she said.
The coronavirus laid bare the social and economic privations that often allow such abuse to thrive, as lockdown restrictions only led to more instances of violence. For many communities, Cottman said, it was “a double pandemic.”
“There’s this sobering reality that there’s so much cleanup that has to happen,” she said.
The rescue plan earmarks $49.5 million to organizations like hers, to provide “culturally specific” support, as the law puts it, for survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault who were affected by the pandemic and other public health concerns.
That kind of targeted funding is crucial, Cottman said, for “small community organizations that are essentially lifesaving in their communities.” Among her goals, she said, is helping survivors obtain personal protective equipment.
Some organizations that support abuse survivors, like FreeFrom, prefer that relief money go directly to those who have been abused, giving them the flexibility to cover expenses that can restore their independence, like day care, transportation or health care. They hope Biden will eventually fulfill his campaign pledge to allocate $5 billion in such cash grants to survivors in need.
A broad analytical study released last month affirmed that the stay-at-home orders issued in response to the pandemic greatly intensified domestic abuse, by cutting victims off from people who could report signs of trouble or help them escape violence, and by exacerbating economic factors often connected with abuse, including unemployment, financial insecurity and substance use.
The analysis, issued by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice, found that domestic abuse reports in the United States increased by more than 8% after the lockdowns began, putting a hard number on what has long been known in anecdotal accounts.
The rescue plan also provides $5 billion in housing vouchers for several at-risk demographic groups, including those fleeing abuse, assault, dating violence and human trafficking. The vouchers, experts say, help address the fact that the vast financial burden of leaving an abusive relationship often begins with housing.
Davida, a 38-year-old woman from North Carolina, did exactly what victims of domestic abuse are instructed to do: The first time her boyfriend hit her, she called the police. She left the apartment that they shared to report the violence in court, and obtained an order of protection, a copy of which she provided to The New York Times. (She spoke on the condition that her last name not be published for her safety.)
After her boyfriend threatened to kill her, Davida said she saw no choice but to abandon her home and flee with her son. Fearing she would be stalked — an exceedingly common scenario, experts said — she wound up in a shelter in another state, a move that cost her a job at a call center, just before the pandemic hit. That single episode, when her boyfriend pummeled her without warning, destabilized her entire life.
Even after a victim escapes an abuser, the situation may be fraught. “Often you’re dealing with a housing lawyer, a custody lawyer, a shelter provider, a counselor, a counselor for children; you might have Child Protective Services involved,” said Liz Roberts, the chief executive of Safe Horizon, a New York service provider. “What we ask of survivors in those situations, and the complexity of the systems they have to navigate, is really daunting.”
With the help of a career-readiness program at Sanctuary for Families, a shelter and service provider, Davida turned an internship into a part-time job. But more than a year after the assault, she and her son are still homeless. “Every day I wake up, I’m starting all over,” she said.
Crisis counselors say that alleviating survivors’ housing issues would help set their recovery on the right track, but vouchers are not the only solution. Federal and local governments could also prioritize their needs by “continuing the moratorium on evictions, and prohibiting street sweeps of people experiencing homelessness, both of which disproportionately affect women fleeing domestic violence,” said Caroline Bettinger-López, a law professor at the University of Miami, who was previously a White House adviser on violence against women.
The resources in the rescue plan for emergency housing assistance are to remain available until 2030.
Cottman called the acknowledgment from the Biden administration a huge moment of inflection. After years in which providers struggled to gain public attention and protect their meager budgets, they can begin to think bigger about how to help survivors.
“We are able to really think about, what are the things that our communities need?” she said. “What are the pieces that we can re-imagine, while at the same time maintaining funds for core services? You can’t do any of this, without ensuring victims and survivors have places to go.”

This year perhaps more than ever before, the college essay has served as a canvas for high school seniors to reflect on a turbulent and, for many, sorrowful year. It has been a psychiatrist’s couch, a road map to a more hopeful future, a chance to pour out intimate feelings about loneliness and injustice.
In response to a request from The New York Times, more than 900 seniors submitted the personal essays they wrote for their college applications. Reading them is like a trip through two of the biggest news events of recent decades: the devastation wrought by the coronavirus, and the rise of a new civil rights movement.
In the wake of the high-profile deaths of Black people like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police officers, students shared how they had wrestled with racism in their own lives. Many dipped their feet into the politics of protest, finding themselves strengthened by their activism, yet sometimes conflicted.
And in the midst of the most far-reaching pandemic in a century, they described the isolation and loss that have pervaded every aspect of their lives since schools suddenly shut down a year ago. They sought to articulate how they have managed while cut off from friends and activities they had cultivated for years.
To some degree, the students were responding to prompts on the applications, with their essays taking on even more weight in a year when many colleges waived standardized test scores and when extracurricular activities were wiped out.
This year the Common App, the nation’s most-used application, added a question inviting students to write about the effect of COVID-19 on their lives and educations. And universities like Notre Dame and Lehigh invited applicants to write about their reactions to the death of George Floyd, and how that inspired them to make the world a better place.
The coronavirus was the most common theme in the essays submitted to The Times, appearing in 393 essays, more than 40%. Next was the value of family, coming up in 351 essays, but often in the context of other issues, like the pandemic and race. Racial justice and protest figured in 342 essays.
“We find with underrepresented populations, we have lots of people coming to us with a legitimate interest in seeing social justice established, and they are looking to see their college as their training ground for that,” said David A. Burge, vice president for enrollment management at George Mason University.
Family was not the only eternal verity to appear. Love came up in 286 essays; science in 128; art in 110; music in 109; and honor in 32. Personal tragedy also loomed large, with 30 essays about cancer alone.
Some students resisted the lure of current events, and wrote quirky essays about captaining a fishing boat on Cape Cod or hosting dinner parties. A few wrote poetry. Perhaps surprisingly, politics and the 2020 election were not of great interest.
Most students expect to hear where they were admitted by the end of March or beginning of April. Here are excerpts from a few of the essays, edited for length.
——
Mary Clare Marshall
During the pandemic, Mary Clare, a student at Sacred Heart Greenwich in Connecticut, realized that her mother had cancer.
My parents acted like everything was normal, but there were constant reminders of her diagnosis. After her first chemo appointment, I didn’t acknowledge the change. It became real when she came downstairs one day without hair.
No one said anything about the change. It just happened. And it hit me all over again. My mom has cancer.
Even after going to Catholic school for my whole life, I couldn’t help but be angry at God. I felt myself experiencing immense doubt in everything I believe in. Unable to escape my house for any small respite, I felt as though I faced the reality of my mom’s cancer totally alone.
Mary Clare has been admitted to the University of Virginia and is waiting on other schools.
Mina Rowland
Mina, who lives in a shelter in San Joaquin County, California, became homeless in middle school.
Despite every day that I continue to face homelessness, I know that I have outlets for my pain and anguish.
Most things that I’ve had in life have been destroyed, stolen, lost, or taken, but art and poetry shall be with me forever.
The stars in “Starry Night” are my tenacity and my hope. Every time I am lucky enough to see the stars, I am reminded of how far I’ve come and how much farther I can go.
After taking a gap year, Mina and her twin sister, Mirabell, have been accepted at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and are waiting to hear from other schools.
Christine Faith Cabusay
Christine, a senior at Stuyvesant High School in New York, came up with a way to break the isolation of the pandemic.
How often would my friends receive something in the mail that was not college mail, a bill, or something they ordered online? My goal was to make opening a letter an experience. I learned calligraphy and Spencerian script so it was as if an 18th-century maiden was writing to them from her parlor on a rainy day.
Washing lines in my yard held an ever-changing rainbow of hand-recycled paper.
With every letter came a painting of something that I knew they liked: fandoms, animals, music, etc. I sprayed my favorite perfume on my signature on every letter because I read somewhere that women sprayed perfume on letters overseas to their partners in World War II; it made writing letters way more romantic (even if it was just to my close friends).
Christine is still waiting to hear from schools.
Ivy Wanjiku
She and her mother came to America “with nothing but each other and $100,” writes Ivy, who was born in Kenya and attends North Cobb High School in Kennesaw, Georgia.
I am a triple threat. Foreign, black, female. From the dirt roads and dust that covered the attire of my ancestors who worshiped the soil, I have sprouted new beginnings for generations.
But the question arises; will that generation live to see its day?
Melanin mistaken as a felon, my existence is now a hashtag that trends as often as my rights, a facade at best, a lie in truth. I now know more names of dead blacks than I do the amendments of the Constitution.
Ivy is going to Emory University in Atlanta on full scholarship and credits her essay with helping her get in.
Ahmed AlMehri
Ahmed, who attends the American School of Kuwait, lost a revered relative to COVID-19.
Fareed Al-Othman was a poet, journalist and, most importantly, my grandfather. Sept. 8, 2020, he fell victim to COVID-19. To many, he’s just a statistic — one of the “inevitable” deaths. But to me, he was, and continues to be, an inspiration. I understand the frustration people have with the restrictions, curfews, lockdowns and all of the tertiary effects of these things.
But I, personally, would go through it all a hundred times over just to have my grandfather back.
For a long time, things felt as if they weren’t going to get better. Balancing the grief of his death, school and the upcoming college applications was a struggle; and my stress started to accumulate. COVID-19 has taken a lot from me, but it has forced me to grow stronger and persevere. I know my grandfather would be disappointed if I had let myself use his death as an excuse to slack off.
Ahmed has been accepted by the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Miami and is waiting to hear from other schools.
Levi Burks
Levi, a student at Westerville Central High School in Ohio, found society confronting a problem that was very personal to her.
Since I was a small child I have watched my father put on his dark blue uniform to go to work protecting and serving others. He has always been my hero. As the African-American daughter of a police officer, I believe in what my father stands for, and I am so proud of him because he is not only my protector, but the protector of those I will likely never know. When I was young, I imagined him always being a hero to others, just as he was to me. How could anyone dislike him??? However, as I have gotten older and watched television and social media depict the brutalization of African-Americans, at the hands of police, I have come to a space that is uncomfortable.
I am certain there are others like me — African-Americans who love their police officer family members, yet who despise what the police are doing to African-Americans.
I know that I will not be able to rectify this problem alone, but I want to be a part of the solution where my paradox no longer exists.
Levi has been accepted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, and is waiting to hear from other schools.
Grace Sundstrom
Through her church in Des Moines, Iowa, Grace, a senior at Roosevelt High School, began a correspondence with Alden, a man who was living in a nursing home and isolated by the pandemic.
As our letters flew back and forth, I decided to take a chance and share my disgust about the treatment of people of color at the hands of police officers. To my surprise, Alden responded with the same sentiments and shared his experience marching in the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
Here we were, two people generations apart, finding common ground around one of the most polarizing subjects in American history.
When I arrived at my first Black Lives Matter protest this summer, I was greeted by the voices of singing protesters. The singing made me think of a younger Alden, stepping off the train at Union Station in Washington, D.C., to attend the 1963 March on Washington.
Grace has been admitted to Trinity University in San Antonio and is waiting on other schools.
Alexis Ihezue
Her father’s death last year caused Alexis, a student at the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science and Technology in Lawrenceville, Georgia, to consider the meaning of love.
And in the midst of my grief swallowing me from the inside out, I asked myself when I loved him most, and when I knew he loved me. It’s nothing but brief flashes, like bits and pieces of a dream. I hear him singing “Fix You” by Coldplay on our way home, his hands across the table from me at our favorite wing spot that we went to weekly after school, him driving me home in the middle of a rainstorm, his last message to me congratulating me on making it to senior year.
It’s me finding a plastic spoon in the sink last week and remembering the obnoxious way he used to eat. I see him in bursts and flashes.
A myriad of colors and experiences. And I think to myself, ‘That’s what it is.’ It’s a second. It’s a minute. That’s what love is. It isn’t measured in years, but moments.
Alexis, accepted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is waiting on other schools.
Henry Thomas Egan
Henry, a student at Creighton Preparatory School in Omaha, Nebraska, attended a protest after the death of George Floyd.
I had never been to a protest before; neither my school, nor my family, nor my city are known for being outspoken. Thousands lined the intersection in all four directions, chanting, “He couldn’t breathe! George Floyd couldn’t breathe!”
In my head, thoughts of hunger, injustice, and silence swirled around.
In my ears, I heard lyrics playing on a speaker nearby, a song by Nina Simone: “To be young, gifted, and Black!” The experience was exceptionally sad and affirming and disorienting at the same time, and when the police arrived and started firing tear gas, I left. A lot has happened in my life over these last four years. I am left not knowing how to sort all of this out and what paths I should follow.
Henry has not yet heard back from colleges.
Anna Valades
Anna, a student at Coronado High School in California, pondered how children learned racism from their parents.
“She said I wasn’t invited to her birthday party because I was black,” my sister had told my mom, devastated, after coming home from third grade as the only classmate who had not been invited to the party. Although my sister is not black, she is a dark-skinned Mexican, and brown-skinned people in Mexico are thought of as being a lower class and commonly referred to as “negros.” When my mom found out who had been discriminating against my sister, she later informed me that the girl’s mother had also bullied my mom about her skin tone when she was in elementary school in Mexico City.
Through this situation, I learned the impact people’s upbringing and the values they are taught at home have on their beliefs and, therefore, their actions.
Anna has been accepted at Northeastern University and is waiting to hear from other schools.
Nandini Likki
Nandini, a senior at the Seven Hills School in Cincinnati, took care of her father after he was hospitalized with COVID-19.
When he came home, my sister and I had to take care of him during the day while my mom went to work. We cooked his food, washed his dishes, and excessively cleaned the house to make sure we didn’t get the disease as well.
It was an especially harrowing time in my life and my mental health suffered due to the amount of stress I was under.
However, I think I grew emotionally and matured because of the experience. My sister and I became more responsible as we took on more adult roles in the family. I grew even closer to my dad and learned how to bond with him in different ways, like using Netflix Party to watch movies together. Although the experience isolated me from most of my friends who couldn’t relate to me, my dad’s illness taught me to treasure my family even more and cherish the time I spend with them.
Nandini has been accepted at Case Western and other schools.
Nora Frances Kohnhorst
Nora, a student at the High School of American Studies at Lehman College in New York, was always “a serial dabbler,” but found commitment in that common pandemic hobby, bread baking.
In March, when normal life stopped, I took up breadmaking. This served a practical purpose. The pandemic hit my neighborhood in Queens especially hard, and my parents were afraid to go to the store. This forced my family to come up with ways to avoid shopping. I decided I would learn to make sourdough using recipes I found online. Initially, some loaves fell flat, others were too soft inside, and still more spread into strange blobs.
I reminded myself that the bread didn’t need to be perfect, just edible.
It didn’t matter what it looked like; there was no one to see or eat it besides my brother and parents. They depended on my new activity, and that dependency prevented me from repeating the cycle of trying a hobby, losing steam, and moving on to something new.
Nora has been admitted to SUNY Binghamton and the University of Vermont and is waiting to hear from other schools.
Gracie Yong Ying Silides
Gracie, a student at Greensboro Day School in North Carolina, recalls the “red thread” of a Chinese proverb and wonders where it will take her next.
Destiny has led me into a mysterious place these last nine months: isolation. At a time in my life when I am supposed to be branching out, the COVID pandemic seems to have trimmed those branches back to nubs. I have had to research colleges without setting foot on them. I’ve introduced myself to strangers through essays, videos, and test scores.
I would have fallen apart over this if it weren’t for my faith.
In Hebrews 11:1, Paul says that “faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” My life has shown me that the red thread of destiny guides me where I need to go. Though it might sound crazy, I trust that the red thread is guiding me to the next phase of my journey.
Gracie has been accepted to St. Olaf College, Ithaca College and other schools.

After Taylor’s Death, Black Engagement in Kentucky Politics Soared

Exactly one year ago, a young woman died as a barrage of police gunfire ripped through the walls of her modest apartment in Louisville, Kentucky. For months, her death went largely unrecognized.
As more people took notice, though, the city was shaken to its core. Protests rocked the downtown area during the summer and fall as demonstrators demanded justice through tears and megaphones and erected a memorial in a prominent square. They prayed together and sang together, chanting, “Say her name!”
Breonna Taylor became a rallying cry, and when no officers were charged in connection with her death, which occurred during a botched drug raid, protesters returned to the streets. Activists were optimistic that the anniversary of her death Saturday would further fuel a promising surge of civic engagement, particularly from Black residents.
“What happened to Breonna Taylor has shaped every aspect of our lives,” said Charles Booker, a former state representative for Louisville. “Her door being kicked in was our door being kicked in. It really has transformed everything.”
Perhaps most visible have been the demonstrations, including one Saturday that drew hundreds of people to Jefferson Square in downtown Louisville. But there have also been new protocols for Louisville officers, a police reform bill that is winding through the state legislature and a more diverse group of people showing interest in politics.
“This isn’t just marching,” said Carmen Jones, a founder of the Black Women’s Collective in Louisville. “We protest with policy, by putting Black folks in office, by pushing for policy change, by helping our community.”
Jecorey Arthur, a 28-year-old Black man who won his election for the Louisville Metro Council last year, said he believed that Taylor’s legacy had been expansive.
“People are starting to look at some of those root causes and have a better understanding of what’s coming up on your Metro Council agenda, what legislation is being filed, who is your Metro Council person,” Arthur said. “Those were questions that people couldn’t answer a year ago.”
Taylor, 26, died in a chaotic scene. Officers broke down her door, firing 32 rounds after her boyfriend shot at them once, saying later that he had thought they were intruders. Three officers were eventually fired, and a grand jury charged one of them, Brett Hankison, with wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighboring apartment.
The FBI is still investigating the case, and Saturday, Robert Brown, the special agent in charge of the agency’s Louisville office, said investigators are committed to reaching an “appropriate conclusion” and are “actively investigating all aspects” of Taylor’s death.
“Even though the COVID pandemic presented several unexpected obstacles, FBI Louisville has made significant progress in the investigation since it was initiated in May 2020,” Brown said in a statement.
On Friday, Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, filed a lawsuit in federal court against 12 current and former members of the Police Department and also the city and county governments. The suit seeks, “compensatory and punitive damages” and alleges that officers used excessive force and unlawfully obtained the search warrant for the apartment.
The anniversary rally Saturday was one of the city’s largest social justice demonstrations since Chief Erika Shields took over the Police Department in January. Department and city leaders shut down several blocks downtown, where demonstrators gathered before beginning a march.
Among them were the families of several other people of color who were fatally shot by police around the country, including Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Danny Ray Thomas in Houston and Sean Monterrosa in Vallejo, California.
“I pray none of you join this fraternity,” Ben Crump, a lawyer representing Taylor’s family, said of the other families gathered in Louisville. “We’ve got to deal with this police use of force, because it’s killing our people.”
Activists and some Kentucky politicians have criticized the Police Department for what they considered heavy-handedness at previous rallies, including liberal use of pepper balls and arrests of peaceful protesters.
Linda Sarsour, a founder of Until Freedom, said she thought the decision to block off streets Saturday could unsettle demonstrators during what should be a somber memorial.
“It just tells me that maybe not that much has changed,” Sarsour said. “They claim it’s for safety reasons, but for us, when we see a lot of law enforcement, visible law enforcement, it sets a tone that they shouldn’t want to set.”
The breakdown of trust has damaged the morale of officers and citizens alike. According to a report on the Police Department’s policies that was published in January, 75% of officers surveyed said they would leave the job if they could. The report also noted a striking lack of diversity: 12.5% of Louisville police officers are Black, compared with 24% of the city’s population.
City officials have made several changes to policing since Taylor’s death, including the banning of no-knock warrants and the establishment of a civilian review board. But some activists are calling for additional officers to face charges.
State Rep. Attica Scott of Louisville said she would write a letter to the U.S. attorney general this week to ask for a full investigation into Taylor’s death.
In Frankfort, the state capital, Scott has seen a dual response to the surge of Black activism.
The state Senate approved a bill Thursday that would, among other things, make it a crime to insult police officers, which many people saw as a direct response to the racial justice movement. But before a recent state House committee hearing for a police reform bill known as “Breonna’s Law,” thousands of people wrote in and called to voice their support.
That grassroots enthusiasm, Scott believes, will be Taylor’s lasting legacy.
“I have never seen Black people, in particular, be as involved with the legislative process,” she said. “That, to me, is exactly what we want out of movements.”

A protester was burning an American flag outside the 2016 Republican convention in Cleveland when Joseph Biggs rushed to attack. Jumping a police line, he ripped the man’s shirt off and “started pounding,” he boasted that night in an online video.
But police charged the flag burner with assaulting Biggs. The city later paid $225,000 to settle accusations that police had falsified their reports out of sympathy with Biggs, who went on to become a leader of the far-right Proud Boys.
Two years later, in Portland, Oregon, a Proud Boy named Ethan Nordean was caught on video pushing his way through a crowd of counterprotesters, punching one of them, then slamming him to the ground, unconscious. Once again, police charged only the other man in the skirmish, accusing him of swinging a baton at Nordean.
Now Biggs, 37, and Nordean, 30, are major targets in a federal investigation. They face some of the most serious charges stemming from the attack on the U.S. Capitol in January: leading a mob of about 100 Proud Boys in a coordinated plan to disrupt the certification of former President Donald Trump’s electoral defeat.
But an examination of the two men’s histories shows that local and federal law enforcement agencies passed up several opportunities to take action against them and their fellow Proud Boys long before they breached the Capitol.
The group’s propensity for violence and extremism was no secret. But the FBI and other agencies had often seen the Proud Boys as they chose to portray themselves, according to more than a half-dozen current and former federal officials: as mere street brawlers who lacked the organization or ambition of typical bureau targets like neo-Nazis, international terrorists and Mexican drug cartels.
Although law enforcements agencies cannot investigate political groups without reasonable suspicion of a crime, some former officials said they were surprised by the Proud Boys’ apparent impunity.
Police officers have appeared at times to side with the Proud Boys, especially when they have squared off against leftists openly critical of law enforcement. Some local officials have complained that without guidance from federal agencies, their police departments were ill-equipped to understand the dangers of a national movement like the group.
To preempt violence by other far-right groups, federal authorities have often used a tactic known as the “knock and talk.” Agents call or confront group members to warn them away from demonstrations, sometimes reviving past criminal offenses as leverage.
Christopher Wray, the FBI director, told a Senate committee this month that agents had done that in the run-up to a pro-Trump rally in Washington on Jan. 6 that preceded the Capitol assault. They contacted “a handful” of people already under criminal inquiry to discourage attendance, he said.
Enrique Tarrio, chair of the Proud Boys, said that federal agents had called or visited him on eight or so occasions before rallies in recent years. But it was never to pressure him to stay away.
Instead, he said, the agents asked for march routes and other plans in order to separate the Proud Boys from counterprotesters. Other times, agents warned they had picked up potential threats from the left against him or his associates.
But before the Jan. 6 event, no one contacted the leaders of the Proud Boys, Tarrio said: “They did not reach out to us.”
‘Disavow, Disavow, Disavow’
In summer 2017, neo-Nazis, Klansmen and other white supremacists gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia, to announce their resurgence at the “Unite the Right” rally. Its organizer, Jason Kessler, was a member of the Proud Boys.
The group had been founded a year earlier by Gavin McInnes, now 50, the co-creator of the media outlet Vice. (The company has long since severed all ties.) He was a Canadian turned New Yorker with a record of statements attacking feminists and Muslims.
The Proud Boys had been volunteering as bodyguards for right-wing firebrands like Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos and frequently clashed with left-wing crowds. Proud Boys “free speech” rallies in bastions of the left like Seattle, Portland or Berkeley, California, routinely ended in street fights.
Yet McInnes shunned the Unite the Right gathering, saying in an online video, “Disavow, disavow, disavow.” By his account, the Proud Boys were not white supremacists but merely “Western chauvinists.” That stance helped the Proud Boys evade scrutiny from federal law enforcement.
The rally turned violent; a participant drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one and injuring more than a dozen.
Despite McInnes’ cautions, several prominent Proud Boys attended, including Tarrio. But members cite his role to argue that the Proud Boys are not racially exclusive: Tarrio’s background is Afro Cuban, making him one of the rare nonwhite faces in the group.
The group, whose total membership is unknown but believed to be in the thousands, has never articulated a specific ideology or dogma. Its rallies, though, feature hypernationalist chants about immigration, Islam and Trump. Their events often appear to be thinly disguised pretexts to bait opponents into confrontations. The Proud Boys have made little effort to hide violent intentions.
Career officials in federal enforcement have complained that the Trump administration sought to divert investigative resources toward poorly defined threats from the left, such as the movement of violence-prone activists known as antifa.
Yet the Proud Boys’ belligerence fit the definition of terrorism, other officials said: unlawful violence and intimidation for political aims. Members raised money to travel across state lines to dozens of rallies with the intent of street fighting, at least once explicitly targeting a Muslim community in upstate New York for harassment — activities that could have justified the scrutiny of federal law enforcement.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the group.
Nordean became one of the group’s marquee stars, mainly through a viral video of his 2018 knockout punch in Portland.
An amateur bodybuilder who had once trained to be a Navy SEAL, Nordean first encountered the Proud Boys in 2017, during a scuffle in Seattle with immigrant rights demonstrators.
In June 2018, Nordean went to Portland. After a so-called Freedom and Courage rally at a federal building, dozens of members marched around the block to confront waiting counterprotesters. Video footage showed Nordean shoving one to the ground before another, David Busby, approached with a metal baton.
By then a street-fighting veteran, Nordean had put shin guards on his forearms to prepare for combat. Deflecting the baton with one arm, he delivered a right hook to Busby’s jaw that knocked him unconscious, then threw the man to the ground. Busby was hospitalized with a “significant concussion,” a police report noted.
On six Facebook pages the group uses to vet new recruits, the number of prospective members jumped more than 70% over the next 30 days, adding more than 820 potential Proud Boys, said Cassie Miller, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center. The number of active chapters around the country exploded, increasing from three in 2017 to about 44 by the end of 2018, according to a count by the center.
Two other Proud Boys were arrested that day for violence during previous clashes. But Nordean was not. He “claimed he exercised his right to defend himself and others,” the police report noted. The department declined to comment, as did Nordean’s lawyer.
Biggs, the future Proud Boys leader who attacked the flag burner in Cleveland, was a barrel-chested Army veteran. He got his start on the far-right working as an Infowars correspondent, which is how he encountered Nordean and the Proud Boys.
Biggs’ record of violence predated his affiliation with the group. He was arrested in North Carolina on a domestic violence charge in 2007; prosecutors dropped the case after his wife failed to appear as a witness. He was convicted of resisting arrest in South Carolina in 2012 and sentenced to probation. And he was arrested in early 2016, accused of assaulting a security officer outside his apartment in Austin, Texas.
Biggs was at the Republican convention in Cleveland as a correspondent for Infowars when he attacked the flag burner, Gregory Johnson, now 64.
A member of the Communist Party, he had been the plaintiff in the landmark 1989 Supreme Court case Johnson v. Texas, which established that the First Amendment protected flag burning.
Although video recordings indicated that Biggs started the melee by pummeling Johnson, a police officer said in an affidavit that Johnson “caused two media members to get burned by the fire” — Biggs and an Infowars colleague.
A lawyer for Biggs declined to comment.
Trump adviser Roger Stone, an Infowars regular, introduced Biggs to Tarrio, the Proud Boys chair, and by 2019 he had started helping him organize events. In August, Biggs helped organize an “End Domestic Terrorism” rally in Portland. FBI agents pulled Biggs and Tarrio aside at the Portland airport but did not ask them to stay away from the rally, the Proud Boys chair recalled.
Instead, he explained, the agents warned the two Proud Boys of threats against them from antifa activists.
At the end of 2020, as Trump was trying to overturn his election loss, Biggs and Tarrio marched at the head of hundreds of Proud Boys during a pro-Trump “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington.
Washington police arrested Tarrio on Jan. 4, charging him with illegal possession of two high-capacity magazines for an AR-15. But authorities released him on condition he stay out of the District of Columbia during the Trump rally two days later. No other Proud Boys were arrested in connection with the incident.
The Proud Boys made no effort to hide their anticipation of political violence in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. “If there ever was a time for there to be a second civil war, it’s now,” Biggs wrote in a blog post shortly after the election. “Buy ammo, clean your guns, get storable food and water.”
Nordean, meanwhile, used social media to solicit donations for “protective gear” and “communications equipment,” court papers say. After Tarrio was expelled from Washington, according to prosecutors, the Proud Boys tapped Nordean to assume “war powers” and lead them at the Capitol. (It is unclear exactly what “war powers” referred to.)
The 100-strong mob behind Biggs and Nordean was almost certainly the single largest organized group that took part in the attack, and prosecutors said its members spearheaded the violence. One Proud Boy, Dominic Pezzola, was among the first to shatter a window and break into the Capitol, court papers say.
Federal agents have now executed search warrants on Proud Boys in four states. Prosecutors have so far accused 10 members of crimes, including destruction of government property and threatening a federal officer. They are now seeking to link as many as possible in an overarching conspiracy indictment.

George Floyd’s Family Settles Suit Against Minneapolis for $27 Million

The family of George Floyd, the Black man whose death set off a wave of protests after a video showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes last May, has settled a lawsuit against Minneapolis for $27 million, city officials said on Friday.
The City Council voted unanimously to approve the settlement, and a spokeswoman for the city said Mayor Jacob Frey would sign the measure.
The settlement was among the largest in a case of police misconduct, and was announced as Derek Chauvin, the former officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, sat less than 1 mile away in a courtroom as jurors were being chosen for his trial. He has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
It also came after several other large settlements in high-profile police killings, including a $12 million payout in September from Louisville, Kentucky, over its officers’ killing of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, last March.
Minneapolis had previously paid one of the largest settlements in a police misconduct lawsuit in May 2019, when the city agreed to pay $20 million to the family of Justine Ruszczyk, a white yoga instructor who was fatally shot by Mohamed Noor, a Black Minneapolis police officer, in 2017.
Floyd’s family had sued the City of Minneapolis in July, saying that the police had violated his rights and failed to properly train its officers or fire those who violated department policies.
“It was the knee of the entire Minneapolis Police Department on the neck of George Floyd that killed him,” Ben Crump, the prominent civil rights lawyer who is among those representing Floyd’s family, said at the time.
The $27 million includes a $500,000 donation to “the community” at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, the corner where the police had confronted Floyd over a convenience store clerk’s claim that he had tried to use a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes, and where a bystander captured the arrest on a video that brought worldwide attention to his death.

LAPD Mishandled George Floyd Protests, Report Finds

The Los Angeles Police Department severely mishandled protests last summer in the wake of George Floyd’s death, illegally detaining protesters, giving conflicting orders to its rank-and-file officers and striking people who had committed no crimes with rubber bullets, bean bags or batons, according to a new report released Thursday.
The department was not prepared for the protests to become violent despite similar turns in other cities, the 101-page report commissioned by the City Council said, and once officers were confronted with the violence, they quickly lost control, failing to rein in much of the most destructive behavior while arresting protesters for minor offenses.
The review of the LAPD is the latest to find serious fault with a police department’s response to the wave of protests that swept the country in the wake of Floyd’s death on May 25, and it comes as the officer whose actions set off the unrest, Derek Chauvin, goes on trial in Minneapolis.
The report was also highly critical of the department’s leadership, saying that high-ranking officers sometimes made chaotic scenes even worse by shifting strategies without communicating. In many cases, officers used “antiquated tactics” that failed to calm the more violent demonstrators.
Undercover officers who infiltrated the protests had no way to report criminal behavior directly to supervisors and sometimes had to be rescued from the devolving crowd, the report said, adding that the department’s intelligence operations have become less effective as positions in that field were cut in favor of patrol units.
And while officers arrested thousands of people during the protests in late May, there was no clear plan for how to detain and process them, according to the report. In many cases, the police wrongly arrested protesters under a law that did not allow them to take the people into custody. Some protesters were injured so severely by “less lethal” munitions that they had to get surgery. The LAPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
The review is one of three that has been investigating the LAPD response to the demonstrations, and it was completed by a panel of former police commanders and led by Gerald Chaleff, a veteran Los Angeles attorney who has served on police oversight panels in Los Angeles dating back to the city’s 1992 riots.
“There was a lack of preparation, a lack of planning,” Chaleff said of the LAPD in an interview, adding that the department “could have minimized” the destruction caused by a small group of people who stole from stores and vandalized the city during the protests.
He said most members of the protests were peaceful, but that “there were some people there to create chaos and cause problems.”
The New York Police Department, the nation's largest police force, faced similar criticism last year when both the New York state attorney general and New York City’s own watchdog issued scathing reports saying the department badly mishandled the mass demonstrations last summer.
Key to the New York Police Department’s failure was a lack of training among the police officers sent to patrol the marches, according to a report issued by the city’s Department of Investigation in December.
“The response really was a failure on many levels,” Margaret Garnett, the commissioner for the New York City Department of Investigation, said at the time.
Many officers were not trained in proper crowd control tactics and often engaged in “excessive enforcement” that inflamed tensions, the agency’s report said. That approach led to violent clashes between peaceful demonstrators and the police.
Enforcement during the height of New York City’s protests was overly aggressive and disproportionately impacted people of color, according to a separate report issued by Letitia James, the New York state attorney general. More than 2,000 people were arrested during the city’s first week of demonstrations, and of those arrests, Black and Latino protesters were more likely to be charged with a felony than white protesters, according to James’ report. Her office received more than 1,300 reports of police misconduct stemming from those first weeks of protest in New York City, she said.
Chaleff, who once served as the LAPD’s special assistant for constitutional policing under former Chief William J. Bratton, who later led the NYPD, noted that the report was primarily concerned with the LAPD’s institutional response, not with any particular incident of police misconduct, a sign that the police had “allowed less violence” than in the past.
“I think there’s been progress,” he said. “But you have to be prepared for what’s coming, and you have to have the elected and appointed leadership that understands what is required and creates a culture for the kinds of responses that are necessary.”

Full text: If you have been drinking too much while looking at pictures of real life (or at least Instagram life), if you spend more time talking to machines than living creatures, if you've been wondering if you're alive, if you have an itch you can't scratch, if you think you have a condition called accelerating decrepitude, if you live in a building of empty apartments, there may be a movie that speaks to you, and that movie came out almost 40 years ago. It's called "Blade Runner."
Since its 1982 debut, "Blade Runner," set in a phosphorescent, futuristic Los Angeles and directed by Ridley Scott, has tempted fans to see it as coming to life, well, everywhere. The film's motifs -- gorgeously derelict prewar high-rises, the aesthetic influence of Asia's megacities, massive LED screens -- have become visual shorthand for The Future: Down and Out (but Dark and Sexy) Version.
Purists insist that it is a Los Angeles movie, but posts tagged #bladerunner linked to places as disparate as Istanbul, Tijuana, Milan, Nairobi and Detroit typically appear on Instagram every 10 minutes or so.
Few of those places resemble the movie as much as still mostly locked-down Manhattan, where a starker, lonelier, more class-riven update of the film's retro-noir mood has taken hold. The filmmakers behind "Blade Runner" originally found inspiration in New York, and that was before the city incarnated its post-apocalyptic setting in which "anyone with the wherewithal has presumably gone away," as Janet Maslin wrote in 1982. "Only the dregs remain."
Adrian Benepe, the former New York City Parks Commissioner and current head of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, sees "creeping Blade Runner syndrome" everywhere, from the clogged skies over Manhattan to the subways, which he rides to work every day from his home on the Upper West Side.
"They're empty," Mr. Benepe said. "I've been alone many times at rush hour. It's eerie as hell." He also finds the movie prescient in its depiction of a world saturated by intrusive, omnipresent advertising.
"Places in New York that used to not have advertising now have ads," he said. "You can't get away from it. It's in the subways, it's on the streets, it's on barges. You never stop being assailed."
Giant screens are nothing new, of course. But New York's streetscape had been permeated as never before with twitchy, adhesively catchy LEDs, a trend that has only accelerated during the pandemic, with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announcing last summer the addition of 9,000 screens broadcasting "Covid-relevant safety information."
"There is advertising everywhere, and it's a bit of sensory overload," said Ben Kallos, a City Council member who represents Manhattan's East Side. Mr. Kallos said LinkNYC, the network of 1,800 sidewalk kiosks around the city providing free Wi-Fi as well as block after block of eye-level digital content, "is pushing the boundary" when it comes to "the amount of advertising people are willing to take."
That said, for all its complexity and clutter, New York's visual environment is carefully calibrated by zoning codes and the desire of advertisers not to trigger associations with images such as the "Blade Runner" signature motif of a geisha's face beaming down from a hovering blimp, let alone the monolithic Big Brother figure in Apple's infamous "1984" commercial (also directed by Mr. Scott).
Slip-ups happen, however. Last summer, during protests over the killing of George Floyd, marchers who had gathered near Columbus Circle were shocked to see messages from a billboard overhead sternly telling them to go home and "Don't be a criminal."
"They were telling people that this isn't what George Floyd would want, things like that," said Frederick Joseph, a marketing and communications specialist who is also the author of the recently published New York Times best seller "The Black Friend."
Mr. Joseph was marching beneath the 32-foot-high digital sign -- the only such billboard facing Central Park -- and was shocked to see the messages accompanied by the face of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, along with a misleading Twitter handle. (The Moinian Group, a real estate developer that owns the billboard, did not answer several calls.)
"There was a countdown basically saying how much time before you were past curfew," Mr. Joseph added. "And when it got to like 10 minutes before, people started running. It felt like something out of 'The Hunger Games,' or 'Blade Runner."'
Not all of the resemblances to the movie are nightmarish. The retro-noir look "Blade Runner" is credited with has inspired copycats, including Anthony Bourdain, who before his death planned to open a "Blade Runner"-inspired "Asian night market" on the West Side of Manhattan, and Raf Simons, whose 2018 men's wear show on a steamy, neon-lit night under the Williamsburg Bridge featured models in monklike cocoon coats carrying clear plastic umbrellas.
Indeed, one of the subversive triumphs of "Blade Runner" is making techno-fascist dystopia seductive.
"It's supposed to be terrible, but of course it's mesmerizing," said James Sanders, the author of "Celluloid Skyline: New York and the Movies." Mr. Sanders said that "Blade Runner" originally spoke to a "terror that white middle-class culture was going to be overrun by foreigners."
Some parts of Midtown are incontestably gloomy, such as along Lexington Avenue in the 40s, where mannequins seem to outnumber humans, space-helmeted bicyclists swerve around heaps of garbage, and like a jellyfish glowing undersea, any gleam of life only underscores the vacuum."
Just a half-mile south, though, in Manhattan's Koreatown, the feel is warmer, if slightly edgy, as restaurants have transformed 32nd Street into a vogue-ish outdoor bazaar where you may not feel comfortable unless you're wearing a neoprene cocoon coat with nozzles for the attachment of heating tubes. It's not just the diners slurping seolleongtang inside plywood shacks, the cosmetic treatments on offer up glowing stairwells, or the puddles at the diners' feet (which, although not runoff from acid rain as in "Blade Runner," may be something worse from nearby Midtown).
Scott Geres is the general manager of the Edison Hotel, a Jazz Age showpiece that opened in 1931, when Thomas Edison himself turned on the 26-story building's lights. Pixelated models' faces projected from Times Square flood many of its 810 rooms, including the Presidential Suite, where Aaron Judge, the New York Yankees right fielder, spent the 2018 season.
For the last year, Mr. Geres has been one of the few people at the Edison.
"For the first month I didn't leave the building," said Mr. Geres, 48, who walks up to 25,000 steps a day checking for pipe leaks and fire hazards. "There used to be 5,000 people in this building on a Saturday night. Now it's just me and one other person on my team."
Mr. Geres said his job is to keep the Edison's lights flickering behind the plywood shielding windows on the Rum Bar and street-side restaurants. The 700-room Paramount hotel, across West 47th Street, however, is "dark dark," he said, like so many buildings in Midtown.
"Dark dark" is of course the psychic state of much of New York these days, and of Rick Deckard's mind. In "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep," the 1968 novel by Philip K. Dick on which "Blade Runner" is based, Mr. Deckard is tormented by empty apartments -- "sometimes he heard them when he was supposed to be asleep."
Childless, communicating via "vidphone," and drinking himself into oblivion (with Vangelis's blissfully narcotic score playing in the background, who wouldn't?), Mr. Deckard spends his time when not hunting fugitive robots -- whose vivacity is a rebuke to his own shrunken soul -- looking at pictures from before times, specifically, snapshots of possibly imaginary family members.
It's an on-the-nose image of loneliness and lassitude for those "living in the screen bunker," as the pop psychologist Rob Henderson has called pandemic life. Meanwhile, outside the bunker, intimations of creeping disorder conjure the city of the 1970s, one of the main inspirations for "Blade Runner."
"I was spending a lot of time in New York," Mr. Scott has said of the movie's filming. "The city back then seemed to be dismantling itself. It was marginally out of control."
At that time, Mr. Scott frequently found himself flying directly to Midtown via a helicopter service from Kennedy Airport that would land atop the former Pan-American (now MetLife) Building straddling Park Avenue. Not long afterward, following a grisly accident, the helicopter service was discontinued.
Mr. Benepe sees helicopters as another way "Blade Runner"speaks to the moment.
"In 'Blade Runner' you have this overhead traffic constantly circling overhead," he said. "Well, now the ultrawealthy, not only are they no longer in mass transit with us, they're not even on the roadways. They're flying in from the Hamptons."
He pointed out that the helicopter charter service Blade recently announced a daily commuter run, set to begin this month, shuttling passengers to Manhattan from Westchester.
"Blade Runner"'s class critique is not subtle. A sex worker hunted by Mr. Deckard tries to kill him with his tie. The movie's arch-villain, the head of an evil biotech corporation, lives at the pinnacle of a Pharaonic temple, and apparently he's the only character in the movie whose apartment gets sunlight.
That home, towering above the city, is as spacious and warm as the other interiors are dismal and claustrophobic. Though, in one of the ways "Blade Runner" seems dated, compared with Pharaonic apartments in Manhattan nowadays, its proportions are not extravagant.

A Rochester, New York, police officer tackled and used pepper spray on a woman who had been accused of shoplifting and was with her young daughter last month, according to police body camera videos of the episode that were released Friday.
It was the latest in a series of violent altercations between officers and Black residents that have heightened racial tensions in the city.
The videos of the woman’s arrest threatened to further tarnish the reputation of the police department, which is already under fire for handcuffing and using a chemical irritant on a 9-year-old girl in January and for the death of Daniel Prude, a Black man who died after officers put a hood over his head and pressed his head to the pavement.
“It feels like our officers are out of control,” Mary Lupien, a City Council member, said in an interview.
A bystander’s video of the woman's arrest first appeared on Facebook Feb. 22, the day the incident occurred. But Friday, police released the officer’s body camera footage and a video from a nearby security camera in response to demands from the city’s Police Accountability Board, which reviews misconduct.
Employees at a Rite Aid pharmacy called police about 4:30 p.m. that day after the woman refused to leave the store and knocked items to the floor, officials said. The body camera video shows officers stopping the woman, who is holding her toddler, outside the store.
“Did you steal from that store?” an officer asks the woman. “Oh come on, they said you stole. What’d you take? Tell me the truth!”
The woman can be seen putting her daughter down and opening her purse to show the contents to the officer, the videos show. The officer demands that she wait while he speaks to store employees, but she runs across the street, gripping her child’s hand.
The officer catches her in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant and knocks her to the ground as the child begins to scream, the videos show. A second officer arrives and carries the toddler several feet away. The woman gets to her feet and tries to grab the girl.
Then, footage from a nearby security camera shows, the first officer sprays the woman quickly in the face with pepper spray before taking her to the ground again and putting her in handcuffs. For a moment, the child is suspended between her mother and an officer before her mother lets go of her.
The child was not sprayed, officials said.
Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan, Rochester’s interim chief of police, said at a news conference Friday that the incident was under investigation but that it appeared the officers had followed department policies. The police, she said, “are authorized to the extent necessary to use certain tactics to get a person under control.”
Herriott-Sullivan described the tussle over the little girl as the officer’s attempt to get the child out of harm’s way.
“They have taken the child to try to protect her and get her out of the way so she is not hurt,” she said.
Herriott-Sullivan took over the department’s top leadership role after her predecessor, La’Ron Singletary, was fired amid allegations that he had participated in a cover-up related to Prude’s death.
Neither the woman nor the officers involved in the altercation were identified. One of the officers has been assigned to administrative duty, Herriott-Sullivan said. The woman was charged with trespassing, she said.
Police officials said the two officers were among a group that responded to a domestic violence call Jan. 29 that led to the handcuffing and pepper-spraying of a 9-year-old Black girl. Several officers who were involved in that episode have been placed on administrative leave; at least one was suspended.
The police chief’s efforts to play down the woman’s arrest rang hollow for some Rochester residents. The city was rocked by protests last summer after the circumstances of Prude’s death became public. That unrest returned briefly last week, when a grand jury declined to charge the officers in Prude’s death after an investigation by the attorney general.
Shani Wilson, chair of the Police Accountability Board, said the police had never informed the board about the February episode and that she had pressed for the release of the body camera footage after stumbling across the bystander video on social media.
“How would we have even known?” Wilson said. “We are finding out about incidents in the public like everyone else and we are supposed to be the police reform board that is supposed to be changing how we police the citizens here. That’s not how this should work.”
In a statement, Mayor Lovely Warren described the videos as “disturbing.” She said the department was moving quickly on a police reform plan ordered by Gov. Andrew Cuomo last year after protests erupted across the United States after the death of George Floyd and other Black people at the hands of the police.
“Change will not come until we have the ability to fully hold our officers accountable when they violate the public’s trust,” Warren said.
Andre Anderson, the city’s executive deputy chief of police, said the department was introducing new training initiatives that would address issues like “compassion fatigue,” among officers. Also in the works, he said, were new policies for when it is appropriate to handcuff children and the proper approach to detaining people with mental health problems.
Both Prude and the woman who was involved in the Feb. 22 altercation appeared to have mental health issues when they were being arrested, police said.
“When we respond to a person in crisis, our priority is to help that person,” Anderson said. “While we may have to get them detained, we need to get them help.”

‘Nobody Is in Charge’: Capitol’s Secretive Police Board Faces Overhaul After Riot

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — The congressional inquiry into the security failures surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol assault has barely begun, but one outcome already seems certain: The Capitol Police Board, the secretive three-member panel that oversees protection of the complex where Congress meets, is headed for major changes, if not outright elimination.
Lawmakers of both parties in the House and Senate, some previously unfamiliar with the sweeping authority of the board, have expressed astonishment at its lack of accountability and its inability to rapidly respond to the riot at the Capitol.
“It seems nonfunctioning to me,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., chair of the House Appropriations Committee, which controls money for Capitol security. “Nobody is in charge. When something goes wrong, no one has the ultimate responsibility.”
Like many things on Capitol Hill, the board is a remnant of the past that has survived in large part because it suits those who hold power in Congress. A long line of House and Senate leaders in both parties have favored its existence because they handpick two of its three voting members, giving them tremendous influence over security operations with little public scrutiny.
New tension over the board’s power emerged Thursday as Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting chief of the Capitol Police, appealed to House and Senate leaders to intercede to persuade the panel to grant her department’s emergency request to extend the deployment of National Guard troops at the Capitol. She said the board had not acted on a plea she made in mid-February for authorization to retain about half the force, prompting confusion about the security status at the Capitol.
After Pittman’s letter to the leaders became public, the board gave its approval. But the episode was reminiscent of events in the runup to Jan. 6, when the panel rebuffed a request from the Capitol Police for National Guard reinforcements to counter a threat that had been identified by intelligence, with disastrous consequences.
The 150-year-old board is a vestige of the days when the Capitol grounds were patrolled by a few watchmen. Its capabilities have not kept up with the explosive growth of the department, traditional police force management or the contemporary threat environment, resulting in disarray and inaction Jan. 6 and in the days leading up to the riot.
Under the current system, the board has broad authority for Capitol security and the police force and consists of the sergeants-at-arms of the House and Senate, who are chosen by the leader of each chamber, and the architect of the Capitol, the Senate-confirmed official responsible for buildings and other facilities on the grounds. The chief of the Capitol Police, who must be approved by the board, is a nonvoting member.
At House and Senate hearings in recent days, lawmakers have been struck by the fact that two days before the attack, members of the board dismissed the Capitol Police request for troops to be on hand Jan. 6. They acted with no vote, little discussion or consultation with other authorities and no involvement by the architect of the Capitol. Then on the day of the riot, board members struggled to connect and agree to declare an emergency so that troops who were standing by to assist could be summoned to the Capitol.
“If the police chief feels he doesn’t have the authority to even call in the National Guard in the middle of an insurrection and has to call two people in the middle of doing their jobs guarding members, we have a problem,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chair of the Rules Committee, which is investigating the assault with the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “You need a different structure, or you at least need a very clear line of authority that allows the police chief to make these decisions.”
On Thursday, the lack of coordination was apparent once again. In her letter to congressional leaders, Pittman said the board had yet to sign off on her request to keep the National Guard presence, instead sending her a “white paper” that instructed her to secure the Capitol with the minimum possible number of troops and begin dismantling fencing around the complex. She added that she could not tell if the directives from the board were “mandates or recommendations and if it represents the opinions of the entire board.”
She later announced that she had been granted permission to formally request that the troops remain.
The Capitol Police force was formed in 1828 and the board was created in 1867, when supervision of the police was shifted from the commissioner of public buildings to the sergeants-at-arms of the two chambers. The board’s role has remained fairly consistent since, with the Senate and House officials granted wide responsibility for overseeing the police, the Capitol grounds and the safety of lawmakers.
With Congress exempt from most public disclosure requirements, the board has operated mainly behind closed doors, slow to respond even to requests from the congressional committees that control security spending.
Even before the assault, the board was the subject of criticism by lawmakers for its lack of transparency and responsiveness. But members of Congress tread carefully around the board because of a tendency to defer to security officials on Capitol Hill.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report requested by lawmakers who oversaw funding for the police faulted the board for lack of openness and for not following widely accepted management practices. It said the unique structure of the board hindered the watchdog function of Congress and that lawmakers “saw the bicameral structure as a factor limiting accountability.”
“For example,” the report said, “a single committee cannot call all of the board members to a committee hearing because one of the two sergeants-at-arms is not under that chamber’s jurisdiction,” it said.
The report also noted that the board must declare an emergency before calling for help, a critical contributor to the problems Jan. 6, since it was the board’s failure to agree on an emergency declaration Jan. 4 that left the department without sufficient personnel and immediate backup during the riot.
Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the senior Republican on the Rules Committee, said the Capitol assault underscored long-standing problems with the police board that necessitate major changes.
“I don’t think it works well in the best of circumstances, and I think it’s almost totally unworkable in crisis, and Jan. 6 was a great example of that,” Blunt said.
The two sergeants-at-arms on the board Jan. 6 — Paul Irving from the House and Michael Stenger from the Senate — resigned immediately after the riot, along with Chief Steven Sund of the Capitol Police. They are participating in the review of what happened.
Stenger said he too saw a need for changes in the board to make it a “little more nimble.”
“There’s a lot of statutes out there in the Capitol Police Board that go back many, many years,” he told the two Senate committees investigating the Capitol assault. “It’s probably not a bad time or idea to take a look at what’s there.”
Klobuchar offered a tart response: “That’s probably an understatement with what happened,” she said. “But thank you.”
Without more research, Blunt said he was not yet ready to talk about how to reconfigure the management of Capitol security and the Police Department, which is now seeking a significant budget increase and hundreds of new officers.
“I think there are a number of options, and I haven’t settled on one yet,” he said.
But significant change is coming for the board, long a little-scrutinized Capitol Hill power center.
“It absolutely has to be restructured,” DeLauro said.

House Democrats pushed through a sweeping expansion of federal voting rights Wednesday over unified Republican opposition, opening a new front in a raging national debate about elections aimed at countering GOP attempts to clamp down on ballot access.
The bill, adopted 220-210, mostly along party lines, would constitute the most significant enhancement of federal voting protections since the 1960s if it became law. It aims to impose new national requirements weakening restrictive state voter ID laws, mandate automatic voter registration, expand early and mail-in voting, make it harder to purge voter rolls and restore voting rights to former felons — changes that studies suggest would increase voter participation, especially by racial minorities.
The vote was the latest bid by Democrats to beat back Republican efforts in statehouses across the country to enact new barriers to voting that would consolidate power for the GOP amid false claims of rampant election fraud heralded by former President Donald Trump and many of his allies in Congress.
But the measure, which is supported by President Joe Biden, appears to be doomed for now in the Senate, where Republican opposition would make it all but impossible to draw the 60 votes needed to advance. Democratic leaders have vowed to put it up for a vote anyway, and progressives were already plotting to use Republican obstruction of the bill to build their case for jettisoning the legislative filibuster in the months ahead.
“Everything is at stake. We must win this race, this fight,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said as Democrats rallied on the Capitol steps before the vote. “At the same time as we are gathering here to honor our democracy, across the country over 200 bills are being put together, provisions are being put forward to suppress the vote.”
The 791-page bill, designated HR 1 by Democrats to reflect its importance to their agenda, would also eliminate partisan gerrymandering, impose new transparency on dark money used to finance campaigns, tighten government ethics standards and create a public financing option for congressional campaigns.
The prominence of the debate demonstrated the immense stakes of the fight over election laws, both for how Americans exercise their right to vote and for how both parties aggregate political power. While Congress has worked for decades to expand access to the ballot, often with bipartisan support, the issue has become a sharply partisan one in recent years, as shifting demographics and political coalitions have led Republicans to conclude that they benefit from lower voter participation rates, particularly around cities.
“You can win on the basis of your ideas and the programs you put forward, which is what we choose to do,” said Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., a leading author of the bill. “Or you can try to win by suppressing the vote, drawing unfair districts across the country and using big money to spread disinformation.”
Republicans made remarkably similar arguments but sought to turn them back on Democrats. While they did not outright argue for making it harder to vote, they said that states — not the federal government — were best positioned to determine how to conduct their elections with integrity, and that the bill would lead to rampant fraud benefiting liberal candidates.
Study after study, including by Trump’s own Justice Department, has concluded no widespread fraud exists.
“In this country, if the people who win elections want to hold onto power, they need to perform well, pass sound policies and earn the support of the voters again,” said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. “House Democrats do not get to take their razor-thin majority — which voters just shrunk — and use it to steamroll states and localities to try and prevent themselves from losing even more seats next time.”
For now, Republicans appear to have the upper hand.
States under conservative control have succeeded in recent years in imposing new strictures that studies suggest disproportionately affect Black voters and those living in urban areas. Proponents argue that the steps are necessary to combat potential election fraud. But the effort has been turbocharged in some places since Trump’s loss in November, with states racing to strengthen voter ID laws, to make it harder to vote by mail or vote early, and to limit the role outside groups can play in helping Americans vote.
And on Tuesday, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court signaled it was likely to uphold two restrictive Arizona election measures and potentially chip away further at the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A 2013 ruling by the justices struck down key enforcement provisions in the law and helped pave the way for the success of many Republican-led states in putting in place new rules.
All told, state lawmakers have introduced more than 250 bills in 43 states that would tighten voting rules, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. The most prominent may be Georgia, where Republican leaders reeling from Democrats’ unexpected statewide victories have unabashedly sought to clamp down on ballot access by advancing sharp limits to voting by mail and early voting on Sundays, when many Black voters cast ballots after church services.
“Standing in line to vote is not voter suppression,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from the state, said Wednesday during the debate in Washington. “It’s just part of the voting process. Just like people stand in line to buy groceries at the grocery store.”
Final consideration of the voting bill took place just after the House passed another leading liberal priority, a major policing bill aimed at combating racial discrimination and excessive use of force in law enforcement. Lawmakers first passed the legislation last summer, in an effort to respond to an outpouring of demands for racial justice after the killings of Black Americans across the country, but then, like now, it faced opposition among Republicans proposing more modest changes. The vote was 220-212, largely along party lines.
House Democrats and Senate Republicans with competing bills were expected to restart talks next week in an attempt to sort out disagreements over Democrats’ proposed restrictions on the use of deadly force and changes to make it easier to prosecute police officers for wrongdoing. But there was little optimism for an immediate breakthrough.
HR 1’s voting provisions were originally drafted by Rep. John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat and civil rights icon who died last year.
If the bill were to become law, states would be required to automatically register eligible voters, hold at least 15 consecutive days of early voting for federal elections and provide drop boxes for absentee ballots like the ones Trump falsely claimed led to fraud. It would make it far easier to vote by mail and far harder to purge voters from the rolls.
The legislation also targets partisan gerrymandering of House seats, requiring states to use independent commissions to draw districts based on apolitical metrics rather than ones that would maximize the influence of one party over another. Both parties gerrymander, but the practice has benefited Republicans more over the past decade. With new districts set to be drawn this fall, Republicans are expected to make even greater gains.
Democrats intend to hold a separate vote in the coming months on legislation to restore the enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down.
The challenge for Democrats is moving any of the bills through a 50-50 Senate, where 10 Republicans would have to vote yes. Under Trump’s leadership, the Republican Party adopted increasingly hard-line tactics on voting and other government overhaul initiatives, rallying around his winner-take-all political style and the outright lies on which he based his attempt to overturn his election loss.
“This monster must be stopped,” Trump said of the Democratic bill last weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference. “It cannot be allowed to pass.”
Democrats have so far rejected changing the Senate rules to allow them to move legislation with 51 votes rather than 60. But advocates of scrapping the filibuster believe the stalled voting bills could eventually prove the most persuasive in winning over moderate senators who are reluctant to support the move.
“Voting rights is preservative of all other rights, and we have to do everything we can to preserve the voices of the people in our democracy,” said Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats whose victory has prompted the state’s new election laws. “I think the issues are urgent enough to leave all options on the table.”

The big political story in New York City is the growing crisis surrounding Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who faced new allegations of sexual harassment over the weekend.
Several Democratic mayoral candidates responded with calls for an independent investigation, and some said Cuomo, a Democrat, should resign if the allegations are substantiated.
And as the Republican field begins to take shape, and many candidates are holding more in-person events, the contest — with the primaries now just four months away — is starting to feel a lot like a normal election, even with the coronavirus still a concern.
Here’s what you need to know about the race:
A Rebuke for Cuomo
Many candidates responded to a New York Times article disclosing that a second woman had accused Cuomo of sexual harassment by calling for an independent investigation, expressing disgust and demanding his resignation if the allegations were further substantiated.
Charlotte Bennett, 25, a former executive assistant and health policy adviser for the governor, said he asked questions about her sex life, including whether she had ever had sex with older men. The charges come after Lindsey Boylan, a former state economic development official, accused Cuomo of giving her an unwanted kiss.
Cuomo called Boylan’s allegations untrue and said he was sorry that some of the things he had said to Bennett “have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation.” The governor is also facing questions over how he handled the state’s nursing homes during the pandemic and over charges of bullying behavior.
Among the candidates, Scott Stringer and Raymond McGuire went the furthest, calling for Cuomo to resign if an independent investigation substantiated the sexual harassment allegations.
Stringer said the governor “must resign” if an investigation “supports these serious and credible allegations.”
Dianne Morales had already called for impeachment proceedings to begin against Cuomo because of allegations of bullying and the way he had handled nursing homes.
“It’s time to address the complete abuses of power that Cuomo has exercised for far too long,” Morales said in a statement.
Kathryn Garcia, Andrew Yang and Shaun Donovan called for independent investigations into the allegations.
Yang said victims of sexual harassment should “feel empowered” to share their stories “without fear or retaliation” and that “Albany must show they take all allegations seriously through action.”
Democratic mayoral hopeful Maya Wiley registered her disgust in a statement on Saturday, saying, “I believe Charlotte Bennett.” She followed up with a statement on Sunday that had at least 20 or so questions about the situation.
Republicans Jockey for Endorsements
Another Republican has entered the mayoral race: Curtis Sliwa, the red-beret-wearing founder of the Guardian Angels, who is running on a law-and-order message.
Sliwa registered with the city Campaign Finance Board recently and was endorsed by Republican leaders on Staten Island. That prompted Fernando Mateo to announce endorsements from the Republican Party in Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens. The two are expected to be top contenders for the Republican nomination, although either would be an extreme long shot in the general election, given that the vast majority of voters in the city are Democrats.
“The reason I’m running for mayor is our city is a ghost town,” Sliwa said in an interview on Newsmax, criticizing rising crime and homelessness.
Sliwa knocked Yang, a former presidential candidate, saying he wants to “give out money that we don’t have” — a reference to universal basic income — and he argued that the Democratic field wants to defund the police. (Most of the Democrats have been reluctant to embrace the defund movement, but they do want to change department policies.)
Sliwa said the city police department had been “neutered” since George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis last year, and he promised to restore police funding and boost morale by visiting every precinct as mayor.
“I’ll pat these cops on the back so hard they’ll have to go for a chiropractic adjustment,” he said.
Mateo, who was born in the Dominican Republic, has highlighted his appeal to Latino voters. The Bronx Republican Party said in a statement that Republicans had made “significant inroads” in minority communities, especially with Latinos.
“With Mateo at the top of the Republican ticket in 2021, we can replicate that success citywide and continue to expand the Republican coalition,” the group said.
Ditching the Video Campaign, if Only for an Afternoon
There are walking tours and outdoor lunches, policy rollouts and church visits.
As the weather begins to warm and the primary election nears, the Democratic mayoral candidates are slowly getting back out onto the campaign trail, appearing increasingly willing to balance the risks of campaigning in a pandemic with the need to engage and excite more voters beyond Zoom.
In the last week, all of the leading mayoral candidates made campaign stops across the city, in some cases several stops in one day. Wiley spent Friday afternoon in the Bronx; Stringer offered his housing plan outdoors; McGuire spent Saturday campaigning in southeast Queens.
Yang, who had to quarantine after testing positive for the coronavirus last month, has from the beginning of his campaign shown more comfort with in-person events, and he was the pacesetter again last week, taking a five-day tour through the five boroughs.
The strategy can pay off. Yang rode the Staten Island Ferry and made positive headlines for helping defend a photographer from an attack.
Eric Adams, Brooklyn's president, and Carlos Menchaca, a Brooklyn city councilman, even held an unusual joint-campaign event in front of the Phoenix Hotel in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood to call for converting empty hotels into affordable housing.
Adams said in an interview that his long days usually start with meditation at 6 a.m., and a recent evening ended with a dinner with South Asian leaders at 9 p.m.
“Every second is utilized,” he said. “From the time I wake up to the time I hit my pillow.”
A Campaign of (Stolen) Ideas
A candidate accusing another candidate of appropriating their campaign’s ideas is a time-honored complaint on the trail. The Democratic primary for mayor is no different. Several candidates for mayor are proponents of some version of universal basic income, one of Yang’s campaign platforms from his run for president. Now, some candidates are accusing Yang of pilfering their campaign ideas.
Adams’ campaign faults Yang’s campaign for stealing ideas to provide pregnant women with doulas and use shuttered storefronts as vaccine-distribution centers.
Stu Loeser, an adviser on McGuire’s campaign, accused the Yang campaign of appropriating their idea to allow small businesses to keep their sales-tax receipts for a year to help recover from the pandemic, and to create a teachers corps to tutor students.
McGuire’s campaign grew so annoyed that they decided to do a bit of internet trolling: Anyone who heads to yangpolicy.com is automatically redirected to McGuire’s campaign website. The official registration for the web address is anonymous, but McGuire’s campaign claimed credit.
“Lots of candidates say they will take on wasteful duplication. We set up yangpolicy.com to actually do something about it,” said Lupe Todd-Medina, a spokeswoman for McGuire.
Yang’s campaign ridiculed the accusations, suggesting that McGuire’s campaign and others have used ideas they first proposed.
“You know what’s not a new idea? Last-place candidate going after first-place candidate to get attention,” said Alyssa Cass, Yang’s communications director.
As for Adams’ idea about doulas, Cass said Yang agreed with Adams and had spoken with others about the idea.
“Eric has had 15-plus years as an elected official and never gotten it done,” Cass said. “We’ll make it a Year 1 priority.”
Who Will Save Broadway?
One central issue in the race is how to bring back Broadway and the city’s struggling cultural institutions.
Garcia, the former sanitation commissioner, last week released her plan, “Reopen to Stay Open,” which calls for removing red tape for small businesses and working with streaming services to broadcast Broadway shows.
Garcia said she will be the city’s cheerleader, visiting museums and Broadway shows to get New Yorkers excited about returning to them. She held a recent Broadway-themed fundraiser with Will Roland, an actor from the musical “Dear Evan Hansen.”
Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, has talked about rebuilding the arts and proposed spending $1 billion on a recovery plan for artists and culture workers as part of her “New Deal New York” proposal.
Wiley also said she wants to be a cheerleader for the city and would not run away from the job, referring to de Blasio’s penchant for spending time outside the city during a failed presidential run in 2019.
“You don’t have to worry about me going to Iowa,” Wiley said at a candidate forum. “I’d much rather be on Broadway celebrating its survival.”
