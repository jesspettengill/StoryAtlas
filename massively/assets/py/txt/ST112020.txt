Full text: Minneapolis police officers will face restrictions on entering a person's home unannounced under a new policy banning most "no-knock" search warrants, the latest attempt by city leaders to reform police practices in the wake of George Floyd's killing.
The change would, for the first time, establish clear expectations for MPD officers before crossing the threshold of a home. Surprise police raids have resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians and most recently came under harsh criticism after police in Louisville, Ky., fatally shot Breonna Taylor in her home last March.
Mayor Jacob Frey called the move "overdue."
"This is really about proactive policymaking, and we can't prevent every tragedy, but we can limit the likelihood of tragedies occurring and then set a clear, objective standard for both the police and the community," he said in an interview late last week.
Starting Monday, officers must identify themselves as "police" and announce their purpose as "search warrant" before entering any domicile -- regardless of whether a judge signed off on an "unannounced" or "no-knock" entry. Once inside, officers are instructed to periodically repeat those announcements in case occupants didn't hear them. The same rules, which mirror those already in place across the river in St. Paul, also apply for arrest warrants.
The practice, most often used by SWAT officers, should help maintain the element of surprise and preservation of evidence while eliminating confusion about who's entering the building, said police spokesman John Elder.
Under new guidelines, no-knock warrants would be acceptable only in high-risk circumstances such as a hostage situation, when "giving an announcement would create an imminent threat of physical harm to victims, officers or the public."
If investigators want an exception to search a residence without warning, they will need express permission from the chief or a designee.
MPD executed an average 139 no-knock warrants a year.
"Even amid the most difficult circumstances, our men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department continue to carry out their duties with the highest level of excellence," Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a statement. "By implementing this new policy, we're committing ourselves to continued improvement and ensuring best practices are cemented in policy within this department."
The policy change comes six months to the day after Floyd's death at a south Minneapolis street corner, which sparked a wave of protests and national reckoning on racial justice. Floyd died May 25 after since-fired officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck, ignoring his pleas for help until he fell unconscious and later died.
Since then, the department has banned the use of chokeholds and neck restraints, strengthened requirements to intervene in excessive-force cases, limited the number of people who can authorize the use of crowd-control weapons and allowed for wider body-camera reviews, under an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.
Frey's office also made other changes, such as requiring officers to document attempts to de-escalate situations and restricting access to body camera footage before officers file their reports.
The latest revision puts Minneapolis more in line with cities including Louisville; Houston; Memphis; Indianapolis and Aurora, Colo., as well as the states of Oregon, Florida and Virginia.
The American Civil Liberties Union urged law enforcement agencies to ban no-knock warrants following the death of 26-year-old Taylor, who was shot eight times by police on March 13 after three narcotics officers used a no-knock warrant to bust down the door of her apartment during a late-night drug investigation.
Her boyfriend mistook the raid for a home invasion and fired back, striking a detective. Police were looking for Taylor's ex, who was already in custody. No drugs were found.
That case exemplifies why no-knock warrants are so dangerous, said Hennepin County Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty.
"If you're in your home and you have no idea who's actually breaking into your house, you are going to react -- and you might react the way Breonna Taylor's partner did with a gun," she said. "It's not safe for officers or residents."
However, Moriarty lauded MPD's new policy as a "terrific step forward" in reducing the number of such encounters.
A 2014 ACLU report on police militarization detailed several botched SWAT team raids that killed innocent people as no-knock warrants were served, including one that year in Atlanta where an errant flashbang grenade caused a toddler to be put into a medically induced coma.
In Minneapolis' most high-profile case, a flashbang grenade thrown by SWAT members during a 1989 raid inside a north Minneapolis apartment started a fire, killing an older Black couple.
Police officials apologized, calling Lloyd Smalley, 71, and Lillian Weiss, 65, accidental victims of the war on drugs.
The officers were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.
Then, in 2007, MPD officers executing a no-knock search on the wrong house exchanged gunfire with Vang Khang, who thought they were burglars. His wife and six children, ages 3 to 15, were in the house. Police blamed the mix-up on bad intel from an informant.

Full text: You might not know the name Andrs Guzm¡n, but you may have seen his work. The Minneapolis artist's image of George Floyd, one of the first rendered and posted on social media, has been shared around the world.
We talked with the Peru-born Guzm¡n about living in Minnesota, the role of art in racial equality issues and his hopes for creating "new meanings and memories" around Thanksgiving.
Q: Tell us a little about yourself. Where were you born? Where did you grow up?
A: I work in illustration and graphic arts. I was born in Lima, Peru. I moved to the USA when I was 6 with my family and lived around Denver, Colorado, most of my youth.
Q: How did you end up in the Twin Cities?
A: I moved to the Twin Cities in 2006 for school. I went to Minneapolis College of Art and Design for a few years. I graduated in 2009
Q: Why did you decide to hang around in a place where the winters scare off many newcomers?
A: I lived and worked in Minneapolis after graduating. I saw many people I studied with leave for bigger cities, but I liked the communal size of Minneapolis. It's very green and lush here and easy to bike around. Living around Denver was good, but it's super dry there. Minnesota winter is challenging, but has been a great teacher!
Q: Do you think of yourself as a visual guy or a word guy? Do the two overlap? Intersect?
A: Image and text can overlap, but color and line is my alphabet of choice. People in the USA grow up writing hundreds of essays in school but not as much painting, dancing, building, singing, cooking.
I'm happy that yoga and meditation are entering public schools these days. Seems much needed. There are vast stories and lessons to be learned in tone, color, vibration, movement, rhythm, flavor.
Q: What media do you prefer to work in?
A: My favorite medium to create imagery is India ink, acrylic paint, digital/tablet.
Q: What do you consider your most powerful piece of art?
A: It is difficult to know the power an image has. People have shown me old drawings of mine they kept from childhood days. That has been powerful to me. My drawing of George Floyd was powerful in a different, more public way.
Q: You made a big impact on social media with your image of Floyd. Why did you decide to share that image?
A: I created the image of George Floyd the morning after his death while I was still in bed. I read about what happened so early on that there was little information and no immediate image of George. I wanted to at least help broadcast the incident since it happened in my neighborhood.
Sadly, this isn't the first senseless violent crime local police have committed, so I made the image available for people to download and use as needed. I drew it real quick, in 10 to 15 minutes, but had no idea the ripple effect this particular incident would have on the world. I had not even seen the video [of his arrest] yet.
Q: Was creating the image of Floyd the first time you delved into racial equality issues?
A: As an image-maker, racial issues faced me early in life. I would get sent to the principal's office for drawing or wearing imagery the school staff believed to be gang-related or problematic. At 11 years old, my expression is already policed and viewed as a potential threat.
As an immigrant kid in the '90s, I drew heavy influence from lowrider culture, prison art and graffiti. I collected lowrider T-shirts and stickers. I would beg my mother to buy me the latest issue of Lowrider Arte Magazine at the grocery store so I could study the diverse art submissions -- smoothly blended sparkles and reflections, graphite drawings of intricate Aztec calendars.
I didn't have to consciously depict racial issues in art because my very existence was a racial issue.
Q: How did you feel about being asked to draw the bird for the annual Oh, You Turkey coloring contest?
A: I was very happy to draw this year's bird. I am eager to see different people's remixed versions of it.
Regardless of the problematic historic origins of this national holiday, we can create new meanings and memories around it for the future. This future also doesn't have to look like a Norman Rockwell painting. Maybe a Pablo Amaringo painting?

Police reform bogs down in details: Critics see a patchwork of programs; officials see a plan.

Full text: The outcry that followed George Floyd's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer surpassed anything Michelle Gross had seen in 30 years of pushing for police reform.
But six months later, the tragic momentum for change in that moment, she said, has fizzled into frustration.
"It's been a revelation to me, a disappointing revelation, to see how unwilling the mayor and the council have been to be real leaders in this," said Gross, of Communities United Against Police Brutality.
The city's elected leaders say they remain committed to changing the way the city runs its 150-year-old police department and approaches public safety -- a task that has proved difficult as residents make competing demands during an especially violent year. It has also taxed the city's staff and raised fresh questions about Minneapolis' power structure.
"If people are encouraging us to move faster, I agree," Mayor Jacob Frey said. While the city has made some policy changes -- including those required by a court order -- others need intense legal reviews and changes at other levels of government, he said.
Some on City Council are urging people to keep the faith and to give them time to sort out the 2021 budget in December. Among other things, Frey's budget proposal calls for boosting funding for the Office of Violence Prevention, purchasing an early warning system to flag officers who are struggling and adding workers to the 311 department who can focus on processing theft reports.
Council members will get to pitch their own proposals next week. Some are exploring a plan to have specially trained workers respond to mental health calls or increase opportunities for civilian oversight. Some hope to further boost efforts to mediate conflicts in the community before they escalate into gunfire.
The overarching goal is to take a "public health approach to public safety," Council Member Phillipe Cunningham has said repeatedly.
Where critics see a patchwork of pilot programs and research projects, some elected leaders see a wider plan beginning to take shape that focuses on reforming the police department, increasing violence prevention and exploring alternatives to policing.
"I think the pieces that different council members are working on fit together in a much more coherent narrative than it might look if you look at them all separately," Council Member Steve Fletcher said.
What comes next?
Many of the activists who imagine a future without police will be watching closely as the council works through budget negotiations amid a financial crunch brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.
Black Visions and its sister organization, Reclaim the Block, want council members to fulfill a pledge nine of them made this summer to "begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department." Some were troubled when the council recently approved funding to bring in extra officers amid a shortage.
"I would say that after the murder of George Floyd this summer and after the uprising, the mayor and the council both had an opportunity and, I think, a mandate, to really, fundamentally [rethink] how we keep each other safe in this city," said Lex Horan, an organizer with Reclaim the Block. "So far, we aren't satisfied with either the mayor or the council."
Some Black leaders say the campaign aimed at ending the police department has been detrimental to the city, sending a dangerous signal to criminals that police are not protecting property and residents. Former Council Member Don Samuels, who is suing the city over its police staffing levels, said he thought the pledge to end the department was "naive," especially on the heels of rioting. People living in his North Side neighborhood felt ignored at the very time they feared for their safety.
"We all make big mistakes, right. We're all learning," Samuels said, "but the reluctance to pivot in the light of conflicting realities is just mind-boggling."
Mixed views on funding
Only 40% of Minneapolis residents favored reducing the size of the police force, according a Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll conducted in August. Among Black residents in the city, opposition to cutting police officers reached 50%.
Steven Belton, president and CEO of the Urban League Twin Cities said the council promised to listen deeply to the community and keep people safe. "We seem to have failed spectacularly in both," he said.
Some council members are trying to impose their views on residents, he said, noting the mayor seems more willing to listen.
"The real issue is: Is he going to be allowed to lead, along with the police chief?" Belton said, adding: "We need radical reimagining of the police department. That is not the same as defunding the police department or stopping policing."
Indeed, some people and council members want to see Frey do more to change policing.
"The truth is, if we had more support from the mayor to invest in these community-based strategies, in mental health response, we would be much farther along," City Council President Lisa Bender said. "We would have been farther along before George Floyd was killed."
Weeks after Floyd's death, Bender and four of her colleagues pushed a proposal that would have allowed them to replace the police department with a community safety department, and shifted some power over police from the mayor to the council.
With that delayed -- and eventually rejected -- by the volunteer Charter Commission, some council members have turned to a mechanism called a staff direction. That allows them to instruct city employees to prioritize certain work, such as providing recommendations for community engagement or researching ways to form a truth and reconciliation commission.
The Charter Commission has begun researching whether Minneapolis should consider switching to a system like the one in St. Paul, where the mayor has more control.
Frey hasn't taken a public position on whether the city should make that change, though he did acknowledge that the line marking who has authority over the police department at times gets blurred."
The mayor said his work on the police department is not over. He's talking to the union about a policy to ban no-knock warrants, except in extreme circumstances, like an active hostage situation.
He's open to discussions about redirecting nonviolent 911 calls or finessing responses to mental health crises -- but says those changes require more analysis and planning.
"These are complex questions," he said. "They are going to be answered, and we are moving forward. It does take time, though."

STEPS SO FAR
Minneapolis leaders have pledged a variety of changes in policing and public safety. Here's where they stand.
Court-ordered changes: The city banned chokeholds, strengthened requirements to intervene in excessive force cases, limited the number of people who can authorize the use of crowd-control weapons and allowed for wider body-camera reviews, under an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.
Police Federation negotiations: Chief Medaria Arradondo withdrew from union negotiations, but others in the city continue to participate.
Mental health support: Police can receive 10 counseling sessions under a pilot program launching in 2021. Some council members are exploring the idea of creating civilian mental health response teams next year.
Early warning system: The mayor's budget proposal calls for purchasing a system to flag officers' behavior for early intervention, but the funding still needs council approval.
Emergency calls: Elected officials endorsed the idea of having the city's 311 line process more theft reports, but they need additional staff to begin that work. The city is also researching whether civilians could handle some other 911 calls.
Violence prevention: Minneapolis teams that connect people with social services and resolve conflicts are funded through 2020. City staff have also been asked to provide recommendations for increasing efforts on the North Side.
Racial healing: Staff is researching ways to create a truth and reconciliation commission, with recommendations due in January.

BUYERS 'HOLD ALL THE MARBLES' DOWNTOWN: AGENTS SAY THAT, FOR NOW AT LEAST, SUPPLIES OF AVAILABLE URBAN CONDOS AND TOWNHOMES EXCEED DEMAND

Author: Buchta, Jim

Full text: Buyers have outnumbered sellers in much of the Twin Cities this year with a pair of notable outliers: downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul, where there are now more condos and townhouses for sale than buyers.
In a metro market with a dearth of homes for sale, downtown Minneapolis has seen a 5% increase in condo and townhouse listings during the first 10 months of the year as closed sales have dropped 34%, according to new data from the Minneapolis Area Realtors (MAR).
Agents say that after years of premarket sales and bidding wars, downtown has become, at least for now, a buyer's market.
"It's their ballgame," said Isaac Kuehn, a sales agent based in the North Loop. "Sellers used to hold all the marbles."
Much of the sudden shift is attributed to a downtown double-whammy: COVID-19, which shuttered the offices, restaurants and other attractions that lured buyers, and rising crime, which has forced many downtown dwellers to reconsider their options.
"We feel very fortunate that we sold when we did and we got a fair price," said Lindsay Santala, who with her husband sold a two-bedroom condo a block off Washington Avenue this summer.
Four years ago, before the couple had kids, they bought the
1,800 square-foot condo because they both worked downtown and loved being within walking distance to their offices, sporting events and other attractions.
After their second child, they converted a den into a nursery and regularly used their building's amenities, including the community room and pool.
When the kids started walking and COVID shuttered their offices and so many of the places they liked visiting, they decided to swap their condo for a house with a yard, more space for the kids and places to work remotely.
They listed it in early March, just before the COVID stay-at-home orders were issued and got an offer about a week before George Floyd was killed.
The couple shopped for a house in south Minneapolis and the suburbs, but weren't able to find one before their closing, so they moved in with Santala's mother.
With crime on the rise, they're now focused solely on the suburbs. "If we didn't have kids we probably would have stayed," she said.
Though this shift has sellers on edge, real estate agents say the situation is unlikely to be a repeat of the housing crash during the Great Recession.
Demographics favor multifamily living and there's a shortage of new moderately priced condos in the development pipeline.
"I sense most residents downtown are optimistic, but realistic in that things won't bounce back overnight," said Cynthia Froid, a sales agent with an office in the Mill District.
Last year Froid and others often sold condos before they hit the market. On average, it's taking 47 days to sell a listing in downtown Minneapolis.
Agents say demand varies by area and price range, and with fewer corporate relocations and not as many suburban retirees coming downtown, seven-figure sales are often difficult to pull off.
"Buyers in this price category generally have the luxury of pressing the pause button," said Froid.
Another reason a Great Recession rerun isn't anticipated, agents say, is because there are only two condo projects in the pipeline.
Both are relatively small and unaffordable to most buyers, and both buildings are a couple of years from completion.
That includes the Eleven on the River, where the least expensive units are priced at just under $1 million, and less than three dozen units at the Residences at the Four Seasons atop the RBC Gateway tower.
For now, sellers are adjusting their expectations. The price per square foot for condos and townhouses in downtown so far this year was $308, down 4% compared with last year, according to a rolling 12-month average of all sales.
And price reductions are becoming more common.
"Someone is going to get a deal from us," said DeBora Bernick, who is among a large contingent of downtown condo owners who split their time between multiple homes, including "urban cabins" they bought so they could take part in sporting events, theater or other urban activities.
Bernick, who spends summers in Duluth and winters in La Quinta, Calif., bought a two-bedroom condo on the 23rd floor of a downtown high-rise two years ago.
She took a year to complete a top-to-bottom renovation, but ended up visiting far less than she expected, so late last year she listed the 1,200 square-foot condo for $550,000.
"It's not that we don't love it," she said. "We're not spending time there and I don't see us spending time there anytime soon."
She acknowledges that she was initially trying to recoup her renovation costs and so it was priced higher than other similar floor plans in the buildings.
They've had several showings, but no offers, so she's discounted the price nearly $80,000.
"I felt like we bought it at a good price so I could sell it for what I had into it," she said. "But I'm not sure given what's happening downtown."
Her agent, Pauline Olsen, said that during the spring COVID shutdown and George Floyd riots buyers were scarce.
"I think there was a huge fear of downtown Minneapolis mostly because of what people were seeing on TV," she said.
"There was maybe a month where people were really scared, but they were scared everywhere."
Buyers seem less wary today, she said, and they're clearly motivated by price reductions.
She recently worked with a couple who relocated to the Twin Cities from Denver. After looking at a handful of units, they quickly bought a two-bedroom condo at Portland Tower the day after an $80,000 price cut.
Colleen LaBeau, who is marketing that project, said the last three available units at Portland Tower have since sold and fewer than a dozen units are available at the Legacy, the last big condo project to be completed downtown.
When the building was first built, she expected it to not sell out until 2022.
"When COVID first hit, for three weeks we didn't have a call," she said. "It's slowed down around the election, but we're starting to get showings again."
Despite an air of uncertainty about downtown Minneapolis, Dana and Pat Chabot are making a long-term investment in the city.
This month, they paid $10,000 less than the asking price for an upscale condo near the Mississippi River -- the day it hit the market.
"Even if the market isn't as hot as it used to be and we might have overpaid a little bit, it still feels like a risk worth taking," said Dana Chabot.
For Chabot, the decision to move to downtown Minneapolis dovetailed with plans to retire to the city where he was born and still has friends.
For the past several decades the couple has lived in Madison, Wis. They had just returned home after a recent house shopping in Minneapolis when their agent notified them about a condo that had just come available.
They headed back to Minneapolis, did a tour and immediately made an offer.
Chabot, an accountant, said civil unrest and rising crime didn't make him question their decision.
Friends who live in his new neighborhood say they haven't felt threatened or unsafe, and he's accustomed to seeing boarded-up storefronts in Madison, which is dealing with some of the same racial equity and public safety issues as Minneapolis.
"There's an excitement about coming to a place that's wrestling with a long-standing problem that a lot of towns and cities haven't had to confront yet. We would like to find a way to be part of a solution," he said.
"This is an opportunity for Minneapolis to make some serious progress and I'd like to be part of it."

Full text: A divorce settlement that would have given most of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's assets to his wife was rejected by a judge who cited the possibility of fraud.
Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce on May 31, days after her husband was charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, leading some veteran divorce attorneys to speculate about whether it was a divorce of convenience to protect their assets against lawsuits in civil court.
Washington County District Judge Juanita Freeman wrote in her October ruling that judges can deny an uncontested agreement reached between a couple, such as with the Chauvins, if "the transfer features 'badges of fraud.' "
"The Court has a duty to ensure that marriage dissolution agreements are fair and equitable," Freeman wrote. "One badge of fraud is a party's transfer of 'substantially all' of his or her assets."
Freeman did not accuse them of fraud or discuss motives.
Calling the judge's ruling "rare," local divorce attorneys said it adds to suspicions that Derek and Kellie Chauvin are trying to protect their assets.
"This is just speculation, but it's possible that the [agreement] was intentionally drafted to get assets out of Chauvin's name in anticipation of a civil judgment against him from the estate of George Floyd," said divorce attorney Marc Beyer. "That may be what the court is getting at when it references 'badges of fraud.' "
Kellie Chauvin's attorney, Amanda Mason-Sekula, did not return a message seeking comment.
Derek Chauvin has no attorney in the divorce. His attorney in the criminal case, Eric Nelson, did not return a message seeking comment.
Attorneys for Floyd's family filed a federal lawsuit in July against the city of Minneapolis, Chauvin and three of his former colleagues who assisted in Floyd's May 25 arrest: J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao.
The suit did not specify compensation, but family attorney Benjamin Crump said they would seek "a precedent that makes it financially prohibitive for police to wrongfully kill marginalized people."
All four officers were fired and charged in the case. Their trial is scheduled for March 8.
Chauvin is accused of planting his knee on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes, during which Floyd lost consciousness and later died.
The terms of Derek and Kellie Chauvin's agreement are not known because they were heavily redacted in a document filed Sept. 30.
However, Freeman wrote that under the agreement, Kellie Chauvin would have received all the equity in their two homes, all the money in their bank and investment accounts and all the money from Derek Chauvin's pension and retirement accounts.
Funds from two of Derek Chauvin's accounts that were earned before the couple's 2010 marriage would have been exempt. Chauvin was a Minneapolis officer from 2001 until his firing this year.
It's unknown if the monetary amounts were listed in the agreement due to the heavy redaction. Chauvin has not begun drawing his pension, so that amount is not yet public information.
Unrelated court documents and property records offer a peek into their assets.
Several tax-related felony charges filed in Washington County this summer against the couple allege that they failed to claim $464,433 in joint income dating back to 2014.
Derek Chauvin earned $52,000 to $72,000 annually between 2014 and 2019 as an officer. He also earned nearly $96,000 working security at businesses while off duty.
Property records show that they purchased an Oakdale house in 2017 for $260,000. It sold in August for $279,000.
They bought a Florida townhouse in 2011 for $210,900; its market value this year was $249,224.
Divorces of convenience aren't unheard of, attorneys said. They're sometimes filed to protect assets when someone enters assisted living or is dealing with health problems that could result in exorbitant bills.
Judges are compelled by law to ensure that divorces are equitable, but state law also encourages settlement agreements without additional court involvement.
"It's unusual that a judge would reject a stipulated agreement," said divorce attorney Victoria Brenner. "They receive them happily, knowing that they've avoided any more administration of this case and a trial, which is really time-consuming."
It could be argued that Kellie Chauvin, an unemployed real estate agent, needs more of the assets as her husband faces potential prison time, said Brenner, who represented a woman in a similar situation. However, Brenner said, "Practically speaking, [Derek Chauvin] will need assets."
The Chauvins could submit a revised agreement. If no revised agreement is reached and approved, the case could be tried in court.
Theoretically, Freeman could also divide the assets as she deems fit and is empowered to do through state law.
"It is not often that parties' personal divorce agreements implicate policy interests of the state … clearly Judge Freeman thinks they do here," said divorce attorney Jack De Walt. "In that sense, Judge Freeman should be commended."
The case has been set for a pretrial hearing on March 26 and for trial on April 26.

Walz warns time is running out on policing reforms: Governor says the changes made in July should be the starting point for new policy.

Full text: Gov. Tim Walz called on state legislators Wednesday to pass new policing and criminal justice overhauls next year, warning that time is running out for meaningful change.
Speaking to a virtual audience of criminal justice scholars, activists and elected officials, Walz said a package of sweeping new measures that he signed into law in July in response to George Floyd's death, which included bans on chokeholds and warrior-style training, did not go far enough to address long-standing racial disparities and curb police misconduct in Minnesota.
"Imagine us being pleased that in the summer of 2020, after George Floyd was choked to death on the street, that we're patting ourselves on the back because we banned chokeholds," Walz said in remarks delivered during the Minnesota Justice Research Center's virtual Re-Imagining Justice Conference. "That ought to show you the amount of work that needs to be done."
The changes Walz signed into law in July also included a new requirement for officers to intervene in cases of misconduct, and new data collection and oversight measures. But on Wednesday, the governor said he expected the new Legislature, when it reconvenes for its next regular session in January, to "come right back to where we were" in trying to advance new criminal justice policy proposals.
One priority telegraphed by the governor on Wednesday included juvenile justice proposals such as raising the age of delinquency in Minnesota to above 14 and "ending the medieval, Byzantine practice of shackling juveniles and adding to a trauma that's already there" as specific priorities for his office next year.
"Incarceration is a failure of the system," Walz said. "When we get to that point, we have failed at every step along the way and most of the outcomes after incarceration do not end well."
The center's annual conference is its first without founder Tom Johnson, the former Hennepin County Attorney who died in June after a six-year battle with advanced prostate cancer.
Panelists also confronted the ongoing debate over the future of policing in Minnesota. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey critiqued the "binary mind-set" of either abolishing police or taking no action. Still, proponents for police reform "rightly point out that we have turned to police to handle issues in society that nobody wants to do," Frey said.
Jamael Lundy, a policy aide for state Rep. Carlos Mariani, a St. Paul Democrat who has been chairman of the House's public safety committee since 2019, called for improving state regulation of law enforcement and allowing for more civilian oversight.
Of calls to "abolish" police, Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said he did not see that as a possibility. Police departments do need to change to better reflect the communities they serve, Harrington said, but so does a system where "anything the government doesn't know what to do with, they've given it to the police department."
"A lot of the social conditions where we have crime are the result of the governance system that we are operating in and the police are simply the group that works 24/7 and makes house calls to respond to those spots that are troubling to the community," Harrington said.
Chas Anderson, a former top House Republican staffer who now lobbies for the national Justice Action Network on public safety policy in Minnesota, said Walz's spotlighting of the issue makes the debate "a little more friendly vs. a governor who is not interested in reform."
Yet Anderson conceded that another round of divided government could pose a challenge for passing new criminal justice proposals in 2021. The policy package Walz signed into law this summer involved some 16 offers traded between legislative leaders before both chambers signed off.
"The areas we can make progress in, we either make it or we face the fact that it's probably never going to happen," Walz said. "I truly believe it."

2017 Chauvin arrest video sought for trial: Prosecutors say footage with teen shows pattern of unreasonable force.

Full text: Prosecutors in the upcoming murder trial of Derek Chauvin want to show jurors video of a 2017 arrest in which they say the former Minneapolis police officer jammed his knee into the back of a 14-year-old boy for several minutes while ignoring his pleas that he couldn't breathe.
In a memorandum filed late Monday in Hennepin County District court, assistant state Attorney General Matthew Frank said the body camera footage showed that "when faced with a suspect who does not immediately comply with his demands, Chauvin intentionally uses a level of unreasonable force to accomplish subdual and restraint," countering a defense claim that Chauvin used reasonable force on George Floyd three years later.
In his response, Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, argued that the force used in incidents cited was in keeping with the department's then-policy on dealing with uncooperative suspects.
"The similarities between the State's proffered acts, which were noncriminal incidents of Mr. Chauvin acting in his duties as a Minneapolis Police officer, and the charged offenses are merely: They involved Mr. Chauvin effecting, or assisting in, the arrest of a suspect; all involved resistance from or a struggle with a suspect; some involved Mr. Chauvin using his body weight to control an arrestee; some involved a neck restraint," Nelson wrote. "This is simply insufficient to show a marked similarity between the proffered incidents and the charged offenses."
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill has yet to rule on Monday's memorandum or other motions citing other alleged bad acts, known as Spreigl evidence, against Chauvin and his three co-defendants: Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng.
The trial is set to start on March 8.
The latest prosecution memorandum is a follow-up to an earlier filing that mentions the incident with the boy, which was based on written reports filed by Chauvin and other officers at the scene. But, Frank argues, body camera video of the encounter tells a different story.
In their earlier filings, prosecutors sought to introduce evidence from seven prior incidents involving Chauvin to show a pattern of excessive force to restrain suspects long before he encountered Floyd. They also cited one prior episode involving Kueng -- a rookie at the time of Floyd's death -- and nine involving Thao.
In June, the department banned the use of chokeholds and neck restraints, acting at the behest of state authorities.
Chauvin, a 19-year department veteran, and his co-defendants were all fired the day after Floyd's death in May. Chauvin is facing second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter charges, while the other three former officers stand charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
State and federal authorities have launched parallel investigations of the incident and of the city's beleaguered police force.
Footage from the incident in question shows Chauvin and another officer responding to a domestic assault Sept. 4, 2017, in which a mother said she was assaulted by her son and daughter, who were both minors.
Shortly after arriving, the officers found the son lying on the floor in the back of the house, on his phone, and ordered him to get up because he was under arrest.
When he refused, Chauvin grabbed him and, without saying anything, struck the teen in the head with his flashlight and then grabbed him by the throat, before hitting him again with the flashlight -- all of which occurred less than a minute after the officers first encountered the boy, prosecutors said.
According to prosecutors, the video then showed Chauvin applying a neck restraint to the boy, who briefly went unconscious, and then placing him in a prone position with a knee in his back for about 17 minutes until paramedics arrived.
Chauvin held the position even after the child told him that he was in pain and couldn't breathe, and after the mother tried to intervene, prosecutors said.
At one point, the boy started bleeding from his ear -- from getting hit with the flashlight, he later told paramedics -- and the boy asked to be put on his back, because his neck really hurt.
He then began crying and again asked to be flipped over, prompting Chauvin to ask if the boy would be "flopping around at all."
"No," the boy responded.
"Better not," Chauvin said, keeping his knee on the child's back.
According to prosecutors, Chauvin's report from the incident suggested that the boy "then displayed active resistance to efforts to take him into custody" by "flailing his arms around." He went on to write that the boy, whom he described as "approximately 6'2" and at least 240 pounds," would "escalate his efforts to not be arrested," and because of the boy's large size, Chauvin "deliver[ed] a few strikes to [the juvenile male] to impact his shoulders and hopefully allow control to be obtained."
But prosecutors say this account is contradicted by the body camera video.
"As was true with the conduct with George Floyd, Chauvin rapidly escalated his use of force for a relatively minor offense. Just like with Floyd, Chauvin used an unreasonable amount of force without regard for the need for that level of force or the victim's well-being," Frank wrote in the filing. "Just like with Floyd, when the child was slow to comply with Chauvin and Walls' instructions, Chauvin grabbed the child by the throat, forced him to the ground in the prone position, and placed his knee on the child's neck with so much force that the child began to cry out in pain and tell Chauvin he could not breathe. And just like with Floyd, Chauvin ignored those pleas and refused to provide medical assistance."
It's unclear whether a complaint was filed or an Internal Affairs investigation was launched stemming from the incident, but Chauvin's personnel file shows no discipline during that time frame.
Earlier this month, Cahill ruled that the four former officers would be tried together in Hennepin County, rejecting a defense change of venue motion arguing that the officers couldn't receive a fair trial in the county.
Attorneys for the defendants had argued for individual trials, but Cahill wrote in his ruling that conducting four separate monthslong trials "is likely to compound and prolong the trauma to the community and the State."
Defense attorneys had argued that the vast amount of media coverage Floyd's killing has attracted has tainted the local jury pool.
They also asserted that Hennepin County is unsafe after protesters allegedly assaulted a lawyer and defendant following a downtown court hearing in September, and after a protester was allegedly found with a gun and knives in the Hennepin County courthouse following an October hearing.
Cahill wrote that smaller courthouses would not improve safety, and that "no corner of the state of Minnesota has been shielded" from coverage of Floyd's death.
Amid a flurry of motions filed this week, prosecutors also asked Cahill to reconsider his order allowing the upcoming trial to be recorded and streamed.
The prosecution also argued against the introduction of evidence from a May 6, 2019, arrest during which Floyd was said to have swallowed some drugs in his possession.

Full text: Prosecutors in the case against the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd have asked the presiding judge to reconsider his order allowing their upcoming trial to be recorded and livestreamed.
In a two-page motion filed Monday, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank asked Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill to revisit his Nov. 4 order allowing audio and video coverage of trial scheduled for March. The state objected to such coverage in July, but did not provide an explanation.
Citing immense global interest in the case, limited courthouse space and restricted public movements because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cahill wrote in the historic order that the "only way to vindicate the defendants' constitutional right to a public trial and the media's and public's constitutional rights of access to criminal trials is to allow audio and video coverage of the trial."
The live broadcast of a high-profile trial in a Minnesota state court is without precedent and the decision was greeted with enthusiasm by the news media and First Amendment lawyers who say it is both welcome and overdue. Cameras are rarely allowed, even though many other states have permitted them for decades. Defense attorneys for Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao filed a joint motion in June requesting camera access at all pretrial hearings and at the trial or trials.

'Defund' costly for Dems at polls?: Centrists contend slogan cost the party House seats in Minnesota, nationally.

Full text: Centrist Democrats struggling to understand their losses in state and federal elections that were expected to be part of a "blue wave" are putting some of the blame on the "defund the police" movement that began in Minneapolis.
Even as Joe Biden won the White House, Democrats in swing districts across the country were hammered with attacks tethering them to calls within the Minneapolis City Council to "begin the process of ending" the Minneapolis Police Department following the killing of George Floyd.
President Donald Trump and Republican candidates nationwide immediately seized on the mantra of "defund the police," juxtaposing the imagery of fewer cops patrolling the streets with burning buildings during civil unrest following Floyd's death.
South Carolina U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, the Democratic House majority whip, compared the defund slogan to the "burn, baby, burn" chants of the 1960s that helped propel Richard Nixon to the White House. On election night, Republicans chipped away at Democratic majorities in both the U.S. House and the Minnesota House.
Sen. Jeff Hayden, DFL-Minneapolis, noted that Biden won in a half-dozen state Senate districts that DFL candidates lost. He thinks the ill-formed rollout of the council's proposal to reshape policing was part of the reason. Senate Republicans maintain a one-vote majority in the chamber.
"Everybody's words and the way they message, that matters," said Hayden, who lost a primary race in August to Democratic Socialist opponent Omar Fateh. "If we're going win legislative races, we're going to have to figure out how to appeal to some of these folks, because clearly they switched their ballot from the top of the ticket to the bottom."
Progressive leaders in Congress and Minneapolis point to a historic surge in turnout in large cities across the nation, part of the winning coalition that delivered key states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania to Biden. They see themselves as an easy scapegoat for Democrats trying to explain away critical losses, particularly in an election that was as much about Trump as any one issue.
"The number of daily voter registrations in Minnesota quadrupled in the month following George Floyd's murder. Voter turnout surged, not just in Hennepin County, but across the state. And President-elect Biden outperformed Secretary [Hillary] Clinton by almost 8 points," said U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar. "So while some folks want to point to progressive policies as the reasons Democrats underperformed, it's just not true. Our values don't turn voters off -- they turn voters out."
Omar backed the move to "dismantle" the department after a group of nine City Council members stood on a stage in Powderhorn Park and took the pledge. Reading off a prepared statement, they said they didn't have all the answers about "what a police-free future looks like, but our community does."
At the time, there was little clarity for voters about what defunding or dismantling the police would look like.
In Minneapolis many people turned to individual council members for help interpreting the pledge. Some used the word "abolish." Others preferred "defund." Others focused on boosting violence prevention efforts and access to social services.
Republicans seized on "defund" and "abolish," a lifeline for the party at a time when Trump's approval ratings were dipping and the administration was losing the messaging battle on handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while high voter turnout helped Democratic candidates in liberal urban districts, Clyburn and others blame the "defund" movement for losses in suburban swing districts that were more open to the GOP's message on crime and lawlessness.
Glen Bolger, a partner in the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, said a majority across the country opposes the message of defunding the police.
"It's just one of those things where, every time the Democrats who supported it talked about it and touted it, as a Republican campaign strategist, I was like, 'Yes, please keep talking about this,' " Bolger said. "In areas where Republicans did better than expected, that certainly was a factor."
For the months of August and September, it was the main Republican attack against Democratic candidates in battleground races for the state Senate. Bemidji mayor and DFL Senate candidate Rita Albrecht said she faced a flood of mailers, television and radio ads attacking her as the "defund the police" candidate, despite consistently supporting police budgets.
"For about two months it was the only conversation we were having," said Matt Little, DFL-Lakeville, who represents a suburban district that was another top target for Senate Republicans. Both candidates lost.
In her own campaign post-mortem, DFLer Bonnie Westlin said there were a number of reasons they lost a suburban Senate seat by about 900 votes. They didn't door knock for public health reasons, and some people split their votes between parties, while others didn't vote all the way down the ballot. But defund the police attacks were "ubiquitous and pernicious" in her race, and she wished Democrats had crafted a response.
"I think globally there was a decision to try to not give it more oxygen by not buying into that particular frame, but I don't think it was an effective pivot from that line of attack," said Westlin, who is running again in 2022. "We have to figure out, if something like this comes up like this again, what is our effective pivot."
Minneapolis Council Member Linea Palmisano didn't take the pledge in Powderhorn Park but did attend the event to watch. Palmisano said some in political circles had told her privately that if Democrats lost this year, "the blame will be laid in Minneapolis." She declined to name them, saying she didn't want to betray their confidence. "I think some of that is really fair," she said. "Some of it is not."
But those dynamics have seeped into discussions with the state Legislature, including the debate over helping Minneapolis recover after the looting and arson. Palmisano said legislators in some parts of the state supported those efforts and then "got slammed by their own constituents." She added that "some of the language used to sideline police, while in the moment justified, hasn't really helped the conversation move forward."
A ballot initiative proposed by the council to replace the Police Department with a new Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention was rejected by the city's charter commission. But Minneapolis Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who took the pledge, said "our efforts are inevitable as the community continues to demand change."
"The old guard leadership seems determined to continue to reach for this make-believe constituency that they believe they are losing out on at the expense of the constituency that continues to show up and deliver Democratic victories," said Ellison. "The Minneapolis City Council feels like an easy target for lazy and cowardice political analysis. … I think it will backfire and it will alienate a lot of people who do want to see immense change to public safety."
Minneapolis Council Member Steve Fletcher, another supporter of the amendment, said he didn't think the future of any political party or movement "is going to be rooted in backing away from the hard problems because we're worried about our message."
Mark Jones, a political-science professor at Rice University in Houston, said even though the election is over, Republicans will continue to prod at fault lines between progressives and moderates on issues such as the Green New Deal and the future of policing.
"It's a problematic issue for Democrats, because on one hand the progressive base wants to talk about it, but the more moderate centrists do not," he said. "You can expect Republicans, if they maintain the control of the Senate, to exploit it and try to put things on the agenda to reinforce that split in the party."

Full text: Special to the Star Tribune
Broderick Binns has always struggled to find dress shirts that properly fit.
The former Iowa defensive lineman from St. Paul has a self-described weird body: A short abdomen, not much of a neck and a wingspan of 78 inches. Six-foot-5 arms on a 6-foot man.
"The one thing you noticed about Brod, beyond him being a nice guy, is his arms," former Hawkeyes teammate Rafael Eubanks said.
Arms like that give Binns an enormous reach, physically. But the reach he has with people emotionally is what matters most in his new role with the University of Iowa athletic department.
As Iowa's executive director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Binns has been at the forefront of creating an environment of empathy in a place that has sometimes lacked it. In his role, he strives to reach a variety of people, from those who feel unwelcome to those who could improve in welcoming others.
In 2018, Iowa formed an athletics diversity task force, in which Binns took part. One of the most prominent findings through eventual interviews: Black athletes did "not feel comfortable being their authentic selves [namely around coaches]."
Then this past June, dozens of former Iowa football players used social media to allege racial bias and mistreatment during their time at Iowa. Longtime football strength coach Chris Doyle, whom many mentioned in tweets, reached a separation agreement with the university about two weeks later.
Iowa hired the Husch Blackwell firm to conduct a review, which found the program's rules "perpetuated racial or cultural biases and diminished the value of cultural diversity." The review, consisting of 111 interviews with current and former athletes and employees, found systemic problems that demeaned Black athletes.
About one month after the tweets, Iowa moved Binns permanently into his role. He had served on an interim basis while working as football's director of player development.
Binns spent time as an Iowa graduate assistant from 2014-15 after serving on the Cretin-Derham Hall coaching staff. A graduate of the St. Paul private school, Binns earned all-state honors twice. He went on to play for the Hawkeyes from 2008-11, receiving All-Big Ten second team recognition his senior year.
No matter the job or time in life, Binns always has been regarded as a helper, which is why he fits well in this job.
He's the guy who helped move Eubanks' sister into her dorm in Iowa City this past fall on short notice because one of her parents was high risk for COVID-19. He's the guy who shoveled sidewalks and mowed lawns as a kid not for money, but just the satisfaction of selflessness. His father, a pastor, instilled that, leading by example. He would drive anyone without a car to church, seeking nothing in return.
"He just had that helpful spirit that trickled down to all of us," Binns said.
Binns channels that quality often at Iowa. He helps first and foremost by being available. He meets with athletes one-on-one, striving to foster an environment of sharing. Sometimes that means talking about the day or sports. Other times, they might discuss feeling unwelcome or uncomfortable. Binns makes sure they know he's in a position to create change and communicate with senior staff.
To encourage openness, he also shares his experiences.
Listening and learning
Binns said Iowa City is not a racist city. He loves to live, work and raise a family there. But while in college about a decade ago, Binns experienced instances of microaggression -- comments or actions that subtly or unconsciously expressed prejudice.
Binns would be walking downtown to class and a white female student walking by would clutch her purse. Or, she might have moved toward a friend, away from Binns.
He began to intentionally wear clothing that displayed Iowa athletics.
"To me, that symbolizes that I'm educated, that I'm smart, that I'm not threatening, that I won't hurt you," Binns said.
Sharing such experiences has proved to be the most effective technique, Binns said, in reaching others who don't know what it's like to be Black. Lecturing on microaggressions doesn't reach students and staff as well as when Binns shares a story.
"Maybe," Binns said, "they get a better sense of, 'Maybe I need to put myself in Broderick's shoes,' or, 'You know what, that's not right.' "
Lately, there have been more active listeners. Before May 2020, Binns said conversations about race seldom happened at Iowa. George Floyd's death while in Minneapolis police custody changed that.
One hundred eighty people from Iowa athletics showed up to the voluntary town hall Binns held afterward. People wanted to learn. So Binns decided to have everyone watch the Netflix documentary, 'The 13th,' which highlights systemic racism.
The town halls continue, but not usually with the same high attendance.
"[At first] everyone was like, 'OK, we need to have these conversations,' " Binns said. "But then it fizzles out and the fire goes down. My job is to make sure the fire stays lit."
That takes different forms. Some days, he reads the book "So You Want To Talk About Race" with the women's basketball team. Another day, Binns might need to sit down with a coach or staff member and have a tough conversation about how they can rectify a situation.
Personal mission
The most effective tool Binns has employed in these conversations: perspective. Once coaches are made aware of a different experience or viewpoint, Binns said usually that perspective trickles down through the rest of the staff and team.
Normalizing these honest, perspective-sharing conversations has become vital.
"And don't put all the onus on the Black people because that is how they get burnt out and that's how they want to leave," Binns said. "So if you realize as being a Caucasian man or woman that, 'I need to educate myself. I can't always run to someone on my staff who is Black and say, 'Teach us.' "
Binns, however, has been willing to take a sizable portion of the educational load.
He compares it to squatting, a strength exercise he liked in college. His maximum lift was 550 pounds.
Binns is willing to call on his figurative back strength if it means helping others.
"Right now, more than ever, we have people listening," Binns said. "It sucks that it took George Floyd's murder for people to see or finally hear me out.
"The way I see it, I have a broad back and I can take it on, but more importantly, the people in power are starting to listen. The people with privilege are starting to listen. While I have this time in history, I have to take advantage of it."

Memorial by day, gun haven by night

Full text: By day, 38th and Chicago has become a pilgrimage site for those seeking to protest the police killing of George Floyd and other racial injustices.
But when the sun goes down, locals say, it's a different story, with gunfire ringing through the night and police sometimes nowhere to be found.
Questions surfaced. Where are the guns coming from? How did they end up in the hands of gang members who cruise the neighborhood after dark?
A case making its way through federal court might help provide some answers. The defendant, David C. Jensen, was previously indicted on charges of lying about smoking marijuana on his application to buy a gun, but new court filings show authorities suspect him of selling guns out of the trunk of his car, just as gun violence began to escalate near the Floyd memorial site.
Authorities were first tipped off to Jensen's alleged scheme on July 9 when a business owner near 38th and Chicago reported that a man had walked into his store looking to sell a box of 40-50 firearms, according to an affidavit for a search warrant. The owner told authorities that the neighborhood had effectively been taken over by gang members, who openly toted guns and set up roadblocks, deciding who should be allowed to come and go.
Investigators began canvassing local gun stores and learned that between 2013 and 2015, Jensen, now 32, had legally purchased about 50 firearms -- many of them "tactical" style rifles -- from Frontiersman Sports in Wayzata and another 11 guns from Bill's Gun Shop in Robbinsdale, according to the affidavit. Jensen, however, was banned from Frontiersman last year after he repeatedly tried to purchase firearms from customers who had come to the store to sell their guns, authorities said. Ballistics tests showed that at least two of the guns that he bought later showed up at crime scenes.
When investigators started surveillance of the Floyd memorial site, officers and ATF agents spotted Jensen in the area, driving past the barricades "used by gang members to vet who enters the area so as to allow them to conduct illicit business undisturbed," according to the affidavit.
After he left, investigators tailed Jensen to a clinic in Wayzata and later obtained a search warrant for his vehicle, which turned up five guns, loaded magazines, ammunition, body armor and drug paraphernalia, the filings say. Another 11 guns were reportedly seized during a raid of his Brooklyn Park home.
A forensic analysis of his phone revealed at least 39 text threads dating back to early 2019 related to the purchase or sale of firearms, prosecutors say. It also showed evidence that Jensen worked for a time as a firearms permit instructor at Twin Cities Carry. In some texts, Jensen reportedly bragged to others that he had "hung out with the gang bangers" near the Floyd memorial. In others, he sent photos of himself holding a gun and apparently guarding the makeshift barricades that dot the site.
Jensen, through his attorney, Bruce Nestor, has filed a motion to quash the warrant by arguing that authorities lacked probable cause to search his vehicle. When reached by telephone on Wednesday, Nestor declined to comment on the case. Jensen, who has no prior criminal history, has not been charged in connection with gun dealing.
Prosecutors conceded in response to Nestor's motion that "the situation at the George Floyd memorial has been complex and emotional, and has involved individuals with a wide array of purposes," but argued that the evidence against Jensen suggests darker motives for his visits to the site.
"Officers had various pieces of information suggesting that Jensen was far more than a law abiding gun hobbyist or a peaceful community activist -- including a high volume of firearm purchases attributed to Jensen, and various indicia that he had an inventory of guns he was selling (and/or offering to sell) out of his vehicle, in a volatile area experiencing a spike in crime," assistant U.S. attorney Ruth Shnider wrote in the filing. "The fact that a local gun shop (certainly no critic of the Second Amendment) had felt it necessary to ban Jensen from their premises for trying to purchase guns directly from customers was also strongly indicative of profit-motivated 'dealing' behavior."
The area around 38th and Chicago had long held a reputation as a hangout for gang members, but after May 25, the intersection was transformed into a sacred space for people seeking to memorialize Floyd and to heal.
Still, nighttime has brought regular gunfire, residents and authorities say. In the seven weeks after Floyd's death, there were 11 people shot and 233 ShotSpotter activations in the two-block radius around the intersection, authorities said. The area didn't have a single ShotSpotter activation during the same period last year.
Then, on July 5, police say Leneesha Columbus, who was pregnant, was fatally shot by her on-again, off-again boyfriend, who then allegedly turned his gun on a man working security nearby who tried to intervene. The baby girl was delivered but was taken off life support a month later.
In the immediate aftermath of Floyd's death, officers responding to emergencies near the square said they were frequently met with hostile crowds, and even recently, police can be heard on scanner traffic saying that they wouldn't respond to reports of gunfire in the area unless there was a victim, feeding into the perception that it was a "no-go zone" -- an area where police are reluctant to respond.
Alexandra Cooper, who lives nearby, said that Floyd's death and the subsequent rise in crime has left many of her neighbors feeling conflicted: on the one hand, they are more careful about calling law enforcement into their community.
But now, "we're talking about imminent threats to people's lives," she said.
Minneapolis police Lt. Matthew St. George said that despite the civil unrest and "historic" crime surge that followed Floyd's death, police are still doing their jobs. To prove his point, he cited recent crime statistics showing that police have recovered 945 guns from the streets, already eclipsing the 940 firearms seized all of last year. "We have a lot of officers who have left the job. We are in a place where the officers are working hard, they're doing more work than they did last year at this time, and even with all that they're continuing to do a good job and do their work, and taking guns away from bad people," said St. George, who runs the department's Assault Unit.
T.J. Valtierra said he attended several community meetings where neighbors expressed frustration with the rising crime and with outsiders who claimed to speak on behalf of their community.
"I can't say when it started, but it was shortly after [Floyd's death], we went months and months where we heard gunshots probably literally every night," said Valtierra, a youth worker and pastor who lived at 37th and Elliot until a few months ago, when he moved his family to the North Side to escape the violence.
Rashane Bryant, who runs a youth mentor program called Becoming a Man, said he thinks some of the violence stems from criminals taking advantage of the lack of police presence in the area.
Many of the gang members hanging around are not only in need of jobs, but also services addressing "mental and physical [health], self-esteem and all that." But, he said, he draws the line at people bringing guns into a community in pain.
"Yes, there are responsible people who have guns, but I can't tolerate bringing guns into our community and selling them to our people," he said. "A lot of the people that you're selling to, they're lost, and so they're not going to know what to do with them."

Goar named new CEO of Catholic Charities: Former Big Brothers chief comes to job at critical era.

Full text: Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, one of the largest nonprofits in Minnesota, has a new CEO and its first person of color in the job in its 150-year history.
Michael Goar, CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities, will start Jan. 4, Catholic Charities announced Tuesday. He steps into the new role as the social services nonprofit responds to growing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"I'm glad I'm breaking a barrier," he said of being the first person of color to head Catholic Charities, referring to the election last week of Kamala Harris, the first vice president who is a woman and person of color. "I feel like that is my calling -- to help people in our community."
Goar, who is African American and Korean, was adopted from an orphanage in South Korea by a Minneapolis couple, arriving in Minnesota at age 12 unable to speak English. He went on to graduate from Washburn High School and Minnesota State University, Mankato.
"I have personal experience of what it means to be homeless and what it means to be hungry," he said. "As a man of color and with the current environment and also my lived experience, I obviously bring a different lens to the table."
Goar has led Big Brothers Big Sisters since 2016, after serving as interim superintendent of the Minneapolis Public Schools. He also was executive director of Generation Next, a Twin Cities-based youth development organization, and previously was a school district administrator in Memphis and Boston.
"Just the fact that he has direct experience living in poverty ... I think it matters both from a symbolic perspective but also from an ability to connect through his story with our client population," said Kathleen Erickson DiGiorno, chair of the nonprofit's board of directors. "Having leaders of diversity in important community organizations is an important goal. ... We had a diverse candidate pool, and Michael rose to the top because of his overall skill set."
Goar succeeds Tim Marx, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years. Marx, a former housing commissioner and deputy mayor in St. Paul, will become Catholic Charities' first president emeritus, working on projects during the leadership transition.
Marx led Catholic Charities as it grew and evolved, adding emergency shelter beds and housing units with Higher Ground in Minneapolis in 2012 and Higher Ground St. Paul in 2017.
He wrapped up in 2019 with the $100 million Dorothy Day Place in St. Paul, which has affordable apartments and is the largest public-private partnership of its kind in state history.
Catholic Charities is also buying Augustana Health Care Center in Minneapolis to convert by 2022 into housing for veterans and others who are chronically homeless in a $65 million project.
Under his leadership, Catholic Charities has also narrowed its focus, ending refugee resettlement and adoption programs and announcing this year the closure of St. Joseph's Home for Children, the former Minneapolis orphanage.
Now, Goar will take the helm at a challenging time for nonprofits confronting financial strain during the COVID-19 pandemic and the racial reckoning after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Marx said earlier this year that Catholic Charities was spending $1 million more a month on extra food, cleanings and staff overtime, dipping into reserves to cover a $5 million deficit for its fiscal year that ended June 30.
With 600 employees, Catholic Charities was too large to qualify for federal coronavirus aid that smaller nonprofits received.
"Vulnerable communities I think have been impacted so deeply by the pandemic, by the racial unrest caused by the George Floyd murder," Erickson DiGiorno said. "I think it really is a pivotal time. ... I'm also hoping that he and Catholic Charities can help be a voice in the community to contribute in a positive way to issues of systematic racism."
The board, which unanimously approved the decision to select Goar, hasn't released his salary publicly, but according to public data, Marx was paid $303,637 a year as CEO.

Full text: The trial of four former Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd will be livestreamed because of a judge's historic order Thursday allowing cameras and audio in the Minneapolis courtroom for the March trial.
Citing immense global interest in the case, limited courthouse space and restricted public movements because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Peter Cahill said the "only way to vindicate the defendants' constitutional right to a public trial and the media's and public's constitutional rights of access to criminal trials is to allow audio and video coverage of the trial."
The live broadcast of a high-profile trial in a Minnesota state court is without precedent and the decision was greeted with enthusiasm by the media and First Amendment lawyers who say it is both welcome and overdue. Cameras are rarely allowed, even though many other states have permitted them for decades. Defense attorneys for Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao filed a joint motion in June requesting camera access at all pretrial hearings and at the trial or trials.
But Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is overseeing prosecution, opposed the motion. Typically, Minnesota rules allow trials to be broadcast only if all the parties agreed.
A spokesman for Ellison said only that he is "evaluating" Cahill's ruling. He has the option to appeal.
Cahill grounded his ruling in the U.S. Constitution, citing the First Amendment guarantee of press and public access to trials as well as the Sixth Amendment guarantee to defendants that the public may see they are "fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned."
Under normal circumstances, spectators can come and go from courtrooms as they please, but these are not normal times, the order said. Social distancing requirements because of the pandemic tightly restrict the number of people who can be in courtrooms.
Even though a special courtroom has been configured in Hennepin County for this trial, spacing constraints will allow little "if any" -- room for spectators. "That includes not only family members and friends of George Floyd and the defendants, but also members of the public and the press," Cahill wrote.
During a recent hearing on the case, the judge noted that a limited number of media were allowed to watch the proceedings in a separate courtroom from a live feed via a static, fixed camera.
In a separate order Thursday, Cahill ordered the four defendants to stand trial together, requiring four socially distanced defense tables for the men and their lawyers. The judge said interest in the case will continue to outstrip the court's ability to provide access to the trial in the courthouse.
Cahill acknowledged that his ruling went further in providing access than outlined in the Minnesota rules, but he said absent the accommodations, the public would be left with nothing but the arguments of the lawyers. "That is hardly the basis for the public to participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial process," he wrote.
Mitchell Hamline School of Law Prof. Raleigh Levine said, "This ruling is not only unusual for Minnesota but it goes farther than the U.S. Supreme Court has gone in interpreting the very broad right to public access." Levine noted that the order is carefully written to address this particular case in these unusual times, not to create a blanket permission of cameras.
"Given the intense feelings that the murder has generated, I think it makes a lot of sense to say we can avoid a lot of angst, we can possibly even avoid protests if people can see what's going on in the courthouse and reassure themselves as to the fair administration of the trial by the judge," Levine said.
Defense lawyer Earl Gray, who represents Lane, has tried many cases in Wisconsin where cameras are allowed.
"It doesn't interfere with anybody's procedures in the courtroom," Gray said. "We never show the jury. They're never on TV. It's just the witnesses, the judge and the lawyer. I thought that's way overdue."
The decision was well received by those who have long advocated for greater transparency in Minnesota courtrooms.
"I'm thrilled," said Jane Kirtley, a lawyer, professor and director of the Silha Center for Media Ethics and the Law at the University of Minnesota. "This is the kind of memorandum I'm going to give my students to say, 'This is what a judge should say about cameras in the courtroom.' "
Suki Dardarian, Star Tribune managing editor, called the decision historic on many fronts.
"Minnesota's rules on cameras in the courtroom are among the most restrictive in the country, so we are extremely gratified that the court determined that both the defendants' right to a fair, public trial and the media's right of access can be met by providing live coverage," she said.
Both Kirtley and Dardarian are veterans of the fight for access to proceedings in the 2019 trial of former Minneapolis police officer Mohammed Noor in the death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Because of restrictive rulings by Hennepin County Judge Kathryn Quaintance in that case, a media coalition was formed to fight for access to evidence. Earlier this year, the coalition successfully fought for the release of body camera videos recorded by police officers the night Floyd was killed, which were filed into evidence by their attorneys.
Now, there's hope that Cahill's order will be catalytic beyond the Floyd trial, opening courtrooms to cameras in future trials. "If this goes well, we'll have an example of here's a case that had all these challenges and everybody's constitutional rights were protected," Kirtley said.

Full text: The four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's killing will be tried together in Hennepin County instead of separately in suburban or outstate Minnesota, a judge ruled Thursday.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill rejected motions filed by each defense attorney for a change of venue, requests that activists and attorneys for Floyd's family had criticized as attempts to sidestep justice by trying the cases in rural, predominantly white counties. Floyd was Black.
Cahill granted a motion filed by Attorney General Keith Ellison's office to try the defendants -- Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- in one trial.
Each defense attorney had argued for individual trials, citing antagonistic defenses that would complicate a joint trial as they blame co-defendants in order to protect their clients.
"Conducting four separate monthlong trials could potentially take a couple of years, delaying justice," Cahill wrote. " … Forcing the community and this State to endure four separate trials … is likely to compound and prolong the trauma to the community and the State."
Cahill issued a slew of other orders that shaped how the March 8 trial will unfold.
He granted defense attorneys' joint request to allow cameras at trial, an unprecedented move.
The judge also ruled that jurors' identities will remain anonymous to the public until after trial, that up to four alternate jurors will be seated instead of the typical one and that jurors will be sequestered during deliberations.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, issued a statement praising the rulings.
"Trying these officers together will give the jury a complete picture of what happened on the day that George was murdered," Crump said. "The judge's decision to keep the trial in Minneapolis is the right one. We never see Black defendants get a change of venue to increase the fairness of their trials, and the White officers involved in the death of George Floyd should rightly face a jury of their peers in the city where this tragedy took place."
Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, said in a written statement that he was reviewing the orders.
"My goal is to assure that a fair trial occurs for Mr. Kueng," Plunkett said. "We are happy to have the orders so we can start preparing for our trial and presenting the truth in front of a jury."
Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, declined to comment aside from supporting cameras in the courtroom.
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, declined to comment. Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, did not return a message seeking comment.
Cahill cited several factors supporting a joint trial: the similarity of the evidence in the four cases, the toll separate trials could take on witnesses, and financial and time constraints on the courts. Finding impartial jurors could become increasingly difficult if separate trials were held, he reasoned, adding that logistical complications imposed by the global COVID-19 pandemic also favored one trial.
Cahill noted that a 17-year-old girl, Darnella Frazier, recorded the incident on her cellphone and will be a key witness along with her 9-year-old cousin, Judeah Reynolds, who was also present. The impact on eyewitnesses has greater import when they are minors, whom the law deems as particularly "vulnerable," he wrote.
Despite defense attorneys' claims, there is no indication that they will use "antagonistic" defenses that require individual trials, the judge wrote.
Cahill said attorneys have voiced similar defenses -- that their clients were authorized to use force because Floyd refused to enter a squad car -- that contradict the notion of antagonistic defenses.
"In addition, all defendants contend that Floyd's death resulted from his underlying medical conditions, heart disease, and hypertension acting in combination with several drugs found in his system," Cahill wrote.
In ruling against a change of venue, Cahill said the law requires trials to be held in the county where the alleged crime occurred unless specific conditions arise. Each defense attorney asked that the trial be moved, proposing Clay, Dakota and Stearns counties as possible venues, among others.
They argued that media coverage of Floyd's May 25 killing tainted the local jury pool. They also asserted that Hennepin County is unsafe after protesters allegedly assaulted a lawyer and defendant following a September hearing, and after a protester was allegedly found with a gun and knives in the Hennepin County courthouse following an October hearing. Cahill wrote that smaller courthouses would not improve safety, and that "no corner of the state of Minnesota has been shielded" from coverage of Floyd's death.
He described the ruling as "preliminary" and subject to change pending public opinion surveys being conducted by defense attorneys and pending the results of questionnaires that will be administered to potential jurors in Hennepin County.
Cahill said that while most protesters have been peaceful, defense attorneys' safety concerns were credible and that he had received "many" voice mails, notes and letters from the public "demanding that the Court decide the case in a certain way, most often against the Defendants."
"Most of these communications have been respectful, but more than one message has been hostile and threatening," he wrote.
Cahill also reversed a previous decision banning County Attorney Mike Freeman and three of his attorneys from working on the case. He vacated the ban, allowing them to participate in the prosecution but not as advocates at trial or signees on motions.
Ellison, who is leading the prosecution with assistance from Freeman's office, issued a statement describing Cahill's rulings as "measured and thoughtful."
"I'm satisfied by the court's decisions today," Ellison said. "The murder of George Floyd occurred in Minneapolis, and it is right that the defendants should be tried in Minneapolis. It is also true that they acted in concert with each other and the evidence against them is similar, so it is right to try them in one trial."
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. Kueng, Lane and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting. All four are free on bond.

GIVING BACK: PUBLIC ART ASSISTS IN PLACEMAKING

Author: Regan, Sheila

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 11/7/2020: This story misspelled the name of muralist Reggie LeFlore. As Twin Cities districts rebuild, public art has been a visible element. Arts organizations like Juxtaposition Arts, Creatives After Curfew and Public Functionary have covered boarded-up businesses with social-justice-inspired art. Permanent murals and pop-up events encourage neighbors to come out, meet each other, support businesses and help community members recognize that we are all in this together.
Projects include events like the one recently presented by Barebones Puppets, which included Masanari Kawahara performing in the Butoh tradition at the razed Arby's site on Lake Street in south Minneapolis.
In St. Paul, Midway Contemporary Art hosts public-art projects in the HmongTown Marketplace in Frogtown. There you can see Pao Her's gorgeous light boxes in the cafeteria. Farther west on University Avenue, the Creative Enterprise Zone initiative has commissioned six huge murals on buildings in the St. Anthony Park neighborhood.
These creative projects are examples of "placemaking" -- an important part of preventing displacement and gentrification in neighborhoods.
"It's one of the many things we underwrite and we seek when purchasing properties," said Eddie Landenberger, a vice president and senior manager at Lank Bank Twin Cities, which helps local businesses compete with private investors and developers. "Every commercial node should have placemaking as an interest and a priority."
One of the artists in the Creative Enterprise Zone project is Reggie Le Flor. As a Black artist, Le Flor said he felt traumatized from the brutality of George Floyd's death, but also from the way Floyd's image was exploited afterward.
"I was immediately approached in the social media realm by several folks wanting me to paint George Floyd murals, and George Floyd T-shirts and hats," Le Flor said. "I really just wasn't in the right mental space
for any of that stuff. It's sickening, you know, to see all of this happen so quick after the atrocity happened. And so I wanted to stay away from it."
Le Flor's mural "The Afrocentric Spectrum" outside of the Twin Cities Janitor Supply building at 2345 W. University Av. has an Afrofuturist theme, depicting a demigoddess who is reconnecting with her African roots and a storyteller character who draws on cultural forms of the Black and African diaspora.
"There's a ton of power and opportunity to really have these discussions about environments and communities through public art," Le Flor said. "One of the goals that I have with my work is to try to approach that in an ethical sense, while also understanding that there's just an absence of Black presence in a lot of these murals and a lot of these public-art pieces."
None of the murals in the 2020 CEZ Summer Mural Project directly speak to the trauma of Floyd's death, but that trauma is nevertheless present. Beatrix Jar's whimsical bird mural offers a bit of delight as a balm for troubled times. "I feel like for this mural, it was about creating something optimistic and happy," said Beatrix Jar artist Bianca Pettis. "It's sort of an opportunity to create something kind of funny and magical for people, to sort of get out of those moments of feeling really distressed about everything that's happening in the world."
Witt Siasoco's mural of a young boy of color reaching out for a plant growing amid concrete speaks to our need to reconnect to nature, even amid urban development. After all, it's easy to forget why the civil unrest happened in the first place. Like an infected wound, it required an incision in order to heal. The work that's happening now is messy and difficult, but necessary.
"Maybe the wild stuff is what we need more of," Siasoco said. "It's not just nature, it's people. The wild things that are happening on the street right now. Maybe we need to look at it differently. Just figure that it's going to grow into something beautiful, and it contributes to our city, too."

GIVING BACK: SHAKING THE FOUNDATIONS ; CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW BOLSTERING THEIR RACIAL JUSTICE WORK -- FROM DIVERSIFYING LEADERSHIP TO RETOOLING GRANTS.

Full text: The death of George Floyd has mobilized Minnesota philanthropists and funders into action like never before.
Charitable foundations have traditionally issued statements condemning racism after police have shot and killed Black Minnesotans. But "in years past, that's sort of where it ended," said Pahoua Yang Hoffman.
"Foundations ... and corporate entities were really being called out by the community, and I think rightfully so," said Yang Hoffman, senior vice president of community impact at the St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation.
"What we're seeing now -- a call and an increase in generosity in ways we haven't seen -- is completely connected to George Floyd himself, the killing but also the increasing momentum of Black Lives Matter."
Across Minnesota, institutions have boosted racial justice funding after the death of Floyd, 46, at the hands of Minneapolis police in May sparked international outrage and calls for change. Across the state, foundations and corporations have distributed millions of dollars to organizations to address community healing, racial inequities and policy changes.
But they're doing more than just handing out more money. Many are looking internally at how they can reform philanthropy, both by distributing grants more inclusively and by increasing diversity among staff and board members.
"I think the death and the video of George Floyd activated so many people -- including philanthropy -- in new ways," said Chanda Smith Baker, senior vice president of impact at the Minneapolis Foundation. "Philanthropy is not the only sector that's stepped up. ... It's business, it's community, it's government -- there are all these pieces that are responding in new ways and I'm greatly looking forward to new solutions that will emerge."
Minnesota is grappling with colliding crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, the ensuing economic crisis and the racial reckoning after Floyd's death. Foundations and nonprofits have also bolstered resources for COVID-19 and rebuilding businesses damaged in the civil unrest. In fact, a majority of foundations surveyed by the Minnesota Council on Foundations expanded giving this year from what was planned, and expect to give more in 2021 to nonprofits led by people of color and Black and Indigenous leaders.
'Newfound commitment'
The Minneapolis-based Headwaters Foundation for Justice is looking at short- and long-term needs to support both rebuilding businesses and pushing for racial justice. Target Corp. has pledged $10 million to social justice organizations. And U.S. Bank dedicated $5 million for local organizations rebuilding and addressing trauma.
"There has been a newfound commitment to racial equity and racial justice like I've never seen before," said Susan Bass Roberts, executive director of the Pohlad Family Foundation, which has vowed to put $25 million toward racial justice. "It is putting a mirror up to ourselves and asking ourselves what does it really mean to embrace racial justice, and looking at our practices and policies."
The Pohlad foundation, which has focused on homelessness, has pivoted to address racial disparities among homeless Minnesotans, and for the first time has invited community members to make grant decisions instead of just relying on board members.
In September, in response to Floyd's death, the Minneapolis Foundation doled out an extra $500,000 to groups focused on healing and addressing systemic inequities. The funding, which followed other grants for rebuilding and for businesses owned by Black and Indigenous leaders or other people of color, came from a fund established in 2018 to address and prevent violence.
One of the 40 groups that received a grant is Northside Boxing Club, which dozens of north Minneapolis kids and teens visit each day for a meal and a workout. It's not just about boxing, but a safe place for social/emotional support, where young people can talk through the pain and anger after another Black American's death has horrified the nation.
"When someone falls down, we pick them up," said Ryan Burnet, the restaurateur who started the nonprofit club in 2015. Burnet plans to expand distance-learning opportunities for students there, and to teach important subjects such as financial literacy.
Healing trauma
The Minneapolis Foundation also teamed up with the Greater Twin Cities United Way and the St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation on a new initiative to reform the criminal justice system.
Since March, United Way has awarded $2.4 million as part of its COVID-19 grants. It recently announced $250,000 in grants to make food access in north Minneapolis more equitable for low-income immigrants, refugees and people of color -- from urban gardens to mobile markets.
Just days after Floyd died, the St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation awarded $100,000 to heal racial trauma, helping the St. Louis Park-based African American Leadership Forum (AALF) boost mental health with everything from virtual therapy sessions to in-person Zumba classes.
"I think this is something community organizations have been asking for for years," said Marcus Owens, the executive director of AALF, of the increased flexible funding. He added that philanthropy needs to use community feedback to drive grant decisions, not force nonprofits to tailor their work to meet grant requirements.
Addressing inequities
In fact, the St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation is simplifying its grant applications to reduce barriers and fund general operations, not specific projects, making grant funding more flexible. Yang Hoffman said the foundation is also recruiting employees new to philanthropy to diversify staffing and redistribute power.
The foundation is one of more than 20 organizations that have backed a new coalition to reform philanthropy, denounce racism and raise $25 million for Black-led nonprofits and advocacy groups. The Philanthropic Collective to Combat Anti-Blackness & Realize Racial Justice, unveiled in July, is led by Smith Baker of the Minneapolis Foundation, Lulete Mola at the Women's Foundation of Minnesota and Repa Mekha at Nexus Community Partners.
The Women's Foundation has also shifted funding to focus more on nonprofits doing racial-justice work. But the organization is also making long-term changes -- adding more people of color to its board and planning to launch a racial justice initiative in 2021.
"There is a renewed sense of energy; foundations in particular are feeling a responsibility to more directly address racial justice," said Gloria Perez, the recently appointed first woman-of-color CEO at the Women's Foundation. "We need to really double down."

GIVING BACK: REBUILD THIS CITY ; UNREST-SCARRED BUSINESSES ARE BUILDING BACK WITH THE HELP OF PHILANTHROPY AND THE COMMUNITY.

Full text: Special to the Star Tribune
Sammy's Avenue Eatery on W. Broadway in north Minneapolis sits in one of the hardest-hit areas of the civil unrest that followed George Floyd's death at the hands of police.
The cafe's picture windows were untouched, in part because a group of neighbors stood guard outside. Now the windows offer a clear view of the brightly colored walls of Juxtaposition Arts across the street, but also of a marred U.S. Bank building that remains closed.
West Broadway, like E. Lake Street in Minneapolis and parts of W. University Avenue in St. Paul, caught heavy damage during the unrest. The destroyed, defaced or shuttered buildings are a physical reminder of the work that is still left to do for the Twin Cities to rebuild.
For many businesses owned by Black and Indigenous people and people of color, the double whammy of the unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic added to struggles they already faced because of the discrimination and disparities that have long plagued the metro area. Now these businesses are rebuilding with the help of the philanthropic community, city leaders, community members and artists. Key to that work is addressing systemic racism.
For a recent Friday morning interview, cafe owner Sammy McDowell took a break from making soup for the weekend, when customers flock to his two storefronts in north and northeast Minneapolis. He also has a burgeoning catering business and side projects such as providing breakfast for kids from low-income families.
McDowell has always given back to the community. During the unrest, Sammy's became an ad hoc mutual-aid spot, where neighbors could get groceries, clothes and other essential supplies.
"We became the grocery store, pantry, food giveaway space," McDowell said. "We did that for almost a month."
The eatery provided solace, too, something it has been doing all along. "We've always tried to be that space for people to come and vent and let it all out, and leave with a different perspective," McDowell said.
Now McDowell has seen that care toward the community come back to him. His business has gotten support from the Northside Economic Opportunity Network (NEON), an organization based in north Minneapolis.
"When everything started going crazy, they stepped up and called us, and made sure we were OK," McDowell said. "They told us about every opportunity they knew about. Not only did they tell me about it, they did a lot of the paperwork and footwork. They were proactive in getting us PPP funding, and shuffling through all that mumbo-jumbo."
A new coalition
Warren McLean, NEON's president, said the organization has disbursed about $1.8 million in grants and loans to businesses in north Minneapolis. Much of those resources have been used to keep businesses afloat following the initial impact of Minnesota's stay-at-home orders this past spring. "It was survival," McLean said. "It was meeting their rent payments, paying employees, things like that."
NEON works closely with other North Side businesses and nonprofits coordinating relief efforts, such as the West Broadway Area Coalition, the Black Women's Wealth Alliance, the
Mortenson Family Foundation and TRI Construction. NEON is also part of the Twin Cities Community Rebuilding Coalition. That coalition brings together community and economic development groups, nonprofit organizations and city leaders to address the needs of businesses and organizations affected by the turmoil of 2020 in a way that prioritizes businesses owned by people of color.
One huge barrier for such businesses has been discrimination in lending, according to Va-Megn Thoj, executive director of the Asian Economic Development Association, based on University Avenue in St. Paul in an area they've helped rebrand as Little Mekong.
"Historically, we know that lending has been racist," Thoj said. "I know many people, in many different positions of leadership, are talking about addressing systemic racism. But the bottom line is that they haven't really owned up to the fact that lending, whether it's government or private, is always stacked up against minority-owned businesses."
According to Thoj, factors that need to be addressed include lending criteria for minority owners. "Lending will have to be less punitive," he said. "And I think lending needs to look at more than just a credit score, and how much capital someone has already in order to access a loan."
Creating future wealth
That's one reason why the Hamline Midway Coalition is focused on wealth-building. "Many of these minority- and immigrant-owned businesses have opened in buildings that offered cheap rent," said Director Kate Mudge. "These building owners are not always responsive to their tenant needs."
In partnership with African Development Solutions, philanthropic groups and city leaders like St. Paul City Council Member Mitra Jalali, the Hamline coalition is focused on helping business owners buy their own building through a cooperative model.
That idea is taking hold in Minneapolis, as well, through groups such as City of Lakes Community Land Trust. One of the land trust's most recent ventures focuses on opening up space for businesses to build wealth by buying the properties they occupy.
According to Domonique Jones, a program director at City of Lakes, business owners of color are a major focus in the initiative. "Now there's a big focus on commercial development and community development and anti-displacement," Jones said.
Of course, those were priorities even before George Floyd's death.
"It hasn't changed a lot for us," Jones said. "It has pushed our movement along."

Full text: Before George Floyd died in police custody on a Minneapolis street, Vikings 21-year-old wide receiver Justin Jefferson wasn't that motivated to vote.
"Honestly, I wasn't into it," Jefferson said. "I didn't know much about it. I never know who to vote for. I never knew who was the right person to be in office."
But over the summer, Jefferson did the work. His mom helped him register to vote in his home state of Louisiana. He started researching which candidates up and down the ballot would best reflect his most important issue -- addressing America's racial inequality and police brutality.
"It just feels like I needed to do that," Jefferson said. "Every vote really counts, and it'd be a shame if I didn't put my vote into it."
Whether registering to vote for the first time or urging others to vote -- through their considerable social media platforms -- Minnesota sports figures and teams have been motivated since Floyd's death on May 25. Their voices have been louder than ever, and have drawn backlash.
"I do think the murder of George Floyd was maybe a call to action," Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said. "It felt different. And it felt different around the world, not just here locally."
A few days after Floyd's death, Minnesota United midfielder Jacori Hayes saw companies, sports leagues and many others voicing support for the Black Lives Matter movement on social media -- for instance, by posting black squares on Instagram in solidarity.
Then he posted on the team's website.
"What is going to happen when it's no longer cool to voice these opinions?" the 25-year-old Hayes wrote in a post tweeted by the team to its 150,000 followers. "Will you vote for candidates that lower your taxes but completely disregard the social injustices of minorities? Will you return to silence when I and others like me still face racial prejudice?"
Hayes, who shared the post with his 3,200 Instagram followers and 1,900 Twitter followers, said he's worried the fervor of that time has faded, and this election -- as a litmus test for how Americans view race relations -- may show it.
"You can already see some of the people that posted the black squares on social media have maybe gone on to say other things," Hayes said. "Or another event happened and they're voicing a conflicting opinion to what the black square was supposed to represent. But I commend a lot of the friends that are still vocal about it."
Hayes said he has become more active in voicing his views on social media, such as posting pictures of himself wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts. It's an approach several athletes have been using to encourage people to vote, in part to make voting seem like a trendy thing to do.
Using their platform
"It can be looked at as cool when people see all of us retweeting and reposting stuff," said 27-year-old Lynx guard Rachel Banham, whose social media reach includes 13,800 followers on Instagram and 11,600 on Twitter. "Like for example when people see Sue Bird or LeBron [James] talking about going out to vote, even kids now who aren't able to vote might be looking like that like, 'Wow, I can't wait to vote.' "
It's a way for athletes to give voice to prominent activists and other political leaders. For example, a simple retweet or repost by James goes to a staggering 48 million followers on Twitter and 74 million on Instagram.
"I'm not an expert in criminal justice reform, but there's people who have dedicated their lives to that," Hayes said. "We all have platforms to be able to voice what those professionals are saying."
That's also important given that 18% of adults get their news mainly from social media, a Pew research poll found. The figure is believed to be much higher among millennials and Gen Z, the age when people are historically least likely to vote.
"Twitter tells everything," said Jefferson, with 77,000 followers and 434,000 followers on Instagram. "I've been on Twitter seeing everything, just listening to what the president has been saying, seeing what Joe Biden has been saying."
Not just presidential race
Jefferson said his voting interest extends beyond who will occupy the White House. It's a point Minnesota teams have been trying to convey to players. Reeve said she was guilty of paying the most attention to the high-profile races on the ballot and not so much the down-ballot races.
"This is why I say I'm so mad at myself, you have these revelations much later in life that the local elections … I would argue some of these other positions are far more important to our daily lives," Reeve said.
It's also something the Timberwolves drove home as they said they have registered all their players to vote and helped their families do so with the help of assistant general manager Joe Branch.
"A lot of our people, our ancestors, didn't have the right to vote," said Timberwolves forward Jarred Vanderbilt, 21. "It's very important to not only vote for the presidential election but … who's in the Senate, who's a judge, all that stuff."
'Stick to sports' backlash
Locally, the Wolves and Lynx held three voter registration events and have resources through their website available as part of their "Pack the Vote" initiative. The Twins provided similar resources on their website. The Vikings pledged to get 100% of their organization registered to vote. Minnesota United helped make Allianz Field a ballot drop-off site in Ramsey County.
Former Viking Cris Carter partnered with Yahoo to try to increase voter registration while also speaking to NFL players about the issue. Some of their activism, he said, is more behind the scenes than out front, such as getting their families registered to vote.
"Because of everything going on publicly, a lot of guys feel like 'I got to do something …' " Carter said. "There's different ways they can make an impact."
Carter said several NFL players still fear the backlash former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick experienced after he began taking a knee during the national anthem to peacefully protest systemic racism and police brutality. Kaepernick hasn't played for an NFL team since 2016.
For athletes, backlash to taking a stand on political issues can attract comments on social media telling them to "stick to sports."
"We're in a unique position where we can inform a lot of the general public of these different issues," Hayes said. "It's not on an athlete to be outspoken about different issues if they don't want to be. It's definitely on each player if they feel comfortable and want to take on that responsibility."
Reeve and the Lynx have been among the most outspoken franchises in sports. Four years before Floyd's death, they wore T-shirts that read, in part, "Change starts with us" and "Black Lives Matter" on the back after the police shooting deaths of Philando Castile in St. Paul and Alton Sterling in Louisiana.
Reeve said if people look up to athletes and expect them to do good in the community, then people shouldn't be surprised when athletes speak their minds concerning how to accomplish that.
"You can't say suddenly now an athlete can't have a voice when you look to them to be so much for your community as leaders," Reeve said.
After Election Day
Athletes vowed to continue to push for social justice after Tuesday's elections, though it's hard to say what that will look like.
Hayes said it's a waste of energy to try to convince everyone that those changes need to happen. There won't be 100% agreement, but change can still happen with each election.
"As long as we're trying to do our best to make those changes every day and in each election, I think we're doing the right things versus trying to convince others that people are humans or deserve justice just like everyone else," Hayes said.
Jefferson got to visit President Donald Trump at the White House after LSU won the national championship in January. Trump even joked with Jefferson about the amount of money he would make in the NFL.
"That was one of the best experiences of my life," Jefferson said. "I didn't really care too much about who was the president at the time. I just wanted to be there for the experience."
He didn't give much thought at the time to voting, the role he can play in saying who gets to occupy that house. But when Floyd died five months later, Jefferson, like others, took that responsibility seriously for the first time.
"I ain't going to say [voting] is going to solve everything," Jefferson said. "But I feel like it's a step. If we all agree on the right person to be in office, that's just a step in the right direction."

Making his mark: How George Floyd's death reframed the life of a longtime Minneapolis artist.

Full text: Peyton Scott Russell can't quite explain why, when he was painting George Floyd's face, he dripped a burst of aerosol on Floyd's cheek. A tear, falling from Floyd's eye.
He hadn't planned it. But that's what he sees now, too.
He can't quite explain how the painting, 12 feet tall and so heavy it took a team to lift, ended up where it did at 38th and Chicago. Bolted to a bus shelter, also 12 feet tall.
He hadn't measured it. But that's where it fit, nearly flush.
All he can say is that something was guiding his making of that mural, which he painted, weeping, during the curfew, as the city was smoldering. Peyton, as he prefers to be known, is not a religious person, "but it was like God was leading the whole thing -- every step."
This moment in Minneapolis, made more vivid and immediate by the murals that appeared on plywood and pavement, has transformed Peyton, a pioneering graffiti writer
and teaching artist. The 51-year-old is making, perhaps for the first time, protest art. Pieces that have defined the movement. Pieces that will likely cement his legacy.
Unlike the colorful mural of Floyd that first appeared on that corner, Peyton's massive, grayscale portrait captured, with its tone and its tear, the tragedy of what went down there. His achromatic "K" in the multi-artist Black Lives Matter street painting on Plymouth Avenue N. had a solemn attitude, too. Then there's his stately painting titled "Rise Up," on Highpoint Center for Printmaking: a young Black girl, her fist in the air.
"I knew art was powerful, but I have been discovering its ability to change things and move people," he said. "It's a new frame, but I am starting to see."
Until recently, his most famous work was unsigned: He was the artist who, perched on a pile of flowers in front of First Avenue, turned Prince's star gold.
For decades, Peyton has been painting his name across boxcars and bridges. But the murals he's made
recently, works that grapple with identity and power, are becoming a different kind of signature.
During a summer that thrust new attention on street art -- along with its sometimes messy politics -- Peyton drew on his deep roots in both north and south Minneapolis with artists young and old, on buildings and behind the scenes.
"I've witnessed a sensei, if you will, taking his rightful place with his ability to translate and emote what people are feeling through fine art that has a street influence," said Houston White, owner of barbershop-meets-boutique Houston White Men's Room. As a teenager, White became Peyton's first student, trading haircuts for screenprinting lessons in Peyton's studio, where the North Side nonprofit Juxtaposition Arts was born.
"As a fifty-year-old biracial man who was raised in a place where Prince was created, he's found his place in his dojo," White said. "I see him getting real comfortable in his own skin."
Finding his voice
Peyton grew up on that corner. Before Cup Foods was Cup Foods, back when the Speedway was a 7-Eleven, he and his brother Kai lived in that neighborhood and biked to those stores.
When he saw the video of Floyd, a police officer pinning his neck to the pavement, he saw his dad's face, too.
"I kept thinking, if I were there, what would I have done? I would have been dead, too."
He wanted to protest. He wanted to fight. But his mentors reminded him: Use the voice you've honed. So instead, he painted.
The plan was to create large-scale portraits of Floyd, dropping them off in different spots around the city, in the middle of the street. Intrusive, in-your-face, "guerrilla-style art," he said. Sculptor Andrew MacGuffie built him the canvas, so big he couldn't project his rendering of Floyd's selfie onto it at the right angle.
So Peyton had to do it old-school, sketching a grid.
He'd made many grids before. When he was 14, Peyton watched the documentary film "Style Wars," about the hip-hop and graffiti scene in New York City, and within days was spray painting under a bridge. He focused on printmaking at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, fell in love with Abstract Impressionism. He became a teacher, a professional kickboxer (for a time) and a father of two.
But he kept coming back to graffiti, to the detriment of his relationship. "It's 2009, 2010, and I'm out painting trains again," he said, shaking his head.
Peyton loves the fuzziness and opacity of spray paint. The feel of the can in his hand helps him forget the ache in his hip. Writing on a wall late at night, in bright, slanted, stylized letters, he feels a touch of immortality. His name, suddenly part of the landscape.
Not his birth name, but his graffiti alias, Daesk. That's what his mother called him, growing up, and what he named his son ("on his birth certificate and everything").
Having children pushed Peyton to clarify his purpose. In 2011, depressed and broke, he applied for a Bush Fellowship, writing unapologetically about graffiti, treating it like the fine art it is. He won and, years after leaving Juxtaposition Arts, built a new teaching venture, SprayFinger.
This summer, when the plywood appeared, he brought his students out to paint and to witness a shift. The community had the chance to watch "in real time" as artists spoke their minds via murals, he said.
"I think that really opened the door to have people look at street art in a different way."
'A gift' to the community
Up on a lift beside a brick building, 20 feet in the air, Peyton shook a can of spray paint as his kids played on the grass below. Pink, first -- long and loose across a stencil of a man's face. Puffs of purple, next. He tossed down an empty, and Daesk, now 13, ran over to grab it.
With his left hand, Peyton sprayed some red. Pshhh. Pshhh. Pshhh. He paused, stepped back, then gently lifted the stencil to reveal a man's glasses, smile and beard. The face of a person who purchased a nearby home.
Dozens of bright, stenciled faces now cover the side of the City of Lakes Community Land Trust, a nonprofit on Glenwood Avenue N. that works to make buying homes more affordable. During workshops, the new homeowners helped craft those stencils, Peyton said, giving them ownership of the mural, too.
Usually when he's working on a wall, people stop to chat. But with this piece, people stayed quiet. Reverent, even. He realized they were looking for particular faces -- Philando Castile and Breonna Taylor, among them.
"That's the time we live in," he said.
These times have hit Peyton hard. He's been confronting the struggles of growing up in a mixed-race family, the memories of police pulling him over and roughing him up. "The suffering and the pain of our community, generation after generation."
So, when Doritos and ICU Arts contacted him about making a mural, he focused on the hope of the youngest generation: a Black girl raising her fist so high it breaks the frame.
It took four tries to find that piece a home. The owners of one spot even argued that it would promote civil unrest, he said.
Once the threat of fire and damage subsided, some Minneapolis businesses abandoned the Black Lives Matter messages they'd affixed to their windows. But Highpoint Center wanted something that would last, said Cole Rogers, its artistic director. Rogers had been talking to another artist to use its bright white building at 912 W. Lake St. as a canvas when he heard that Peyton, whom he had known during his screenprinting days, was looking for a place to do a mural.
"I saw the image and said, 'Omigod, yes,' " Rogers said, choking up at the memory. "When it was 99 percent done, the model and her family came to see it. It was obviously such a gift to that family -- and to the community.
"It was a life raft."
Rogers, a master printer, sees in Peyton's recent murals a culmination of his past artistic lives. The stenciling reminds him of pochoir, a French form of printmaking used by Picasso and other fine artists. The color is dabbed through with a short-hair brush, or in Peyton's case, spray paint.
"What he's doing is very dear to my heart," Rogers said.
Prince's gold star
Peyton has experienced once before the sense of kismet that brought his piece to 38th and Chicago.
When Prince died in 2016, Peyton first felt numb. He had a complicated history with the superstar who soundtracked his youth.
It was Prince who brought him back from Chicago: Peyton had become a bootleg-collecting fan by the time he was invited to show his art at Prince's Glam Slam rock club in 1993. He then worked as a scenic artist at Paisley Park, where the superstar proved to be an ever-elusive, often-frustrating boss. Peyton cut out, eager to do his own thing. He stopped playing Prince's albums.
But after his death, Peyton started listening, started remembering. "It was like I lost a family member."
A former student had taught him how to apply gold leaf and, suddenly, he knew how he'd give his thanks. He waited a few weeks for the crowds outside First Ave to quiet. In the darkness, with a few friends keeping watch, he taped off the star on the brick wall, set the varnish and brushed on the gold.
He hadn't thought to bring a stepstool. But bouquets left by fans brought him to just the right height.
"I remember thinking, I don't care if I get arrested -- I just have to get it done. If I get caught midstream, I'd become the guy who [messed] up the Prince star."
Instead, City Pages dubbed him the "benevolent mystery vandal."
"I kind of liked that," he said, smiling.
Prince pops up twice in Peyton's most recent mural, which he made as "a gift to the community." For years, he's been itching to paint the long wall on Wally's Foods on Penn Avenue N. Last fall, before the cold cut things short, he started gridding the letters -- NORTHSIDE -- filling some in with faces of families, neighbors and people who frequent that corner, including barber and entrepreneur Houston White and his late wife, Donise.
On a recent Sunday, surrounded by cans and paintbrushes, Peyton stepped close, pressing his spray-paint-splattered fingers against a new line, then walked back, taking in the panorama. He nodded.
An 8-year-old girl with a ponytail ran up to the mural. She pointed to one face she recognized, then the next: "Mom, look!"

FIVE SIGNATURE WORKS BY PEYTON SCOTT RUSSELL
1. "Icon of a Revolution"
38th St. & Chicago Av. S., Mpls.
With its dark tones, Peyton's haunting take on George Floyd's now-ubiquitous selfie "speaks to the suffering and the pain of our community," he said, "generation after generation."
2. Prince's gold star
701 1st Av. N., Mpls.
Gold seemed fitting for the Minneapolis icon, whom Peyton calls "a wizard." He used 24-karat gold leaf for his stunt and laments that the club has touched it up with "cheap gold paint."
3. "Rise Up"
912 W. Lake St., Mpls.
Peyton's portrait of a Black girl, her fist in the air, became a forceful call for justice. The model, Amira, also appears in Peyton's "Northside" mural.
4. "Northside"
1840 Penn Av. N., Mpls.
His newest and most personal mural features faces familiar to North Side residents, including Houston White and his late wife, Donise (pictured inside the "N"). "I was honored and happy and sad," White said of first seeing it.
5. "Black Lives Matter"
2100 Plymouth Av. N., Mpls.
The black-and-white, beveled style of Peyton's "K" contrasted with other artists' more colorful letters in this pavement painting stretching a block down Plymouth Avenue. "His letter says: Let's remember where this started," said George Roberts of nearby Homewood Studios. "He brings a kind of elder wisdom to a project."
