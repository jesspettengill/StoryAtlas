Full text: The residents of one south Minneapolis apartment building started desperately warning one another with shouts and pounding a little before 4 a.m. Saturday as the city suffered through perhaps the worst night in its history.
"Our neighbors were banging on all the doors and screaming, 'Fire, fire, fire,' " said Catharyne Bryant, who lives with Brandon Byers in the building near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue S. and W. 35th Street.
"My reaction was get my cat and get out," she added.
Immediately next door, separated by only a few feet, a building containing O'Reilly Auto Parts and a Family Dollar store was on fire -- one of hundreds that burned as a third night of riots and unrest spread to more neighborhoods in Minnesota's largest city.
Lizz Brazen was awake and following the news when she realized the Fond du Lac building was in imminent danger. She jumped right to notifying neighbors instead of bothering to call 911, then helped organize teams of residents to wet down the apartment building with garden hoses and buckets.
"Because we knew no one was coming for us," Brazen said.
What started as demonstrations in response to the death of George Floyd after being restrained by Minneapolis police last Monday had mutated by Friday night and Saturday morning into widespread arson, looting and violence. For some, it was a night of abject terror as calls to 911 failed to deliver help.
The worst of the violence started after nightfall despite an 8 p.m. citywide curfew, even though former officer Derek Chauvin had been charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death earlier in the day. The neighborhoods around Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue became one focal point as groups of protesters converged on the Fifth Precinct Police Station.
Gov. Tim Walz, at a news conference Saturday morning, said that "the situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about George Floyd." He pinned responsibility for the worst violence and arson on what some officials believe are organized groups from outside the city looking to accelerate mayhem and lawlessness.
Facing widespread criticism for the lack of law enforcement and National Guard support, Walz said those instigating the violence were random in choosing targets and quick to adapt to changing conditions.
"When you're a force of good or law and order, you play by the rules," Walz said, promising an unprecedented mobilization of the full Minnesota National Guard in an attempt to calm the situation. "When you are bent on destruction and harm and chaos, you don't have to do that. And it makes it very, very difficult."
As the chaos ramped up, residents like Byers who found themselves adjacent to burning businesses were forced to flee homes, some with children or pets, some quickly grabbing a few vital documents or keepsakes.
"Pray for Lake Street tonight," Minneapolis Council Member Alondra Cano tweeted just before 10 p.m. Friday as she reported that a gas station at the corner of Lake Street and Park Avenue was on fire.
About 40 minutes later she tweeted: "If we don't send National Guard to Lake and Park now people are going to lose their houses to the adjacent fire."
Cano followed up later to report that firefighters finally made it to the scene and brought the flames under control. She said she'd been told National Guard soldiers had all been deployed to a different part of the city.
By Saturday, reeling and shellshocked Minneapolis residents were holding meetings in city parks and at neighborhood intersections, sharing safety tips and making new connections as they braced for what's ahead, wondering if they can count on their government for protection.
The residents of the 26-unit building at 35th and Nicollet found out early Saturday that they could not. Several saw fire trucks and police cars speed by, lights flashing, as flames leapt from the O'Reilly and Family Dollar stores.
"There's only so many emergency responders that can go around," Brazen said. She said it's too early to cast blame: "There will be time for that later. Right now we need to take care of one another."
For a time, several building residents said, the fire seemed to die down. But they believe they saw several people come back to relight it. Firefighters finally showed up about 5:30 a.m., said Elly Underwood, another resident who evacuated with her cat and a few mementos.
"They were very apologetic about not being able to get here sooner," she said.
The apartment building never caught fire -- "the wind was on our side," Underwood said -- and residents were back inside later Saturday morning. Underwood said she was deeply touched to see neighbors of all races work together to protect the building.
"Minneapolis does care about its neighbors," she said. "We are a great community, and I can't wait to move beyond this and keep living in Minneapolis. I love this city."

Full text: The Minnesota National Guard rolled through the Twin Cities on Saturday in its biggest deployment since World War II as Gov. Tim Walz sought to bring a show of strength sufficient to put an end to days of lawless rampage following the death of George Floyd.
Under criticism for failing to stop the chaos sooner, Walz all but declared war as he and other state and civic leaders begged peaceful protesters to go home before an 8 p.m. curfew Saturday to separate themselves from rioters on the streets.
But peaceful protests turned tense after curfew when crowds continued to march and officers moved toward large groups, spraying them with pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets.
The National Guard moved in aggressively against all demonstrators in the area of Nicollet and Franklin avenues, throwing tear gas bombs and effectively dispersing much of the crowd.
Police started making arrests there, as well as several blocks away at 28th and Grand Avenue "for gun violations" where an AR-15 was confiscated, Minneapolis police said.
West St. Paul Police tweeted that officers were responding to reports of shots fired and had been stopping vehicles, most with no license plates, but said later that there was no immediate threat to the public.
Efforts to take back the streets came after a fourth night of protests demanding change after the death of Floyd, an unarmed and handcuffed black man who stopped breathing after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for 8½ minutes Monday night. Bystanders captured the scene on video, which quickly went viral on the internet. Floyd was transported to a hospital, where he died.
Protests spread throughout the United States in the following days, with clashes Saturday night in more than two dozen cities, including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.
"Our cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are under assault," Walz had said, suggesting that a growing number of rioters were coming from outside the city, and possibly outside the state, in what he called "an organized attempt to destabilize civil society."
Walz authorized the National Guard to "fully activate," dramatically increasing force numbers from the 500 initially brought in to 4,100 by Saturday night. Eventually, up to 10,800 soldiers and airmen could be deployed.
Walz said he did not rule out accepting federal help in the form of troops.
Saturday night, a large crowd outside the Fifth Precinct building had remained just before the curfew. As officers stood watch from behind a reinforced fence, three women said they had no intentions of abiding by it.
"Look at them," said one who identified herself as 21-year-old Maya, but declined to give her last name as she looked at the officers. "They're not here to protect us."
When an emergency alert sounded on cellphones in Minneapolis with a message telling people to go home or to a safe location indoors, many them became agitated and began walking on 31st Street chanting "Justice! Now!"
Outside the Third Precinct building, which arsonists burned earlier in the week, two black men wearing shirts with a fist said they had driven in from Oklahoma City to participate in the backlash after seeing the video of Floyd. They identified themselves as Joe Thomas and "John Doe."
"We are not standing down," Thomas said just before 8 p.m. "I just hope they know that."
He said the protests are about more than Floyd. "We want justice for our black people, it's like constant, it's not just him. It's Eric Garner. People get killed jogging. I mean, come on."
Rick Nelson, a lifelong Minnesotan, walked the intersection of Minnehaha and Lake as dusk fell scanning for out-of-state license plates. The 29-year-old south Minneapolis resident vowed not to allow outsiders to continue destroying his neighborhood: "What's left of it anyway," said Nelson, who lives in an apartment building one block from Third Precinct headquarters.
"The point has been made. I want justice for George, too," he said. "But I'm sick of seeing it burn."
DFLer Walz has come under fire from Republicans in the Legislature calling for a more robust response. "They need to show the force, not have everything hidden behind the scenes," said Senate Minority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake. "I'm glad that they called the curfew, but when people violate the curfew you have to arrest them."
Authorities said they made about 40 arrests Friday night into Saturday morning in Minneapolis and St. Paul, mostly for burglary, curfew violations and destruction of property. Hennepin County jail logs showed detainees from Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Illinois and Alaska.
It was not clear if the outside groups suspected to be playing a part in the mayhem were made up of white supremacist agitators, left-wing anarchists, or both.
State Attorney General Keith Ellison, calling for Minnesota protesters to go home before curfew, said the agitators were destroying their message seeking changes.
"We know that the noble, just aims of the protesters are righteous and good," Ellison said. "But we also know that some evil elements are literally interfusing themselves with the protests to destroy and cause arson so that the whole community will have a low opinion of the protest. Because they're not for justice for Mr. Floyd, they're against it."
Picking up the pieces
Before the curfew Saturday, thousands of people spent a crisp, sunny morning and afternoon with brooms, shovels, buckets and garbage bags on Minneapolis' Lake Street, where much of the damage was inflicted the night before.
Shayna Lawson, of Minneapolis, was at the scene of the burned down Minnehaha Lake Wine and Spirits and had been at the scene of Floyd's detainment earlier. She said she wanted to pay her respects.
"We're hoping that we can help clean up the neighborhood," she said. "Clean up our communities and build everything stronger than it was before."
People brought bags and shopping carts full of groceries and other supplies to various spots in the city, an offering of help for local residents after nearby stores had been looted and burned.
Thousands also gathered in mostly peaceful daytime demonstrations.
An estimated 6,000 gathered outside the Fifth Precinct police station at 31st Street and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, where demonstrators chanted "Arrest all four," referring to the other three officers who were fired from their jobs after helping detain Floyd, but who have not been arrested or charged with a crime.
Protests spilled over to the south Minneapolis home of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.
More than 1,000 people gathered outside, spilling over onto his front lawn, flower garden and entry steps. From the street, one black speaker after another grabbed a microphone and described incidents of unprosecuted police violence against their relatives. With fists raised, the crowd chanted, "Mike must go!" and "Charge all killer cops!" Some younger protesters draped rolls of red toilet paper over a tree.
The words, "Justice for George" were scrawled in chalk on Freeman's front doorsteps. "Black Lives Matter" signs were placed on his front windows.
More than a dozen mothers of black men described police violence as the chanted their sons' names and screamed, "Not one more."
"If it weren't for George Floyd, no one would be listening to us," said Amity Dimock, who said her 21-year-old son was a victim of police violence.
As the crowd disbanded about 6 p.m., protesters ripped plants from Freeman's front yard and broke one of his basement windows.

Full text: They came from all walks of life and many beliefs.
They were reverends and rabbis and people of the Islamic faith. They spoke in Somali, Spanish and English. And they pleaded, at times through tears, for their hurting communities to stay home Saturday night to prevent more pain.
Called together by Gov. Tim Walz, a group of Minnesota community leaders spent nearly two televised hours Saturday morning acknowledging the outrage over the death of George Floyd. In so doing, they also urged people to abide by an 8 p.m. curfew in place across a large swath of the Twin Cities to help put an end to the riots that have traumatized residents.
They decried the presence of rioters from outside the metro area who, under the cloak of darkness, used peaceful protesters as "human shields" to loot and torch drugstores, a post office, auto parts shops and gas stations, and to fire shots at law enforcement officers.
"White people from other communities are coming into my community, our communities as some kind of perverse poetry, as if it wasn't bad enough already," said Justin Terrell, executive director of the Council for Minnesotans of African Heritage.
"Go home now. The fascists on the plane right now, turn around."
Clarence Castile knows how hard it is to ask people to stay home and not take to the streets. His nephew, Philando Castile, was shot seven times by an officer in Falcon Heights in 2016 after insisting during a traffic stop that he wasn't reaching for a gun.
"Riots and protests are needed sometimes so that our state authorities, communities know what we're trying to say," Castile said Saturday. "Those victims who lose their lives because somebody doesn't hear them, it has to be said by someone else in a different way, a stronger and more powerful way."
Yet as Castile drove into work Friday, he saw a plume of black smoke from a burning building rising beyond the highway in south Minneapolis. And it terrified him.
"That's something I've never seen and something I never want to see again," he said. "We have to rebuild our community now."
What started as peaceful protests early last week devolved Thursday and Friday into riots throughout the Twin Cities, bringing destruction to many neighborhoods.
At the news conference Saturday, Walz and state public safety leaders said they were overwhelmed by the number of people who broke the curfew Friday, spreading out across Minneapolis and St. Paul and causing more chaos than law enforcement could handle.
Many of those individuals were encouraged to come to the Twin Cities by national groups across the country, Walz said, capitalizing on the region's discontent to fuel the anarchy.
"The situation in Minneapolis is no longer in any way about the murder of George Floyd," Walz said.
Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Navigate MN, said she was devastated when she saw the wreckage on Minneapolis's Lake Street, the "heart of the Latino community" and a hub for many immigrant-owned businesses that now are in ruins.
She said she was encouraged to later see people flood to the neighborhood to help clean up.
"Black, brown, Indigenous, Somali, Mexican, Salvadorans, taking care of the little legacies and the little businesses that are the lifelines in our communities," she said. "But I also saw another story, folks nobody would recognize as our neighbors," who came to "cause more harm and pain in places where there's already harm and pain."
For Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, watching Native American nonprofit MIGIZI in south Minneapolis burn down was particularly painful.
Before she was elected to office, Flanagan was a community organizer for more than two decades, marching in the streets after any fatal police encounter.
"My heart and guts are ripped out right now," she said, because she can't be on streets with her community, mourning at the scene where Floyd pleaded with police for his life.
"That space on 38th and Chicago is sacred ground, and people should be able to come together on that sacred ground and mourn and grieve and demand change and justice," Flanagan said.
"In this moment, we cannot, because there are detractors. There are white supremacists. There are anarchists. There are people who are burning down the institutions that are core to our identity and who we are."
Compounding the situation is the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1,000 Minnesotans, shuttered businesses and left people emotionally drained, said Mary Merrill of Sabathani Community Center.
"Here we are in a pandemic that we have been dealing with the last three, four months, then on top of that the old disease of racism and hatred reared its ugly head one more time," she said.
Despite that, she pleaded with Minnesotans to stay home, a decision that would help law enforcement separate peaceful protesters from rioters and return the focus to Floyd's memory and the effort to seek justice.
"We're not going to let others come in and change the agenda we've been fighting now for 400 years," she said.

In Minnesota, the conviction of a cop is rare

Full text: The 2019 conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter is believed to be the first time in state history that a police officer was convicted of murder for an on-duty killing.
On Friday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced filing the same charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd.
In doing so, Freeman once again finds himself in the glare of the national spotlight as he attempts to succeed a second time at what has been an exceedingly rare result in Minnesota and across the country -- convincing a jury to convict a police officer of murder.
Despite what the now-viral video shows -- a seemingly nonchalant Chauvin's knee pressing the neck of a clearly distressed Floyd for nearly nine minutes -- local legal experts say convictions are far from ensured in cases where cops are charged with murder. Even when much of the public is convinced police were in the wrong, police officers have won acquittal.
From Freddie Gray's 2015 death in Baltimore while in police custody to the 2016 shooting death of Philando Castile during a Falcon Heights traffic stop, cases that seem open and shut often are not.
In part, it's because state law gives police wide latitude in using deadly force if they fear they or others will be seriously injured or killed.
While that seems unlikely from the video of Chauvin restraining Floyd, former Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner said the fact remains that prosecutors must be painstakingly thorough.
"These cases are way more complicated and the burden on the prosecution is higher than I think the public understands," she said.
Thomas Heffelfinger, former U.S. attorney for Minnesota, agrees.
"It's not a slam dunk and these cases never are," Heffelfinger said. "These cases are hard to prove and we have to make sure we do it correctly."
Obtaining a murder conviction is not the only challenge Freeman faces.
Demands are growing louder for charges to be brought against the other three police officers who assisted Chauvin in restraining Floyd on Memorial Day. And the longtime prosecutor's relationship with the local black community continues to be strained.
In 2016, Freeman announced he was eliminating the long-standing and secret use of a grand jury in police-involved shootings after the November 2015 death of Jamar Clark. Activists praised the decision, only to make him the target of derision after he announced that he wouldn't charge the officers involved.
He faced a similar backlash in July 2018 when he declined to prosecute the officers involved in the shooting of Thurman Blevins, a decision made just one month after the shooting. And when Noor shot and killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond after he responded to her 911 call in 2017, some activists noted that it only occurred when the officer was black and the victim a white woman.
Freeman also drew controversy in the case when he was caught on tape telling activists before Noor's charging that he didn't have the evidence to do so because investigators "haven't done their job" and that a charge would be "the big present I'd like to see under the Christmas tree."
On Thursday, the county attorney was criticized after he said: "It's a violation of my ethics to talk about and evaluate evidence before a charging decision and I will not do that. I will say this: that that video is graphic and horrific and terrible and no person should do that. But my job in the end is to prove that [Chauvin] violated criminal statute."
Freeman later issued a statement "that it is critical to review all the evidence because at the time of trial, invariably, all that information will be used."
A group of local activists on Friday launched a campaign to remove Freeman from office, saying Freeman's statements Thursday "will make securing a criminal conviction against Derek Chauvin more difficult." The recall group said Freeman "has mishandled the murder of George Floyd" and that "this is not the first time that Mike Freeman has protected killer cops and stood in the way of justice for unarmed Black men. We cannot let him continue to use his office to protect police who abuse and murder Black and Brown folks in our city."
Even the charges Freeman chose to file against Chauvin -- the same that were used to convict Noor -- were criticized by local experts as understating the severity of the crime. In separate interviews Friday, local attorneys Joe Friedberg and Christopher Madel called Freeman's decisionmaking in the case "inexplicable."
"This doesn't make any sense. It doesn't fit this," Friedberg said of the charge of third-degree murder.
"That charge is more appropriate for someone doing something deadly, without a particular person in mind."
He added: "They have put themselves in a position here where any intelligent judge would dismiss this case."
Madel, a former trial attorney with the U.S. Justice Department who has represented clients in several high-profile cases, said the video of the incident appears to make a charge of second-degree murder more appropriate.
In the video, Chauvin appears to repeatedly ignore Floyd's cries that he can't breathe, despite witnesses pleading with him to stop.
"Multiple witnesses can be heard telling [Chauvin] 'I think you're killing him.' " Madel said. "And he just sits there with his hands in his pockets."
Despite the criticisms and challenges, Freeman on Friday appeared undaunted.
He touted the speed in which the charges against Chauvin were filed -- less than four days from Floyd's death -- as the fastest his office has ever brought charges against a police officer.
"This case has moved with extraordinary speed," Freeman said. "We have charged this case as quickly as admissible evidence has been collected and presented to us. We have now been able to put together the evidence that we need,"
And, for now at least, he said the third-degree murder charge is most appropriate. Freeman acknowledged the road ahead might be difficult.
The burden of proof makes it difficult to convict a police officer of murder. But, he reminded people Friday, his office has done it before.
And he seemed confident it would again, saying: "We have a very veteran prosecutor group, aided by a very veteran investigator group at the BCA [Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension]."

Full text: This is what it feels like when the Twin Cities -- when our cities -- go up in flames: The air is noxious and gritty after days of fires. Bits of dirt and dust, of smoke and debris, float down into your eyes. The closer you get to the destruction, the more the smell clings to you, a combination of sulfur and spent fireworks and -- if near the St. Paul NAPA Auto Parts store that by Friday was a smoldering heap of twisted metal -- a skunky chemical odor.
There are no buses, with mass transit suspended at least through Sunday. Spray-painted signs are ubiquitous: "JAIL KILLER COPS," "WE WANT COPS IN CUFFS," "PLEASE DONT BURN KIDS LIVE UPSTAIRS." As if marked by Passover blood, business owners signal why looters or arsonists should spare their storefronts: "SMALL BUSINESS," reads one Japanese restaurant in Lyn-Lake. "MINORITY OWNED," says a convenience store on Eat Street. "BLACK OWNED! WE'RE TITHERS!," at a hair salon on East Lake Street.
Across the Twin Cities, from the areas far removed from this week's protests to the areas most devastated by this week's destruction, the physical and psychic toll of these erupting emotions in the daytime and these lawless horrors at night bear a heavy weight.
It is a city under siege.
It is a city filled with anger and sadness and fear and, yes, love, love that comes out during the daytime after destruction reigns at night.
The looted Target near the abandoned Third Precinct station still has a cheerful sign -- "We're hiring, starting at $13.00/hr" -- but now Minnesota National Guard troops bisect E. Lake Street to keep people away from the protests' destructive epicenter. Disaster tourists taking selfies near stone-faced soldiers mingle with hundreds of volunteers, armed with just brooms and dustpans, sweeping up broken glass.
On Lake Street, a skeleton of a brick building smoldered near a couple of National Guard Humvees. Da'Ray Sherow of St. Paul reflects on the ruins with ambivalence. These disturbances -- protests, looting, riots, whatever you want to call them -- had led to the arrest of police officer Derek Chauvin, Sherow believes. But that doesn't mean all this anarchy is justified.
"It's pain coming out. It's not logical," says Sherow, who is black. "My heart goes out to the people who lost property and the people who don't have access to food and the people who have to rebuild this community."
A ladder truck douses an apartment fire above a Foot Locker Friday afternoon. The smoke drifts toward Midtown Global Market, an international food and craft bazaar in what had been a vacant Sears building -- a testament to the progressive international city that Minneapolis aspires to be. By Saturday morning, evidence of unrest has kept spreading, even as normalcy keeps popping up amid the chaos: People mowing lawns, going for bike rides, drinking coffee on their porch.
The Twin Cities seem to have two faces: One when the sun is up, a face of good and of kindness, of powerful protests against George Floyd's death and of thousands of volunteers working to clean up their city. A more menacing face comes after nightfall, when looting and arson and riots -- a vast majority, said Gov. Tim Walz, sparked by people from out of state -- bear little resemblance to the meaningful, powerful protests of just hours before.
Chris McPherson works for the owner of a strip mall south of Lake Street. On Saturday morning, the parking lot is full of volunteers cleaning up debris, and McPherson appears dazed by it all.
"The bakery right there, that's a [Hispanic] family. They've been running this business for years. And it's just ruined them," McPherson said. "The same with the Chinese restaurant -- it's a mom-and-pop. The laundromat, mom-and-pop. It's just unbelievable."
Nearby stands Camilo Ramos, owner of Sol Travel on Lake Street, which he started about 20 years ago. The check cashing and money transfer business, which caters to the local immigrant community, is in disarray. His storefront has been looted three times this week. He cleaned it up and boarded the business Friday. He arrived Saturday to find looters had returned and lit a fire, which set off a sprinkler system. He is holding off cleaning up the latest mess, unsure what the next night would bring.
"I'm very sad this week," he says.
It is not lost on Twin Cities history buffs the sad irony of where has seen the brunt of the looting and arsons and riots. E. Lake Street is perhaps the city's most vibrant immigrant business corridor, recently designated by the city as a cultural district and this week called "a precious jewel of our state" by state Attorney General Keith Ellison. The University Avenue corridor in the Midway neighborhood is St. Paul's equivalent: A bit less small business-y, a bit more strip mall-y, but with the same flavor of aspirational immigrant- and minority-owned businesses lifting themselves up.
On University Avenue, volunteers bag up broken glass, black soot and debris. At the ransacked and torched Sports Dome, the only things left after the roof collapsed are bricks and twisted metal bars.
"I'm really hurt because this our hood, this our city," says Latimah Abdullah, who is cleaning up with her son, Massiah. "That police officer should be in jail, because if it was a black man that black man would be in jail right now. So I feel the pain, I feel the hurt. But at the end of the day it didn't have to be like this."
At the Laundry Place on University Avenue, building manager Jim O'Meara nails boards to windows. He is angry: Angry about George Floyd's death, angry at looters and arsonists whose destruction bears little resemblance to the ideals of the protests. The night before, looters broke into the laundromat, busted up the ATM and tried to light fires. A neighbor chased them off.
In the morning, though, O'Meara manages to see some goodness.
"The first we saw this morning after all the questionable people left were ladies and men with brooms and dustpans, people coming through that were cleaning the streets," he says. "Never seen anything like that before. Ever."
A woman is passing out homemade cookies. Boxes of Diet Cokes and Sprites sit outside Magic Noodle restaurant, and a sign: "FREE For All Angels." A man with a rifle slung over his shoulder and a pistol strapped to his waist walks past: "I kicked them out a million times last night!" the man shouts to O'Meara. "They almost burned it twice."
The man's name is Mahar Safy. His family owns Midway Tobacco and Vapor in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood plus seven more shops around the Twin Cities. On Thursday night, after their insurance company said rioting wasn't covered, he and 10 family members spent all night patrolling the store. Every few minutes, one circled the building, shooing people away. "Come and shoot me!" one rioter yelled at him. But Safy didn't shoot, and they all went away, and his was one of the few untouched businesses in the neighborhood.
Safy has been through this before. He is a Palestinian from the West Bank. This week's riots in Minnesota were not his first riots. But he never imagined -- having moved to America more than two decades ago -- that he'd be emptying his stores of inventory and risking his life to protect the family business.
"It was up to us to take control," Safy says. "If we weren't here, this building would have been burned for sure."
Early Saturday morning, St. Paul was more quiet than the night before, but Safy heard one of their stores on Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis was being broken into. Several armed family members headed over there. They stayed for the night and patrolled the whole strip mall, sparing it from the nearby violence.
And on the drive between the two cities, between Minneapolis' epicenter of the chaos and St. Paul's, you see an American flag at a gas station. The flag is at half staff. It feels entirely appropriate, and for every reason.

Youth in need of mentors to cope

Full text: Larry McKenzie called to check on his players this week. The Minneapolis North boys' basketball coach has been in frequent contact throughout the pandemic, but this call was different. He wanted to see how his players were doing emotionally with the heartbreaking events unfolding in Minneapolis.
What he heard concerned him when talking about the death of George Floyd after a white police officer kneeled on Floyd's neck on a city street. Nothing new and nothing changes, a few players told him.
"That's what I'm bothered about," McKenzie said midweek before officer Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder Friday following two volatile days. "When we get to the point where we feel like there's absolutely nothing within our power to do anything about it, we've lost. We cannot get to the point where because it happens so often that this is just another day. This can't be just another day."
McKenzie scheduled a Zoom meeting for Thursday with his players to talk with a sports psychologist. He wants to help teenagers navigate their emotions during a traumatic time. The veteran coach recalled his former players bottling up following the Jamar Clark shooting five years ago.
"I remember I could look through my kids' eyes and I could see the pain, but there was no emotion," he said. "That's how I feel right now. I'm back in that space again."
Emotion poured out of McKenzie in a phone conversation this week. He's hurting, like so many here. He keeps replaying the video of Floyd in his mind.
"I'm traumatized," he said. "Literally in my head, I'm hearing George Floyd saying, 'Momma, Momma.' That could've been me. That could've been my son. That could've been any of my players."
Young people have been on my mind a lot this week. Imagine being a black kid in Minneapolis and trying to make sense of their reality right now. It's beyond comprehension as a middle-age white man to understand the depths of what they have been subjected to with this tragedy and their city being torn apart and smoldering.
"They're scared and confused," said Christina Saunders, executive director of ACES4Kids, an after-school educational program for kids from Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Kids need coaches and mentors now more than ever, along with their support network at home. People they trust and make them feel safe. People like McKenzie, a coaching legend who has been a father figure to Minneapolis youth. People like teachers at ACES who strive to help kids in grades 4-8 close the achievement gap in math and social-emotional learning through a sports lens.
Math wasn't the only curriculum at ACES this week. Discussions focused on Floyd and the community's reaction.
"We try to be careful because we don't want to overstep," Saunders said, "but we also understand that there are deeper issues that have led to this that we want to talk about with them."
ACES held its annual all-star gala Thursday night -- virtually -- as protests took place in both cities. Every Twin Cities pro sports organization along with the Gophers athletic department has a relationship with ACES. Thursday's event included a video with testimonials of support from various sports figures in town, including Rocco Baldelli, Matt Dumba and Derek Falvey. That relationship has a real impact on those kids.
McKenzie planned to stress education on his Zoom call with players so that they someday can have "an entree into the rooms where decisions are made." Change demands that, he says.
McKenzie, 63, grew up in the South before moving to Minneapolis in 1981. He remembers the riots of 1968 and other race relations flash points. He describes himself as an "eternal optimist" and believes the Twin Cities will recover from this painful experience.
"Is it going to be easy? Absolutely not," he said.
The coach challenged everyone to take part in the healing.
"We've got to get away from black and white. It's wrong and right," he said. "That's the only way we're going to change."

Murder charge for ex-cop: PROTESTERS FLOOD MPLS. STREETS, DEFY CURFEWS ; Cities, state faulted for Thursday night's widespread mayhem

Full text: Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on Friday announced murder and manslaughter charges that accuse a fired Minneapolis police officer of killing George Floyd -- an act caught on video and seen around the world, sparking days of violent demonstrations across the Twin Cities.
Derek Chauvin, 44, was arrested late Friday morning and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter four days after he pinned his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes Monday at the intersection of E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue as the unarmed and handcuffed man told him he couldn't breathe. Chauvin is being held in the Ramsey County jail on $500,000 bail. Authorities have not explained why he was booked in a jail other than in the county where he was charged.
He is the first white officer in Minnesota to be criminally prosecuted in the death of a black civilian. The maximum sentence for third-degree murder is 25 years; the maximum for second-degree manslaughter is 10 years.
Bystanders begged Chauvin and three other officers at the scene to relent, but their calls went unheeded as the 46-year-old Floyd grew unresponsive and later died.
The three other officers involved in Floyd's curbside detention were also fired, but they have not been arrested or charged. Freeman said he anticipates the other officers will be prosecuted, but he declined to speculate on the counts or when they would
be filed.
Freeman explained that Chauvin was the first of the four charged because "we felt it was important to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator. I must say this case has moved with extraordinary speed."
The criminal complaint, citing the autopsy, said that Floyd did not die from strangulation but a combination of being restrained along with various underlying medical conditions including heart disease and hypertension.
Chauvin's attorney, Tom Kelly, declined to comment about the allegations against his client, who remains jailed with his first court appearance yet to be scheduled. Minneapolis Police Officers Federation President Lt. Bob Kroll did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Asked whether two nights of protest that destroyed dozens of buildings in Minneapolis and St. Paul factored into his charging decision, Freeman said the move was based on evidence, which includes video, witness statements, a preliminary medical examiner's report and discussions with an expert.
Freeman had said at a news conference Thursday that such investigations take time, and he called for patience. He said his office has been flooded with as many as 1,000 calls a day and countless e-mails demanding charges.
"But my job in the end is to prove that he violated criminal statute," he said. "And there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge. We need to wade through all of that evidence to come to a meaningful determination."
Freeman later issued a statement clarifying "that it is critical to review all the evidence because at the time of trial, invariably, all that information will be used."
Asked Friday what had changed to clear the way for charges, the county attorney said evidence his office received as late as Thursday afternoon played a role. He declined to elaborate.
Disclosure of Chauvin's arrest before the charges were filed came from state Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington during a news conference, where he called Floyd's death at the hands of police a "murder. … That's what it looked like to me."
According to the criminal complaint: Police were called after Floyd was suspected of passing a fake $20 bill at the Cup Foods store. Officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng approached Floyd, who was in a car with two other people.
Lane pointed his gun at Floyd, who placed his hands on the steering wheel. Lane returned his gun to the holster and pulled him out of the car. Floyd initially resisted being handcuffed, but once cuffed was compliant. When they tried to put Floyd in the squad car, he stiffened and fell to the ground and said he was claustrophobic.
Chauvin then arrived with his partner, Tou Thao, and the four officers struggled to place Floyd in the squad car. Chauvin then pulled Floyd out of the vehicle, and the 6-foot-6 Floyd again went to the ground while still handcuffed, the complaint read.
As two officers held Floyd's back and legs, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck, the charges continued.
Floyd then began repeating "I can't breathe" along with "Mama" and "please," the charges read. One or more of the officers said to Floyd, "You are talking fine" as he continued moving back and forth.
None of the three officers moved from their positions, according to the complaint. Lane asked whether they should roll Floyd on his side.
"No, staying put where we got him," Chauvin allegedly replied.
"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever," Lane said.
"That's why we have him on his stomach," Chauvin said.
The three officers continued to hold Floyd down.
"Excited delirium" is a controversial condition, often related to drug use, that can allegedly lead to violence or physical agitation.
Thao can be seen in the video standing watch as Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck. Thao also rebuffed bystanders who begged the officers to relent and to check Floyd's pulse after he went limp.
Paramedics and emergency room staff at HCMC worked for nearly an hour to revive Floyd, who arrived with no pulse. He was pronounced dead about 9:25 p.m.
Freeman declined to say whether any of the former officers have given a statement to investigators.
An attorney representing Floyd's family called the arrest and charging of Chauvin "a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice."
Benjamin Crump's statement went on to say he and Floyd's survivors expected a more serious charge and the arrests of the other officers.
"We call on authorities to revise the charges [against Chauvin] to reflect the culpability of this officer," the statement continued. "We fully expect to see the other officers who did nothing to protect the life of George Floyd to be arrested and charged soon."
The swiftness of the charges came as activists, politicians and the public had been calling for arrests and prosecution of the former officers all week while large sections of Minneapolis and St. Paul were thrust into sometimes violent protests that devolved into looting, arson, theft and property damage.
Activists and community members have long complained that suspects are often arrested as soon as the same day of a death and charged within 24 hours, a sentiment echoed by the Rev. Al Sharpton on Thursday afternoon when the national civil rights activist visited the site of Floyd's detention.
Mayor Jacob Frey released a statement after Chauvin was charged that said "what's happened in Minneapolis is bigger than any one city and any single event. For our black community who have, for centuries, been forced to endure injustice in a world simply unwilling to correct or acknowledge it: I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with skepticism and a righteous outrage."
U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, along with 26 colleagues, called on the Department of Justice "to investigate the patterns and practices of racially discriminatory and violent policing in the Minneapolis Police Department."We must work toward justice for the community, which means ensuring that the MPD accounts for and eliminates any unconstitutional police practices."

Chauvin in custody; other officers lie low

Full text: As the Twin Cities enter an anxious and uncertain weekend, fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is in custody and accused of murder, while the three other ex-officers present at George Floyd's fatal arrest are keeping an extremely low profile.
Tou Thao, videotaped watching as Chauvin continued to press on Floyd's neck with his knee, has left Minnesota, his lawyer confirmed Friday. Criminal defense attorney Robert Paule said Thao is "safely elsewhere" and that he couldn't comment further.
J Alexander Kueng, one of the two first officers at the scene who helped pin Floyd down, is believed to be staying with family in Minneapolis. Thomas K. Lane has left and didn't tell anyone where he was going, a relative said Friday.
Protests continued to erupt across the Twin Cities after Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced murder and manslaughter charges against Chauvin and said he anticipated charges against Thao, Kueng and Lane but declined to speculate what they would be.
With social media pages scrubbed, phones turned off or disconnected, and people now fearing violence, details on the men are getting hard to come by.
Chauvin, the man at the center of the crisis, has homes in Oakdale and Windermere, Fla. Both Chauvin, 44, and his wife, Kellie, have worked in real estate. Kellie Chauvin holds an active real estate license and has worked at ReMax Results in Woodbury. Derek Chauvin, too, has a real estate license, records show, listing an Apple Valley business address with Realty Group. The license is currently inactive. Realty Group spokeswoman Stacy Bettison said Chauvin worked as an independent contractor there for about six months in late 2018 and early 2019.
He worked uniformed off-duty security for years at El Nuevo Rodeo, a large E. Lake Street dance club in Minneapolis. A block from the Third Precinct, it's the neighborhood that has experienced some of the heaviest rioting.
According to the former owner Maya Santamaria, Chauvin worked the club most weekends for about 16 years and "really became my main guy here."
For about a year, George Floyd also worked security at the club, but she said she doesn't think Floyd and Chauvin crossed paths.
She and Chauvin were friends, she said. But customers did complain about him, she said. Chauvin was quick to get hard core, Santamaria said, and was uneasy with the crowds on "Twerk Fest Tuesdays" when the club catered to more black patrons.
"I've seen him in action and I've seen him lose it and I've called him out on it before," she said. "I've told him it's unnecessary and unjustified some of the ways that he behaves. He just loses it."
Chauvin's work history at the Minneapolis Police Department includes more than 15 conduct complaints over his 19 years with the department.
Almost all the complaints were closed without discipline, police internal affairs records show, suggesting the allegations weren't sustained. The nature of the complaints wasn't made public.
In 2011, he was among the officers at the scene when Minneapolis officer Terry Nutter shot and wounded Leroy Martinez near the Little Earth community. According to police, Nutter fired after Martinez, suspected in a different shooting, raised his gun and wouldn't drop it. Martinez recovered and was charged in the earlier shooting.
In 2008, Chauvin shot and wounded Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic assault call. When Chauvin and his partner arrived at the south Minneapolis apartment, Toles holed up in the bathroom. Chauvin forced his way in and during a struggle Toles allegedly grabbed for Chauvin's gun and Chauvin fired, hitting him in the abdomen.
In 2006, Chauvin and five other officers responded to a 911 call about a stabbing in south Minneapolis. The suspect, Wayne Reyes, tried to drive away in his truck, then pulled over. Police said he got out and swung the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun toward them, and several officers fired shots, killing Reyes.
Lane's relative, who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation, cried as he described Lane and how he feels he has been misrepresented. Lane, who is detailed in charges as pointing a gun at Floyd before handcuffing him, later asked whether the officers should roll Floyd on his side as he was restrained.
"We're devastated," the relative of Lane said. "Our whole family feels terrible. This isn't him. This isn't what he worked all his life for."
He described Lane, a 37-year-old Twin Cities native, as a "compassionate and amusing and insightful" person. He got married in 2018, and was excited about continuing the family legacy in law enforcement, he said. Lane's grandfather Donald M. Mealey was a Minneapolis police detective who died in 2008 at 92. Other relatives, too, worked for the Minneapolis police, he said. He called Lane "a legacy officer" who received his law enforcement license last August.
"He doesn't have a bad bone in his body," he said of Lane. "This is just a terrible event and I feel bad for the lives lost and the Floyd family."
"Not all cops are bad," he added. "[He] is being categorized now and he shouldn't be."
Like Lane, J Alexander Kueng, 26, was also just licensed last August. Neither Lane nor Kueng was the subject of any conduct complaints, Minneapolis police records show.
Reached by phone, a local relative of Kueng's said: "There's no way to comment, so don't start."
Thao, 34, had six unspecified police conduct complaints filed against him, records show. Five were closed without discipline, but one was open at the time of his firing.
Thao, along with another officer, was also the subject of a 2017 police brutality lawsuit. Lamar Ferguson alleged that in 2014 the two officers told him they were serving a warrant for his arrest, then beat him, breaking his teeth, while he was handcuffed. The city of Minneapolis paid $25,000 to settle the civil rights case.

Full text: A day after one of the most destructive and violent nights in Minneapolis history, Gov. Tim Walz and the mayors of the state's two largest cities faced mounting criticism, with the governor calling the city's response an "abject failure."
As Walz vowed to restore order heading into the weekend, he acknowledged shortcomings in the response to protests late Thursday night and early Friday, which led to the evacuation and destruction of the city's Third Precinct headquarters, as well as widespread looting and arson fires that set the city ablaze.
Walz activated the National Guard on Thursday at the request of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to aid in response to the protests over the death of George Floyd, who died after being forcibly restrained by police. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter also requested assistance. Minnesota National Guard Adjutant General Jon Jensen said cities typically give direction on what is needed from the guard -- but that direction never came.
"We sort of knew what we might be doing as it related to civil disturbance in Minneapolis, but it's very important we know exactly what we're being asked to do so we have the right equipment, we mobilize the right number of soldiers," Jensen said. "That element was lacking."
In an interview Friday afternoon, Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said their police officers were "overwhelmed" with protests and violence, not just at the Third Precinct building on Lake Street but also across the city.
"We have never in my 30 years experienced multiple events of high-risk civil unrest, that included mass looting, indiscriminate arson with sounds of … gunshots, direct violence in confrontations with police, and all of these happening throughout our entire city," Arradondo said. "These events over the last 72 hours absolutely overwhelmed our public safety response."
As one example, Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel said he was unaware the Third Precinct building was on fire until he was told so by CNN host Don Lemon on Thursday night. Fruetel could not be reached for comment Friday.
Both Frey and Walz acknowledged that discussions took place earlier in the day about potentially evacuating the Third Precinct building, but ultimately Frey made the final call after discussions with the police chief. Arradondo said he became "gravely concerned" for his officers when protesters breached the building and entered inside.
Frey said the city and state need unity: "Going back and forth in a time of crisis does no good."
St. Paul City Council President Amy Brendmoen echoed that sentiment, saying it's "easy to look backward and be critical." She called it "an overwhelming and unprecedented situation, and we need to be working in partnership with all of our levels of government."
State and city officials faced criticism over the lack of a visible police and National Guard presence Thursday night as dozens of buildings in both cities were burned or looted. Few arrests were made.
"Above all else, this is a failure in leadership, and that leadership rests on Gov. Walz's shoulders. The governor cannot blame the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul," said GOP Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka. He said Walz should have called in the National Guard right away and a couple of thousand guard members should have been activated, instead of hundreds. Gazelka also said he believes there needs to be more proactive arrests of people committing crimes, and a curfew should have been in place by Thursday.
Walz said that Thursday night he was following a process of waiting for Minneapolis leaders to request assistance before sending in the National Guard. "We were staying in the lane that we were asked to support this," he said. But after watching the situation deteriorate around the Third Precinct, he said the decision was made shortly after midnight to move in. Soldiers arrived around 3:45 a.m. -- by which time it had long been on fire.
Gazelka said Walz should not be asking others for a plan. "It was obvious that the Minneapolis mayor was in over his head. And I think that's where the governor needed to respond with emergency powers and commander-in-chief over our National Guard -- the National Guard was simply waiting for a plan of action," Gazelka said.
Minnesota House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, raised concerns about the coming weekend. "There has been a disturbing lack of leadership and clear plan on how we're going to prevent further chaos with the weekend approaching," he said in a statement. "City and state leaders knew that there would be more looting and riots last night, but took no visible steps to prevent the destruction."
President Donald Trump, who spoke with Walz Thursday night, weighed in on the rioting later, singling out Frey for a "total lack of leadership" and saying he would send in the federal troops to "get the job done right."
Walz called Trump's remarks -- including a tweet that said "When the looting starts, the shooting starts" -- "unhelpful." He called for balancing the outrage over the violent protests with an understanding of the despair and lack of trust that led to them.
"What the world has witnessed since the killing of George Floyd on Monday has been a visceral pain, a community trying to understand who we are and where we go from here," he said. "We have to restore order to our society before we can start addressing the issues, before we turn back to where we should be spending our energy: making sure justice is served."
Adding to the sense of confusion, Walz was forced to intervene early Friday in the State Patrol arrest of a CNN crew trying to cover the protests on Lake Street in Minneapolis. Walz publicly apologized to CNN President Jeff Zucker and the news media for the detention of the journalists, which was captured on live television.
Several arrests were made for arson and burglary, but it was only the arrest of the journalists that was broadcast to the public. "I take full responsibility," Walz said, calling the episode "inexcusable.
Asked by reporters if he bore responsibility in the broader outcome of the protests, Walz said: "If the issue was that the state should have moved faster, that is on me."
Walz promised a more coordinated law enforcement response led by the state heading into the weekend, when more protests are planned. He also declared a temporary curfew from 8 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday and again starting Saturday into Sunday.
Officials hoped that murder and manslaughter charges brought Friday against Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in connection with Floyd's death might help calm tensions. Just hours before the arrest and charges, Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington called Floyd's death a "murder."
"I don't want to prejudice this from a criminal perspective, but I'm just calling it like I see it at that point," he said.

Protests, chaos, looting and grief

Full text: The Twin Cities convulsed with chaos for a third straight night of violent unrest Thursday in the wake of the Memorial Day death of George Floyd while being restrained on the neck by a Minneapolis police officer, another painful chapter in America's -- and Minnesota's -- long reckoning with law enforcement killings of unarmed black men.
Framed by grief and rage over Floyd's death as well as uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic, the day and night came in tense waves: Buildings burned. The police chief apologized. Prayer circles formed at the site of Floyd's killing. Business owners boarded up windows. Post offices closed. And then, as evening fell, there were widespread peaceful protests -- but also more clashes with police and more fires.
Gov. Tim Walz called in reinforcements -- the first time the Minnesota National Guard has been activated for a civil disturbance in 34 years.
Meanwhile, county and federal prosecutors expressed disgust at Floyd's killing while pleading for the public's patience as they conduct an investigation and mull whether to charge Derek Chauvin, the police officer whose knee was pressed to Floyd's neck as he died, or the other three officers present. The Hennepin County medical examiner mirrored that call for patience, saying an autopsy to determine a cause and manner for Floyd's death cannot be rushed -- even as protesters demanded that Chauvin swiftly be charged with murder.
"I will not rush justice," said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. "We have to do this right. We have to prove this in a court of law. … Please: Give me and give the United States attorney the time to do this right, and we will bring you justice -- I promise."
All over the Twin Cities, however, patience felt in short supply.
Floyd's killing quickly has turned into an international story, with a White House spokeswoman calling the death "absolutely tragic" and noting the attorney general was briefing President Donald Trump.
In the Twin Cities, Thursday felt like a continued push and pull between city and state authorities pleading for calm and protesters fed up with the systemic racism they believe Floyd's killing represents.
As Thursday's sun rose on an idyllic late-May day in the Twin Cities, buildings still smoldered from fires lit during violent protests the night before. Near the corner of E. Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue -- across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct headquarters, the protests' epicenter -- a Wendy's restaurant was gone. So was a six-story affordable-housing apartment building in the middle of construction.
A burned-out AutoZone store was a husk of its former self. It felt more like a war zone than a busy commercial center. By night's end, hundreds of buildings and businesses were damaged across the metro, and protesters overtook the Third Precinct headquarters as police evacuated.
Earlier in the day, glimmers of hope appeared. Scores of community members showed up in the Lake Street Target parking lot for a massive cleanup. Forces of restoration took over the spot where rioters had encamped hours before. National civil rights leaders appeared at protests: Jesse Jackson sported a sign saying, "Cowards kill the unarmed," while Al Sharpton met with local leaders and protesters. Artists painted a mural of Floyd's smiling face outside the Cup Foods grocery store on Chicago Avenue where he was killed.
At a late-morning news conference, Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins strode up to a podium, removed her face mask and sang part of "Amazing Grace," echoing former President Barack Obama singing the hymn after the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, S.C.
"We feel," she said, referring to the black community in Minneapolis and nationwide, "as if there was a knee on all of our collective necks -- a knee that says, 'Black life does not matter to the institutions that dictate what happens in this culture and society.' … Until we name this virus, this disease that has infected America for the past 400 years, we will never, ever resolve this issue."
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a local emergency, which runs until Sunday evening but can be extended by the City Council. The declaration gives him the ability to declare a curfew -- he hadn't as of Thursday evening -- and is designed to make it easier to ask for help from other government agencies.
St. Paul, too, erupts
But by afternoon, rioting and looting had spread across the Mississippi River to St. Paul. One man was spotted smashing a boulder into an ATM at Big Top Liquors on W. University Avenue. And around 1:35 p.m., about a block from Minnesota United's Allianz Field, Deryck Miller of St. Paul witnessed a shooting.
"A gentleman pulled out a gun and started shooting in this direction, and a person got out of that black car and ran away," said Miller, who was helping a friend who owns an automotive shop in the Midway neighborhood. "It's just been crazy out here."
Miller estimated that 90% of nearby businesses had been looted. By evening, a nearby NAPA Auto Parts store had been set on fire. Metro Transit suspended all bus and light-rail service through the weekend. Target ordered 24 area stores to close until further notice. On Thursday night, Minnehaha Lake Wine & Spirits in Minneapolis was set ablaze.
The worst-struck parts of the Twin Cities had the feel of a cat-and-mouse game. When a police vehicle pulled up to a strip mall in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, where a large crowd had smashed windows of a Verizon store, a Noodles & Co. and a Vitamin Shoppe, the crowd immediately scattered, only to re-emerge elsewhere.
Police formed a barricade in front of a Target there. But no officers were at the T.J. Maxx store a block away, so looters smashed the door down and fled with shoes and clothing piled on shopping carts.
As the violence spread, Walz activated the National Guard -- some 500 soldiers buttressed by 200 additional troopers from the State Patrol.
"It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect," Walz said in a statement. Floyd's death "should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction. As George Floyd's family has said, 'Floyd would not want people to get hurt. He lived his life protecting people.' Let's come together to rebuild, remember, and seek justice for George Floyd."
On Thursday, officials released the transcript of the 911 calls linked to Floyd's death. A 911 operator received the call at 8:01 p.m. Monday from a clerk at Cup Foods about a man, later suspected to be Floyd, who had bought cigarettes with fake money.
The caller reported that the man was outside in his car and "is awfully drunk, and he's not in control of himself."
After obtaining a physical description of the man and a vehicle associated with him, the operator said, "All right, I've got help on the way. If that vehicle or that person leaves before we get there, just give us a call back, otherwise we'll have squads out there shortly, OK?"
"No problem," the caller replied.
Police arrived and detained a handcuffed Floyd on the pavement as he begged to be allowed to breathe. Medics arrived and took Floyd to HCMC. He was unresponsive and lacking a pulse when he arrived.

The grief at heart of these days of rage

Full text: The George Floyd mural was taking shape, one brush stroke at a time, over the last streets he walked.
An act of creation in the middle of so much destruction.
"I love that. That warms my heart," said Diva Reynolds, smiling up at the tranquil image. "It looks just like him."
She's spent these days trying to comfort her 9-year-old daughter, Judeah, who had seen Floyd on the ground, handcuffed and helpless, pleading for help as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.
Minneapolis is burning. The governor called out the National Guard to deal with the crowds taking out generations of pent-up rage and injustice on Target stores.
In Minneapolis' collective grief, the corner of Chicago and E. 38th is a space to remember a singular loss.
Flowers, balloons and signs line the sidewalk. His face smiles out on posters in shop windows. There's a table of food for those who come hungry. Donated masks flutter from a clothesline.
"It felt like a day in need of an action," said Greta McLain, one of the Powderhorn neighborhood artists painting the new mural. She nodded to the paint and brushes. "We wanted to lend our tools. These are our tools."
The protests that started with the loss of one life erupted into a collective reckoning for lifetimes of injustice, generations of trauma.
Every traffic stop. Every store detective, trailing black customers through the aisles. Every bank that wouldn't help a black family get a mortgage. Every child sent off to a Minneapolis school where 88% of white children graduate on time, but a third of the black students don't.
All that pain exploded in one night. Businesses up and down Lake Street paid the price. And the chaos spread. Across the city, into St. Paul, into the suburbs.
But in the corner of the city where George Floyd took his last steps and final breaths, there are no broken windows or shattered businesses. Just broken hearts.
In the midst of collective trauma, this is a space to remember a singular loss. George Floyd, a gentle giant who loved this city and its people.
"Waking up this morning to see Minneapolis on fire would be something that would devastate Floyd," his girlfriend, Courteney Ross, told the Star Tribune. "He was all about love and peace."
Diva Reynolds loves this city, too.
"This is a very rich city," she said. "I'm not talking about money. I'm talking about spirit. … Everybody here is full of love. But we have some things that need to change."
She paused, her expression twisting in pain. "The hate," she said. "The hate is killing our city. It's choking our vines and our branches -- our children. Those children are our vines and branches."
Watching the artists at their work, she said, makes her forget some of the ugliness she's seen this week.
"They look so peaceful doing it," she said, watching one of the painters dab a bit of color on George Floyd's temple. "It looks therapeutic."

Full text: Elias Usso got an alert at home around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday when an alarm went off at his small pharmacy near Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue.
Then he watched the live security footage on his phone as looters ransacked the Seward Pharmacy shelves, set a small fire in the back and carted out a safe holding prescription drugs. "I saw the whole thing -- it was agonizing," he said Thursday afternoon as workers mopped up floors drenched from sprinklers and boarded up the shattered store windows. "My biggest concern is that my customers won't be able to get their prescriptions on time. That's a nightmare for a pharmacist."
More than 100 small businesses across Minneapolis were damaged during the protests Wednesday night over the death of George Floyd in police custody, said Allison Sharkey, executive director of the Lake Street Council, a nonprofit business coalition. Most of them were along Lake Street, but some were in other sections of the city, including Uptown and north Minneapolis.
Businesses hunker down
As more looting and vandalism continued Thursday and spread, including to St. Paul's Midway neighborhood, many businesses across the Twin Cities hunkered down for another potentially rough night. Businesses along Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis, which were not hit the night before, boarded up windows along with many others around the city.
Target pre-emptively closed 22 stores around the Twin Cities in addition to two on Lake Street that had been damaged the previous night.
After a sleepless night, business owners along Lake Street -- many already hurting from the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 -- emerged early Thursday and stared at what was left of their shops with quiet disbelief.
Charles Stotts, who has owned Town Talk Diner for four years, looked at his restaurant with gentle eyes and a somber frown. Smoke filled the dining room, and water from the sprinklers flooded the floor and poured onto the street.
"It's worse than anything I could have ever imagined happening to our little restaurant," said Stotts, who took part in the peaceful protest Tuesday night. "What did my little building on the side of the road do?"
On Wednesday night, the epicenter of the damage from the rioting was in the area around Lake and Hiawatha, where a Wendy's and an AutoZone smoldered the next morning. Smoke billowed from other buildings, the burning smell wafting across Lake Street.
Qiu Chen, owner of Twin City Laundromat, stood guard with his arms crossed outside his shop that as of Thursday afternoon had been mostly spared.
Chen had been up most of the night trying to ward off those trying to break in, pleading at one point with one man who took a hammer to his window to stop. Chen planned to do the same Thursday night.
Some storefronts put signs up noting they are minority-owned businesses in hopes that vandals would leave them alone.
Volunteers with brooms and garbage bags also showed up along Lake Street ready to help clean up the shattered glass, debris and other trash that littered the streets.
"We go to many of these businesses," said one of the volunteers, Lalo Regan Gonzalez.
"It's a whole different world," he said as he looked down Lake Street. "It doesn't look like Minneapolis."
Further east, Jeff Zeitler, who owns Urban Forage Winery & Cider House, walked down the sidewalk with a neighbor, holding a snow shovel to clear glass after his front door was smashed.
"George Floyd's death is a tragedy, it's terrible. The police killed this man, but it doesn't justify this," he said.
His wife, Gita Zeitler, later sat on the stoop in front of their shop. She said she was disappointed in a lack of security provided by the police for businesses. "The Minneapolis police has been useless for a long time," she said.
Tim Gleason, who has owned Precision Tune Auto Care on Lake for 20 years, stood outside his building as his mechanics picked up whatever tools were left inside the garage. He believed protesters stole five cars, driving them out right through the garage doors.
"Found one a block away at McDonald's," he said. "The worst part for me is that these guys' tools that were stolen aren't covered by the business insurance because it's their personal property. So hardworking mechanics are out a bunch of money."
'This is going to close me'
One building spared from rioting was Soderberg's Floral & Gift, a large, yellow flower shop on Lake and 33rd Avenue. Owner Kym Erickson had gone further down the street Thursday morning to see the rest of the destruction. She wasn't able to sleep all night, she said, watching the chaos unfold from the top floor of her building.
"It's hard to take it all in. It's unbelievable," she said. "It's been a night of terror, it's what it has been, to be on this street in this city last night."
She continued: "COVID didn't close me, but this is going to close me."
At least 30 businesses in Uptown Minneapolis showed signs of damage Thursday, with smashed storefronts, broken doors and fresh graffiti. Along Hennepin Avenue, H&M, Urban Outfitters, Timberland and Kitchen Window were among the stores being boarded up after windows had been smashed.
The Cub Foods on Lagoon, which had some damage, was back in business on Thursday morning.
It was unclear when a number of grocery stores, banks and pharmacies that had closed would be able to reopen.
CVS, for example, said it had closed six damaged locations in Minneapolis, including two inside Target stores. U.S. Bank closed two branches in the city.
A Cub Foods spokesman said it will take "substantial time to clean and rebuild" the grocery store near Lake and Hiawatha, which suffered significant damage. In the meantime, the retailer was working to give employees shifts at other stores in the area.
Some stores, such as Magers & Quinn bookstore, which have been closed for weeks aside from curbside pickup because of the pandemic, said they will postpone plans to reopen for in-store shopping.
Some restaurants suspended takeout service.
Surly said it will postpone plans to reopen its popular beer garden on Monday.
Sen. Jeff Hayden, DFL-Minneapolis, said Thursday he hopes the Legislature can act to help damaged small businesses, especially those already hurting from coronavirus-related closures.
Assistance sought
He wants to revive a proposal to provide small loans to minority-owned shops when the Legislature returns for a special session in mid-June.
"Lake Street has been devastated because of COVID. There were buildings, restaurants that were closing. I'm hearing from people from Midtown Global Market and others that are bleeding cash because they can't open," he said.
"We were targeting microloans for small businesses anyway; I think we can come in to support."
The Lake Street Council is collecting donations for the businesses through a new website (welovelakestreet.com).
Ingebretsen's, a Scandinavian gifts and food store on Lake Street, had its windows smashed and computers stolen in addition to expensive blankets and wool coats.
But Julie Ingebretsen, one of the shop's owners, said she's more worried about her smaller neighbors who were already on the edge and barely making it before this happened.
"We've been here for 99 years," she said. "We're not going anywhere."

Full text: State and federal authorities on Thursday pledged "robust and meticulous" dual investigations into the death of George Floyd, calling the case a top priority that will be monitored directly by President Donald Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
But the investigations could take some time -- maybe more than those protesting for justice in the streets had hoped.
"We are going to investigate it as expeditiously, as thoroughly and completely as justice demands," said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. "Sometimes that takes a little time. And we ask people to be patient."
Freeman called Floyd's death "senseless," but said moving too quickly could threaten the outcome of the case. He invoked the prosecution of Baltimore officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray, saying the district attorney there moved too quickly and lost the case as a result. "We have to do this right, and that's what we'll do," Freeman said.
Standing in front of the FBI field office in Brooklyn Center, Freeman joined U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald, FBI special-agent-in-charge Rainer Drolshagen and Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans. They collectively pledged a "thorough and expeditious" probe into the death of Floyd, three days after officer Derek Chauvin was filmed pressing his knee on Floyd's neck until Floyd lost consciousness during a police call over a suspected counterfeit bill and later died. Chauvin and three other officers at the scene have since been fired, while Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has demanded an arrest and charge in the case.
MacDonald said the federal investigation will focus on whether the officers used their authority as law enforcement agents to deprive Floyd of his constitutional rights. To meet the bar of this federal civil rights violation, investigators must prove the officers took action -- or failed to do so -- with knowledge of wrongdoing.
"It is imperative that the investigation is done right and done right the first time, and that is what we are going to do," said MacDonald, also signaling the charging decision may not come as swiftly as some had hoped. MacDonald said she learned about Floyd's death just hours after it occurred and has been working nonstop with the FBI since. "We understand the severity of the situation unfolding. It breaks my heart to see what is going on in the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and the suburbs, and I am pleading with individuals to remain calm and let us conduct this investigation."
MacDonald and Drolshagen said their respective offices along with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division "are conducting a robust criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd."
Freeman, whose office will handle any state criminal charges against the officers involved, said his office has been flooded with as many as 1,000 calls daily and countless e-mails demanding charges. He said he's still wading through the evidence. He declined to answer questions on why the events depicted in the video aren't enough to decide on charges.
"It's a violation of my ethics to talk about and evaluate evidence before a charging decision and I will not do that. I will say this: That that video is graphic and horrific and terrible and no person should do that. But my job in the end is to prove that he violated criminal statute. And there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge. We need to wade through all of that evidence to come to a meaningful determination and we are doing that to the best of our ability."
Freeman later issued a statement "that it is critical to review all the evidence because at the time of trial, invariably, all that information will be used."
Their comments came one day after Trump made his first comments about Floyd's death. While in Florida for what turned out to be the delayed SpaceX launch, the president called the incident "a very, very sad event" and added that he expected to receive a full report when he returns to the nation's capital.
The federal probe is separate from investigations into Floyd's death by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. In the meantime, calls are growing louder by the hour for the officers to be arrested and charged.
The FBI also is looking for anyone to come forward who might have useful information about the circumstances surrounding Floyd's death. "No tip is too small," said Drolshagen. To submit a tip, call 1-800-CALL-FBI.

Met Council clears out homeless camp
The Metropolitan Council cleared a large homeless encampment along Hiawatha Avenue in south Minneapolis on Thursday. The encampment, which formed in April, was too close for safety to the epicenter of protests over the death of George Floyd, said Terri Dresen, a spokeswoman for the Met Council, which controls the property. What started with just a few people a little more than a month ago quickly grew to a small neighborhood with more than 70 tents on a grassy right of way near the corner of Hiawatha Avenue and E. 28th Street. In an attempt to contain the site and discourage its growth, Metro Transit authorities put a fence around the tents early this month. They estimated that fewer than 100 people were living on the site by the time they began to clear it. Dresen said the Met Council will try to find temporary shelter for everyone who'd been there.

HENNEPIN COUNTY
2 commissioners press for charges
Two Hennepin County commissioners are pressing County Attorney Michael Freeman to charge four Minneapolis police officers in the death of George Floyd. Angela Conley and Irene Fernando, the board's first two commissioners of color, sent a letter Thursday to Freeman saying a disturbing video shot by a bystander clearly shows that the officers killed Floyd. "The community response we are experiencing is directed both at the outrage of this specific killing and the oppressive system that allowed it to happen," the commissioners wrote. Conley and Fernando said Minneapolis police need sweeping reforms.

TWIN CITIES
Bus, light rail service halted for next 3 days
All bus service throughout the Twin Cities has been suspended through Sunday night in anticipation of upcoming demonstrations, Metro Transit said late Thursday. The extraordinary move came after sometimes violent unrest that has persisted since the death of George Floyd at a Minneapolis intersection after he was pinned by the neck by a police officer. Transit spokesman Howie Padilla declined to attribute the suspensions solely to the street violence. It was necessary to impose the shutdown beyond the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul because "this is not limited to any single geographic area," Padilla said. Metro Transit said it will assess the situation through the weekend and issue an update on Sunday night.

Floyd's sister, Sharpton, NBA friend call for justice

Full text: Pleas for justice and poignant memories flowed in Wednesday for George Floyd, the man whose death soon after his takedown detention by police at a Minneapolis intersection led to unrest in the streets and the firings of the four officers involved.
"I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that's exactly what they did," said a sister, Bridgett Floyd, in an interview on NBC-TV's "Today." "I don't need them to be suspended and able to work in another state or another county. ... Their jobs should be taken, and they should be put in jail for murder."
Referencing a witness' video documenting the incident Monday night, when a white officer had his knee on her brother's neck until he fell unconscious, she said that officer and the others at the scene "murdered my brother. He was crying for help."
His sister appeared before the camera wearing a shirt reading "I can't breathe," which George Floyd repeated to officers while down on the pavement, an officer's knee pinning his neck.
As of Wednesday evening, the video had been viewed more than 1.2 million times on the Facebook page of the witness who shot it. Darnella Frazier told the Star Tribune she posted the video because "the world needed to see what I was seeing."
Police were called to a store at the corner of E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue on suspicion that George Floyd was trying to pass a fake $20 bill. They said the unarmed 46-year-old man from St. Louis Park was resisting arrest.
"He was a God-fearing man, regardless of what he [had] done," Bridgett Floyd said. "We all have our faults. We all make mistakes. Nobody's perfect."
Outrage and tears also flowed from a onetime National Basketball Association standout who knew George Floyd back in the day in the Houston area and called him "My Twin" in a series of sometimes tearful posts on Instagram.
"Where we from not many make it out but my Twin was happy I did," Stephen Jackson said in a posting accompanied by a photo including him, Floyd and others. "I'm gonna continue to make u proud fam. It makes me so angry that after all the things u been through when u get to your best self that they take u out like this."
Jackson, who retired in 2015 after 14 seasons in the NBA, said Floyd was working hard making a new life for himself in Minnesota.
"I just sent him two, three boxes of clothes, and my boy was doing what he was supposed to be doing," Jackson said. "I'm on my way to Minnesota, man. Whatever I can do. Can't let this ride."
A prayer vigil was held in George Floyd's hometown of Houston. Attending was Roxie Washington, mother to their 6-year-old daughter.
Washington told the Houston Chronicle during the outdoor vigil that Floyd attended Yates High School, where he played basketball and football and later performed in the local hip-hop scene.
"It's cruel" how he died, Washington told the Chronicle. "They took him away from my daughter."
The Rev. Al Sharpton, a national civil rights leader, said in an interview that he planned to bring the Eric Garner family to Minneapolis. Garner was killed by police in 2014 in a highly publicized case in which he told officers in New York City he couldn't breathe after he was placed in a choke hold.
"This morning, Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, and I had a phone call with the family of George Floyd to express our solidarity and resources until justice is served," Sharpton said in a separate statement.
Sharpton said in an interview that the officers "should not only lose their jobs, they should lose their freedom. You need to keep the spotlight on this."
In his time in Minnesota, George Floyd provided security for about five years at Conga Latin Bistro in Minneapolis, where he came by his nickname "Big Floyd" honestly, one co-worker said.
"He was tall and muscular," said Vernon Sawyerr, who overlapped for about four months with Floyd at Conga. "Just super kind. When you saw someone like that, he might seem imposing, but he was super sweet."
Floyd also had similar duties at the Salvation Army's Harbor Light homeless shelter in downtown Minneapolis in 2017 and early on in 2018.
"How tragic and sad this all is," said Brian Molohon, executive director of development for the charity's Northern Division. "It takes a special type of person to work in an emergency shelter. It is really hard to see heartbreak and brokenness every day. I have no doubt that George, like many other shelter workers in our community, had a heart that cared for people and our community."
Molohon said that how George Floyd died "is symptomatic of much deeper racial and socioeconomic issues in our community. We all are created with innate God-given worth and dignity."

No pulse when medics arrived for George Floyd

Full text: By the time George Floyd was en route to the hospital Monday evening, he was unresponsive and without a pulse. But for nearly an hour, first responders and ER staff refused to give up on the 46-year-old St. Louis Park man in their care.
"He still had an outside chance," said Hennepin Healthcare EMS Chief Marty Scheerer. "Even if it's a super long shot, you've got to try your best."
But 90 minutes after his initial encounter with Minneapolis police, Floyd was pronounced dead at HCMC.
"We feel the loss as well," said Scheerer, who believes paramedics did everything right after getting the medical distress call that evening.
A 10-minute video broadcast live on Facebook captured the moments that led up to Floyd's death. Officer Derek Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd's neck while he lies face down, handcuffed, and pleading that he can't breathe. Minutes later, Floyd goes limp and appears to lose consciousness. Hennepin EMS then arrive six minutes after the distress call.
Civilian footage shows a medical worker touching Floyd's head as Chauvin remains on top of him. Paramedics and officers eventually flip Floyd over, load him on a gurney and into the ambulance while he was still handcuffed. Once inside, a responder freed his hands.
The decision to "load and go," rather than triage at the scene, was likely based on their race against the clock, Scheerer said. Unloading all the equipment can often take much longer than treating a patient from inside the ambulance.
When pressed about a potential duty to intervene if a patient is endangered on a call, Scheerer surmised that, in this case, responders were unaware of how severe the situation had become.
"I don't think the paramedics knew what was going on. They just saw a split second of what was happening," he said in reference to Chauvin's prolonged knee restraint on Floyd's neck. "Ultimately, if the police have somebody in custody, we have to get permission from them to work with on the patient."
Fire Engine 17 arrived without lights and sirens just after the ambulance pulled away. The initial call started as a Code 2 to assist EMS on a scene, not the more urgent Code 3, indicating a life-threatening situation. Preliminary information given to firefighters said only that Floyd had "trauma to his mouth," according to an incident report.
Upon arrival, firefighters attempting to locate their patient were told by those gathered that police "had killed the man," the report says. "Bystanders were upset but not unruly."
The crew found an off-duty firefighter who reported witnessing the end of the struggle and watched as Floyd turned unresponsive in police custody. Dispatch notified firefighters that medics who just left the scene needed assistance, so they moved a few blocks away to meet up with the ambulance.
Two firefighters entered the rig as a medic was performing chest compressions on Floyd. They assisted getting IV and medications prepared as the paramedic continued to search for a pulse, the report said.
"When someone is not breathing, every second counts," said Mark Lakosky, president of Minneapolis Fire Local 82. His personnel are trained that someone can suffer brain damage in as little as four minutes without oxygen.
While en route to HCMC, EMS workers radioed ahead that they had picked up Floyd and were incoming.
"I've got a red medical, we'll be there in approximately six minutes," a medic relayed, according to emergency dispatch audio. "Thirties, male, was being detained by PD … was on a … was a cardiac arrest upon EMS arrival, apparently doing CPR, getting access, getting vitals, bagging, calling ACLS [advanced cardiovascular life support], we'll be there in six minutes, red medical, COVID symptoms are unknown."
Floyd's condition never changed, even after an electric shock to the chest. The incident report stops once he was handed off to emergency room staff. Doctors continued additional lifesaving measures, but Scheerer declined to specify what kind, citing medical privacy rules.
Floyd's official time of death was recorded at 9:25 p.m.
A Hennepin County medical examiner report was inconclusive about Floyd's exact cause and manner of death, "pending further testing and investigation."
The two paramedics who worked to save his life went straight back to duty, tapped the very next day to respond to unrest in south Minneapolis prompted by Floyd's death.
"They do feel a lot of sorrow because of this," said Scheerer, who briefly met with them after the dust settled. "Our hearts go out to Floyd's family and friends."

Full text: Phil Williams and Ryan Burnet met at the Uppercut Boxing Gym in northeast Minneapolis a decade ago. Williams was a heavyweight carrying the nickname "Phil the Drill" and Burnet was there as a boxing aficionado.
Later, Burnet was in a group of instructors with a summertime program on the North Side.
"I saw what boxing did for the small group we worked with -- that moment when a young man realizes you get out of something what you put into it -- and knew I had a passion for this particular work," Burnet said.
Burnet and partners were able to purchase an abandoned firehouse on 17th Street and 33rd Ave. North for $40,000, then fundraising of over a half-million turned it into a large boxing facility that opened in February 2015.
Williams and Mohammed Kayongo, another pro, became the lead instructors -- the true boxers who made tremendous connections with boys and girls from ages 9 through 18.
Burnet, lead partner in the Barrio Restaurant Group, had food delivered in bulk from his restaurants. The young men and women participating in the program could eat at either 5 p.m. or 7 p.m., or both. The gym was shut down with all others in March, and Burnet's waiting to resume the Northside Boxing Club program.
There were over 40 kids, most black and many said to be raised in poverty, on a night I visited before Christmas in December 2017. The camaraderie was impressive. The only signs of unhappiness were when someone took a punch when sparring.
Ryan comes from the Burnet real estate family that turned into the mighty Coldwell Banker Burnet. He had an office upstairs at the converted firehouse, and wife Amber at home, with daughter Layla and newborn twins, Cy and Ivy.
Burnet was on the phone a few times, checking with Amber, and checking with his restaurants, but he was there -- ready to do what Williams and Kayongo and others required -- most every night, Monday through Friday.
"Ryan has been a blessing," Williams said Wednesday. "That's my brother."
And then the anger simmered through the cellphone and Williams said: "Ryan has an understanding for this, about what's going on. But he doesn't know the feeling. He can't know the feeling."
Ryan's white. I'm white.
We can be mortified by what we witnessed on that video of Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin ending George Floyd's life by kneeling on the black civilian's neck, but it's unlikely we can feel the 100% rage.
On Tuesday, I was asked about Floyd's death and the 10-minute video on which it was captured. I stumbled for the right word and finally said, "Disgusting."
I never needed a thesaurus more than at that moment, because this needless death was so far beyond "disgusting" that it's an embarrassment to have used the term.
The difference between mortified whiteness and "No more!" anger from a black man also was validated by this:
I watched about four minutes of Chauvin's powerful knee and Floyd's pleading to live before cutting off the video. I asked Burnet for his reaction to the video and he said, "Sickness. I only made it a couple of minutes."
I asked the same of Phil Williams and he said:
"I watched all 10 minutes and saw the life going out of a human being every second. I can't stop watching it. We're seeing a modern-day lynching. A man is being put to death and there are other cops just standing by, watching.
"I had never seen a lynching. I have now, and when George Floyd was dead, did you see the way they handled his body? He was thrown like a sack of potatoes."
The Northside gym being closed has led Williams to continue boxing lessons in his garage and elsewhere.
"My kids are seeing this. And the message they'll get from me is, 'This is what they think about you. If you're out there and see a cop, don't say anything about your rights, because you're black and have no rights with them.' "
Williams' reference to "kids" includes his own, but also the 25-30 that he trains as boxers.
"In UFC, professionally trained fighters, you're not allowed to use a prolonged chokehold," Williams said. "This was a 10-minute chokehold against a regular street civilian. It would have killed anybody."
He paused, then the fire returned to his voice:
"There had better be swift justice, with this cop being thrown into the general population in prison … like would be the case for one of us, for a black man. When that happens, then maybe we can talk."
White folks can understand Williams' anger, but no way can we feel it in every pore as does a 42-year-old black man who grew up in Minneapolis.

Death of Floyd saddens, sickens: Sports figures share outrage.

Full text: The death of George Floyd while in police custody on Monday in Minneapolis has sparked outrage locally and beyond.
Powerful video of the 47-year-old Floyd pleading, "I can't breathe" as a police officer kneels on his neck has led to similarly powerful reactions -- including many from the world of sports. Here are some of those reactions from social media -- some from local athletes and others worldwide:
• Gophers wide receiver Rashod Bateman reacted with a strong yet heartbreaking message on Twitter. He wrote, in part: "I'm an African Male from South Georgia. I never thought in a million years I would be scared to walk outside. I pray that we all wake up and start loving each other the correct way and stop taking each other lives."
• LeBron James posted on Instagram to his 65 million followers an image of Floyd next to an image of Colin Kaepernick, with the words: "Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you?? #StayWoke"
• Former Lynx star and FSN TV analyst Rebekkah Brunson called the way Floyd died "inhumanely sickening."
• Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie added perspective with his own message on Twitter. He wrote: "I'm a big believer in being proactive, not reactive. It's cool to have justice for people after they die, and it's cool to punish cops accordingly. But instead of reacting to each situation, we need to look the real problem in the eye and stop any further unnecessary killings."
• Twins manager Rocco Baldelli tweeted, "George Floyd should be breathing right now. We have a lot of progress to make. A lot. Remember his name. Remember what happened."
• Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr didn't mince words, calling what happened to Floyd "murder."
• Women's basketball legend Lisa Leslie -- with a message that was retweeted thousands of times, including by former Lynx player Seimone Augustus -- challenged her followers to pay attention. She wrote on Twitter: "If anybody that follows me is not outraged about these senseless attacks on BLACK MEN, please stop following me! If your spirit is not disturbed, please stop following me! This inflicted Pain but it will never inflict FEAR ... sorry, were not made like that! #BlackMenMatter."

A day later in the city that killed Floyd

Author: Brooks, Jennifer

Full text: Tuesday night in the city that killed George Floyd, a group of young black men were working out at the office gym.
Someone was watching.
Down the road, people were marching and mourning Floyd, whose irreplaceable life ended after an arrest face-down on the asphalt of E. 38th Street.
"Please, please," he had called out to the Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck. "I can't breathe."
The marchers made their way to the Third Precinct, where police in riot gear were waiting with tear gas, flashbangs and less lethal projectiles.
Back at the gym at the Mozaic East office building in Uptown, a group of young black men watched a white man approach who was snapping pictures and demanding to see some identification that would prove they belonged there.
"I'm Tom Austin. I'm a tenant in the building. Are you?" Austin says on a video of the exchange posted on Instagram by Top Figure, a social media marketing firm headquartered in Mozaic East. "I'm calling 911."
Austin started dialing his phone, joining the long list of entitled white people threatening to call the cops on black people who are just going about their day -- barbecuing in a public park, selling lemonade, golfing too slowly and most recently, being an avid birder who asks a white woman to follow the rules and keep her dog on a leash. The police are coming and then you'll be sorry.
"Normally we don't speak out about encounters of racial profiling and age discrimination that we face day to day in our lives as young black entrepreneurs," the Instagram post began. They did not respond to interview requests.
"We all pay rent here and this man demanded that we show him our key cards or he will call the cops on us," the post continued. "We are sick and tired of tolerating this type of behavior on a day-to-day basis."
Austin is best known to Minneapolis as the venture capitalist who fought long and hard to change Bde Maka Ska's name back to Lake Old Southern Racist. The old name, he argues, is easier to pronounce than the original Dakota and besides, as he wrote in a Star Tribune op-ed, "What exactly have the Dakota Indians done that is a positive contribution to all Minnesotans?"
Top Figure's video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times and Austin has gotten so many scathing e-mails, he's set up an auto-reply that begins: "Yes, I [expletive] up. Should have handled it differently."
To clarify, he said, he didn't call 911. He called the building manager, who had sent out a complaint about non-tenants using the gym. He was convinced that the group of men were sharing a single key fob to get in and out of the room, rather than each having their own key like a tenant should.
"I'm almost a good Samaritan," Austin said. "If something's not right, I'll step up to do something or say something."
Something's not right in Minnesota, land of some of the worst racial disparities in America. There are yawning gaps between white and black Minnesotans in education, homeownership, employment, salaries, health, infant mortality and incarceration rates.
In Minneapolis, a city where 63% of the population is white, 63% of the people shot and killed by police between 2000 and 2018 were black.
Only 8% of the police who patrol our streets live on our streets. The rest live elsewhere.
Minneapolis is just a job for them.
"What am I not understanding? What do I seem to be clueless about?" Austin wondered. "Are we going to be in a space where, if someone does something suspicious, we have to ignore it and not say anything if they're black?"
Maybe if we all work very hard, the city that killed George Floyd will become a space where the default assumption is that everyone belongs here and anyone deserves to survive their next encounter with the police.

Violent protests intensify: New fury in the streets; Frey calls for cop's arrest

Full text: Hours after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for a police officer's arrest and charges in the death of George Floyd, violent protests erupted anew, causing widespread damage and looting at south Minneapolis storefronts.
Late Wednesday, one person was fatally shot in the protest area, but it was not immediately clear if that death was related to the protests.
A Target and Cub Foods anchoring the corner of E. Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue were looted, along with other small businesses, including Minnehaha Lake Wine & Spirits. Flames and smoke shot into the air when a nearby AutoZone auto parts store was set ablaze. As some protesters tried to put out the fire, others danced gleefully in front of it, snapping selfies.
The violence followed a daylong protest outside the Third Precinct police headquarters, where officers sought to disperse crowds with flash-bang grenades, tear gas and projectiles through the day and night.
Earlier, Frey called for the arrest and charging of now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck as he pleaded to breathe.
"I've wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?" Frey said. "If you had done it, or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that."
Frey's comments came on the second day of widespread protests over Floyd's death, which occurred shortly after police detained him Monday on suspicion of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.
In addition to the protests near the Third Precinct in Minneapolis, demonstrators also gathered Wednesday at the homes of Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and the Oakdale home of Chauvin.
Frey said he was calling for action by Freeman, who has the authority to seek charges in Floyd's death. "We are working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the Hennepin County Medical Examiner to expeditiously gather and review all of the evidence in the tragic death of Mr. George Floyd," Freeman's office said in a statement. "The videotaped death of Mr. Floyd, which has outraged us and people across the country, deserves the best we can give and that is what this office will do."
State Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said the BCA investigation, which he oversees, is underway. "We will do an expeditious investigation. We will ensure that this is not an investigation that lags," he said, adding that the department also won't cut corners to complete its work quickly.
Because the BCA and FBI are conducting a joint investigation, those two agencies have the authority to make an arrest, said police spokesman John Elder. Either agency could arrest any of the four officers at any time if they believe they have probable cause. The BCA would send the case to Freeman's office for charging, while the FBI would send the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
The city identified the officers involved as Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. Chief Medaria Arradondo fired all four Tuesday. Chauvin, 44, is a 19-year department veteran. Thao is a 12-year veteran. Kueng joined the department in 2017 and Lane in 2019.
Chauvin is represented by attorney Tom Kelly. Thao is represented by Robert Paule, Kueng by Thomas Plunkett, and Lane by Earl Gray. All declined to comment.
Minneapolis Police Federation President Lt. Bob Kroll did not respond to messages requesting comment and declined to take questions from a reporter at his office. However, he said in a statement provided to Forum News Service before Tuesday's firings that, "Now is not the time to rush to judgment and immediately condemn our officers. We ask that the community remain calm and the investigation be completed in full."
'Shocked and horrified'
Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday that he was "shocked and horrified" by the video of Floyd's death. President Donald Trump called Floyd's death "very sad and tragic."
"I have asked for this investigation to be expedited and greatly appreciate all of the work done by local law enforcement," Trump wrote in a tweet. "My heart goes out to George's family and friends. Justice will be served!"
Frey said he made the decision to call for charges after watching the video. He said he has not spoken to the officers involved or seen the footage captured by their body cameras. Frey said the restraint technique used against Floyd is not authorized by the MPD, is not something officers were trained in and "should not be used, period."
"We watched for five whole excruciating minutes as a white officer firmly pressed his knee into the neck of an unarmed handcuffed black man. I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary," Frey said.
He noted that in many other cases, officers' decisions are made in "four or five or six seconds."
"We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly," Frey said. "There's somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes, every one of which the officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd's neck."
On Wednesday, the Minnesota Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Board said Chauvin's actions do not reflect any training officers receive.
"The video is troubling and disturbing and it is the Board's position that sanctity of life must be the guiding principle for all law enforcement officers," the statement said.
In additional fallout from the Floyd case, University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel announced that the school will cut some ties with the Minneapolis police, including no longer contracting for off-duty security at football games, concerts and ceremonies, and terminating its contract for bomb-sniffing dogs.
"We will limit our collaboration with the MPD to joint patrols and investigations that directly enhance the safety of our communities or that allow us to investigate and apprehend those who put our students, faculty, and staff at risk," Gabel said in a letter to students and faculty.
Eric Hageman, a Minnesota attorney who has successfully sued police officers in brutality cases, said that use of force must be "objectively reasonable" from the officer's perspective at the time it was used, a standard established in a landmark 1989 Supreme Court case, Graham v. Connor.
Among the factors a court might consider are the severity of the underlying crime, whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest and whether his or her behavior presented a threat to the safety of the officer or anyone else. It's unclear whether the officers had previous contacts with Floyd, but his Minnesota criminal history was limited to a pair of traffic violations.
"The video would appear that he was using force solely for the purpose of inflicting harm, which is unconstitutional," Hageman said of the officer.
The death has also renewed calls for overhauling the police department's culture, although most critics have stopped short of calling for the chief's resignation.
Elizer Darris, an organizer with the ACLU, said he sees a need to root out a culture that prioritizes covering for one another. This "blue code of silence" continued even after Arradondo issued an order saying that officers who allowed their colleagues to behave badly would also be held responsible.
"Even if that's your blue brother, the preservation of life should be paramount to everything else," he said.
The FBI is also assisting with the investigation, and while Frey said he believes charging authority lies with Freeman, he added that to the extent federal authorities have jurisdiction, "Yeah, I'm calling on that, too."
He said he had not seen any evidence that Floyd resisted arrest, and that he wants the body camera footage released "as soon as possible, while not compromising the investigation but, more importantly, the charge that I hope will come forward."

LEADERS REACT TO FLOYD'S DEATH
"A very sad event."
President Donald Trump
"Watching his life be taken in the same manner, echoing nearly the same words as Eric Garner more than five years ago -- 'I can't breathe' -- is a tragic reminder that this was not an isolated incident, but part of an ingrained systemic cycle that exists in this country."
Former Vice President Joe Biden
"It's very clear to anyone that what happened to George Floyd is wrong. The lack of humanity in the video made me physically ill, and even more difficult to understand. My heart aches for Mr. Floyd's family and friends."
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz
"I challenged our officers to ask themselves if they would have done anything differently from what the officers did in the video. If the answer is no, I told them to reconsider their career choice."
St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell
"Being black in America should not be a death sentence. For five minutes, we watched a white officer press his knee into a black man's neck. Five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you're supposed to help. This officer failed in the most basic, human sense."
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey
"This is why we talk about police abolition."
