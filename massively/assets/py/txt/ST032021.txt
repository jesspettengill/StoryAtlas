Full text: Darnella Frazier has been hailed as a hero by many for bringing George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody to the world's eyes and aiding the criminal prosecution by recording it in a video viewed millions of times. But her testimony in court Tuesday revealed a deep vein of trauma that haunts the teenager, whose trip to buy snacks forever altered her life.
Frazier's vulnerability was underscored when three other witnesses, who were also minors at the time, testified in the murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin. They told the court they immediately knew something was wrong when they came upon the scene but felt helpless and feared for their safety as officers ignored their pleas to stop restraining Floyd, pushed other bystanders and shook a can of Mace at them.
Frazier recorded the longest independent video of what happened to Floyd on May 25 outside Cup Foods in Minneapolis.
"When I look at George Floyd I look at my dad, I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles, because they are all Black," said Frazier, her voice faltering. "I have a Black father, I have a Black brother, I have Black friends. I look at that and I look at how it could have been one of them."
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill allowed testimony from Frazier and the three witnesses who followed to be broadcast via audio on a livestream of the trial but prohibited video broadcast of them because they were all juveniles at the time.
The day's testimony ended with a Minneapolis firefighter who happened upon the scene while off duty. She recounted how she immediately knew Floyd needed help and desperately tried to render aid only to be rebuffed by police. Chauvin is on trial for second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Frazier, 18, was 17 when she and her 9-year-old cousin, Judeah Reynolds, went to Cup Foods to buy snacks. She recounted how she ushered her cousin inside the store to protect her while she positioned herself near the back of a squad car and used her cellphone to record Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.
"I've stayed up apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life," said a tearful Frazier. "It's not what I should have done; it's what [Chauvin] should have done."
Frazier refrained from wiping her tears away as jurors listened, many of them looking on sympathetically, according to reporters in the courtroom.
Frazier, dressed in a blue pantsuit, also testified that Chauvin had a "cold look -- heartless. It didn't seem like he cared."
Special Attorney for the State Jerry Blackwell showed Frazier a still image of Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd's neck taken from her video. He asked her if she recognized him.
"Yes," whispered Frazier as she struggled to speak. "Yes, yes, this was the officer that was kneeling on George Floyd's neck."
Defense attorney Eric Nelson was brief in his cross-examination, crafting questions to set the scene as growing increasingly hostile and creating a potential threat to the officers. Former officer J. Alexander Kueng knelt on Floyd's back while colleagues Thomas Lane knelt and held onto his legs and Tou Thao kept a crowd at bay. The three are set to be tried together Aug. 23 for aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
Frazier agreed with Nelson that bystanders were getting louder and angrier, but added that no one was threatening Chauvin.
Nelson also worked another part of his defense aimed at showing that the police encounter with Floyd was more extensive and complex than the final portion bystanders witnessed.
"It's fair to say … as you approached them, Mr. Floyd was already in that position, he was on the ground and anything that happened prior to that you wouldn't be privy to or know what happened?" he asked.
"Correct," Frazier said.
Nelson has argued that Floyd was resisting arrest, posed a possible threat to officers and likely died of a drug overdose and pre-existing health conditions, including heart disease.
Reynolds briefly took the stand next, testifying that Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck until paramedics arrived.
"They asked him nicely to get off of [Floyd]," Reynolds said.
Blackwell asked her how Chauvin responded.
"Still stayed on him," she said. "… I was sad and kind of mad and it felt like it was stopping his breathing and it was hurting him."
Nelson declined to cross-examine Reynolds.
Alyssa Funari, 18, also recorded the incident and echoed much of Frazier's testimony, but noted that Chauvin added more of his weight onto Floyd's neck as he struggled. She testified that she told Chauvin to get off Floyd, and that he remained kneeling while a paramedic checked Floyd's neck for a pulse; none was found.
Assistant Attorney General Erin Eldridge played Funari's video in court, which captured her pleading with officers to relent. Funari grew emotional at one point during her testimony.
"Alyssa, why is this difficult for you to talk about?" Eldridge asked.
"It was difficult because I felt like there wasn't really anything I could do," she said. "As a bystander I was powerless there, and I was failing to do anything."
Kaylynn Gilbert, 17, testified she had gone to Cup Foods with her friend, Funari. She described how Chauvin grabbed a can of chemical irritant and shook it at bystanders while kneeling on Floyd.
"Scared," she said of her reaction, her voice beginning to falter with emotion, "because I didn't know what was going to happen. I was scared of Chauvin."
The second day of testimony began Tuesday with a key witness, Donald Williams II, back on the witness stand. Williams testified Monday that his experience as a mixed martial arts trainer and fighter told him Chauvin was using a "blood choke" to squeeze the life out of Floyd.
Nelson pressed Williams Tuesday about the mechanics of the move in an attempt to dispute the prosecution's assertion that Floyd died from oxygen deprivation. He asked if a blood choke is typically applied to the side of the neck and protects airflow in the trachea. Williams said Nelson was confusing his chokeholds.
Nelson asked if Williams grew progressively angry at the scene.
"You can't paint me as angry," Williams said.
The day ended with testimony from Minneapolis firefighter Genevieve Hansen, 27, who happened upon the scene on her day off.
"I identified myself right away because I noticed that he needed medical attention," said Hansen, a two-year member of the Fire Department. "It didn't take long to notice that he had an altered level of consciousness. My attention moved from Mr. Floyd to, 'How can I gain access to this patient and give him medical attention or provide direction to the officers?' "
She was repeatedly rebuffed by Thao.
"There is a man being killed," she said, "and I would have been able to provide medical attention to the best of my abilities, and this human was not provided that right."
"How did it make you feel?" asked Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank.
"Totally distressed."
"Were you frustrated?" he asked.
"Yes," Hansen said as she began to cry.

Full text: Criticism and protests have followed Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman for years, from the lobby of the county courthouse to his news conferences, which have been overtaken by demonstrators on occasion.
But when George Floyd was fatally pinned under three Minneapolis police officers last May 25, the public outcry reached fever pitch and landed at his doorstep. Protesters gathered several times in groups of hundreds to more than a thousand outside Freeman's south Minneapolis home to criticize what they felt was a pro-police response to Floyd's killing and a pattern of inaction on police killing civilians.
"There has to be political pressure," said Sam Martinez, an organizer with Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, one of many groups that participated in protests outside Freeman's house. "Mike Freeman represented … that continual miscarriage of justice in a system that really doesn't want
to give [justice] to us."
Freeman's office charged former officer Derek Chauvin in the case on May 29 before the state Attorney General's Office quickly took over the prosecution. Freeman's office is assisting.
The public criticism, which also came from many others via e-mails, phone calls and social media messages and postings, prompted the county to spend about $19,000 in salary and overtime costs for sheriff's deputies to provide security for Freeman between May 27 and early June. Freeman put his house up for sale in July and sold it for less than what he paid 13 years earlier.
The county shelled out another $9,385 to a private firm to conduct a safety assessment for an assistant county attorney involved in the case, according to the county attorney's office and financial records obtained by the Star Tribune.
"They did a security review to make sure everything this person did was as safe as could be -- anything that would expose them to potential danger as they go through their normal routines," county attorney spokesman Chuck Laszewski said.
Laszewski said the county attorney's office received "credible threats." Freeman declined to comment, and his office declined to provide more details because of its role in prosecuting Chauvin and former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao in Floyd's death.
Chauvin is on trial on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His three co-defendants were charged on June 3 and will be tried in one trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All four, who were fired, are out on bond. Hennepin County Sheriff's spokesman Andy Skoogman said the sheriff has no open or closed cases regarding threats made to Freeman or his office.
The backlash was like nothing Washington County Attorney Pete Orput, a former assistant Hennepin County attorney, had seen before.
"I've never seen this in my entire life," Orput said. "[Freeman] got vilified, and I think people get angry and they look for a target … and social media's changed the landscape."
Freeman's office received nearly 4 million e-mails and 29,000 voice mails about the case, most of them in the first two weeks after Floyd was killed. Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker was also publicly criticized for ruling Floyd's cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest; attorneys for Floyd's family and many others disputed the findings and said Floyd died of asphyxiation from Chauvin kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes.
Former Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner said some critics went too far.
"You can vote that person out of office if you don't like what they did, but to personalize it in this way and threaten the quality of life and safety of the elected official's family is really inexcusable," Gaertner said. Going forward, she added, "I hope it's not the norm."
Many messages to the county attorney's office implored Freeman to take swift action and charge the officers involved.
"The entire world is watching your office today," said one message sent the day after Floyd died. "Do the right thing. Prosecute Derek Chauvin."
"Arrest and prosecute the men who murdered George Floyd. Right now. Immediately," said a message sent two days after the incident. "Your historical callousness to justice for people of color has been horrendous. You could now, right now, start to change. Do it now. Not tomorrow. Now."
In the wake of Floyd's death, activists created the group Recall Mike Freeman and launched a campaign to collect 126,522 signatures in an effort to force him out of office. About 16,000 signatures have been collected.
"Mike Freeman acts as a defense attorney for the police," said Kathleen Cole, an organizer with Recall Mike Freeman. "He takes what they say at face value, and even when the claims they are making are pretty absurd-sounding. In this case, people could see what really happened and so his continued defense of the police and unwillingness to prosecute them appropriately was especially upsetting."
Recall Mike Freeman did not organize protests outside his home but was present on occasion to take signatures.
Freeman's office has charged Minneapolis police officers in two civilian deaths -- Floyd and the 2017 fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond by Mohamed Noor, who was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Activists say he has failed to charge too many other officers, particularly in the killings of Black men such as Jamar Clark, who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police in 2015.
"Mike Freeman kind of represents where things were stopping in the system," Martinez said.
Freeman's office declined to comment on the timing and whether the protests were a factor, but in July Freeman listed his home for sale at $749,000. The price steadily dropped until the house, which sustained damage over the year, sold in late December for $600,000, according to online real estate listings. Freeman and his wife purchased it in 2007 for $629,900.
The scrutiny is far from over. Recall Mike Freeman activists plan to spread their message to the suburbs this summer to reach Freeman's strongest voting base. The group will collect signatures and also educate voters on criminal justice reform.
Freeman's term ends in 2022. Laszewski said Freeman has not decided if he will seek re-election "because the election is still 18 months away and all of his attention is on the Derek Chauvin trial."

Trauma relived as trial unfolds before the world

Full text: The world took a front-row seat to the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on Monday, as the state's first-ever courtroom video livestream gave an intimate view of a case that has fractured the nation.
For many Minnesotans, re-watching video of George Floyd struggling for his final breaths under Chauvin's knee revived feelings of trauma and invoked the unease of a riot-damaged Twin Cities becoming the epicenter of debate on racial equity.
"This image will remain in a lot of people's mind," said Abdulkadir Noor, 38, who on Monday morning was at the 1st Cup Cafe located in the shopping center across from the burned-down Minneapolis Police Third Precinct building, as several people glanced at the news during their morning coffee runs.
Noor said he didn't like that the trial was televised and added that he thinks the court proceedings will trigger pain in people traumatized by the video that went viral last summer.
At Trinity Apartments in south Minneapolis, 51-year-old resident Cheri Lopez started to watch the trial in the morning until the prosecution began to play the video during opening statements.
"I thought that him with his knee on his neck was too violent," she said. "That's why I shut it off."
Others went about their day and said they were withholding judgment until a verdict is reached at the end of trial, expected to last weeks.
Duane Giese, of Watertown, ran into an Eden Prairie gas station over his lunch hour and said people need to try to see both sides of the case before coming to a conclusion instead of being ruled by their emotions.
"More people should be looking at the whole picture -- both sides of the coin," said Giese, 52. "There's a lot of variables to the story, and what you hear might not be true. I'm trying to hear both sides. That's how you judge a person on their guilt."
With opening statements, viewers got their first look into the strategies of the defense and prosecution to paint contrasting pictures of the circumstances surrounding Floyd's death. They could also see the faces and hear the words of witnesses including a bystander with wrestling and martial arts experience and a 911 dispatcher who reported to a supervising sergeant that something didn't seem right as she watched real-time surveillance video on a screen in her office.
Many in the community were hesitant to talk about their views as the difficult topics of race and justice took center stage in the community, and the intensity of the trial weighed heavily on people's minds.
At Benedict's Morning Heroes in Wayzata, 27-year-old Naomi Ladd said the trial was amplifying the difficulty of expressing feelings about race.
As a Black woman, Ladd said, she sometimes feels like she has to hold back.
"When we walk out the door every day, it's something we have to challenge ourselves with being cordial about, not just this case but our own survival day by day, and how to voice it the proper way to others so they may not feel attacked by you expressing justice to your own life," Ladd said. "The trial just kind of amplifies that. You still can't say how you want to express yourself."
Earlier in the day, the Rev. Al Sharpton, George Floyd's family and civil rights attorneys gathered outside of the Hennepin County Courthouse and spoke about the gravity of the trial before they knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds in honor of Floyd, signifying the time that some observed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck.
"Today is the start of a landmark trial that will be a referendum on how far America has come on its quest for equality and justice for all," said attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd's family.
Crump reminded the crowd and those watching from home that Chauvin was the man on trial, not Floyd.
The day began and ended with protests outside the courthouse. About 300 people gathered in the evening to listen to speakers, including family members of people killed during interactions with police, and marched for justice on nearby streets.
A small group yelled at National Guard soldiers watching from behind fences surrounding barricaded government buildings.
Army veteran Samantha Pree-Stinson hung a thick rope of dog tags that represented Black, brown and Indigenous soldiers who lost their lives. She's lived in Minneapolis for 20 years, she said, and is taxed from stressing over the trial's outcome.
"I think we're going to see the same thing that happens every time, but I don't want to speak anything into existence," Pree-Stinson said.
Though other high-profile cases have been televised around the country, such as the O.J. Simpson trial more than 25 years ago, the power of social media has allowed more people to engage and comment in real time on the Chauvin trial.
"It gives everybody an insight of what goes on in a courtroom and how you have to get the evidence," said Charles Menifee, 50, as he watched the trial on a large television at the 8218 Truce Center in St. Paul where he mentors young people.
Menifee, who helps teenagers resolve conflicts and stay on the right track, said he often tells young Black men including his 10-year-old son that they need to follow instructions given by police to try to avoid deadly interactions.
"We know we are targeted. … We feel like we shouldn't have to [have these talks] but we have to because we are Black and we are being treated differently," Menifee said.
Some in the Twin Cities begrudgingly braced themselves for riots and further unrest after the case wraps up.
"I'm 100% concerned that if there's an acquittal, there's going to be a significant amount of rioting nationally if not internationally," said Brandt Grandy, 57, who was on a walk in Wayzata on Monday afternoon with his 19-year-old son Finn. "We're all connected through social media. The world is looking at the outcome of this. You really hope the legal system in our country is blind to ethnicity and skin color. We all hope that it is. We just don't know that it is. But it's time for it to be."

Full text: Speakers at a prayer service on the eve of opening statements in the Derek Chauvin murder and manslaughter trial urged peace, unity and justice for George Floyd.
"My brother didn't ask for this," Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, said at a news conference before the Sunday night vigil. "I didn't ask to be a part of this fraternity that nobody wants to be a part of. I think about my brother every day and every night. I think about his kids."
Floyd urged observers to focus on the bystander video taken of his brother's final breaths as he asked for a conviction.
"I have faith that he will get convicted. Just like everybody who's seen that video because the video is the proof," he said.
The vigil at Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Minneapolis began with gospel music and dance. But as Pastor Billy G. Russell began to speak, a heckler interrupted. She was escorted out to cheers as Russell prayed for "peaceful and effective protests."
The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of National Action Network, called for accountability.
"We must show with this case that a police officer must face the law just like anybody else," he said.
Philonise Floyd also urged unity, saying there's only one race, the human race. "It's not Black versus white, it's not Asian versus white, it's not anything like that," he said. "People of color need to learn how to live with each other and love each other."
Earlier Sunday, leaders of a protest in downtown Minneapolis also demanded justice for George Floyd.
Speaker after speaker at the rally between the Hennepin County Government Center and City Hall urged participants to call for the convictions of Chauvin and former officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng. They also asked protesters to fight for charges to be dropped against hundreds of protesters arrested since last summer, ending qualified immunity for police, and "systemic change."
"We all saw the video! … What do you all think? Think he's guilty?" D.J. Hooker, a Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar organizer, asked the crowd of about 150, which responded, "Guilty, guilty, guilty!"
Hooker welcomed supporters to what he called "the war zone," saying Minneapolis used to have a downtown people could use, but now it's a fortress of security, with fencing, concrete and barbed wire. Hooker and others said they're not afraid to be disruptive.
"They thought it was a joke, right? They don't take our chants serious, right? No justice, no peace. We meant that," he said.
Organizers promoted a petition for community control of the Minneapolis Police Department. The protest was peaceful, but a couple of protesters parked their cars on the light-rail tracks, blocking train traffic through Government Plaza Station.
"We shut down trains and light rails all the time, just wait," Monique Cullers-Doty called out when a light-rail conductor asked protesters to vacate the tracks. Cullers-Doty is the aunt of Marcus Golden, who was killed by St. Paul police in 2015.
Protesters circled back to the Government Center and zip-tied posters to the security fence separating them from armed National Guard troops.
At 38th and Chicago, also known as George Floyd Square, self-identified anarchists and anti-fascists with the organization Minnesota Uprising Arrestee Support planned a workshop on avoiding arrest and keeping calm in custody. Protesters who declared the intersection was not a public street demanded journalists leave the square.

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: RACE WON'T BE COURT'S FOCUS ; AS THE PUBLIC WEIGHS BROADER ISSUES, TRIAL TO EXAMINE ACTIONS.

Full text: In the streets, protesters are assailing years of police violence against Black people as Derek Chauvin goes on trial in the killing of George Floyd. In the courtroom, potential jurors have disclosed their views on racial discrimination.
But the proceedings set to begin with opening statements Monday are unlikely to address those themes directly, even as the case has become a flashpoint for racial justice in America.
Instead, the testimony and evidence will focus on a narrow set of facts about the evening that Chauvin knelt on the neck of Floyd, a Black man, as other officers helped hold Floyd down outside a Minneapolis convenience store.
"Something that's going to be jarring to some is that this trial is not going to be about race," law Prof. Mark Osler said during a recent panel discussion at the University of St. Thomas. "In criminal law, what the government has to prove is the elements of the crime … and none of those elements has to do with race."
He added: "That means that there's going to be a real disconnect between what goes on [outside] the courthouse, where people will be talking about race, and what goes on inside."
Video of Chauvin, a white officer, kneeling on Floyd's neck for close to 9 minutes last May sparked a global movement against racism. To protesters, Floyd's pleadings for his life embodied the suffering of many other Black police suspects slain over the years -- most with less dramatic video evidence.
In some quarters, the trial of Chauvin carries the weight of all the police killings that never led to criminal charges or convictions against the officers involved.
Yet Minneapolis attorney Abigail Cerra and other lawyers said that the history of systemic racism and police brutality will not be discussed at this trial, nor will the jury hear statistics about how force is more likely to be used against a Black or Indigenous person in Minneapolis.
Did Chauvin's actions kill?
If prosecutors try to give weight to the fact that Chauvin is white and Floyd was Black, she expects the defense will object and the judge will sustain the objections.
"When someone says racism is on trial, white supremacy is on trial, I understand why they say that and metaphorically, I agree with them. … But none of that is going to be discussed at the trial at all," said Cerra, who sits on the Minneapolis Police Conduct Oversight Commission.
Instead, she added, the questions of the trial will be whether Chauvin's actions killed Floyd and whether he acted as a reasonable officer would with the knowledge he had at the time.
"It's difficult to put systemic racism on trial, especially with a single officer," said Andrew Gordon, deputy director of the Legal Rights Center in Minneapolis. "To really hold systemic racism writ large accountable, you need to talk about the judges and the county attorney's office and the fact that Derek Chauvin had done similar things to other people over the course of a long career. … It's almost impossible to put that on trial."
Last month, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill ruled that two incidents in which Chauvin used a neck or head restraint on a civilian could be introduced as evidence in the trial, though several others cannot be disclosed.
"Part of the argument that a community member would make and even I would make, especially, is a lot of that misconduct was directed towards communities of color, but I don't know that you're going to hear a prosecutor in this case make that explicit connection at the trial … because they don't have to," said Gordon, explaining that there's no legal need for the prosecution to prove that Chauvin had racial bias.
Still, attorneys have grilled a parade of potential jurors about their views on Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter and racial bias in the criminal justice system over the past nine days.
"It's your belief that discrimination exists and it's bad, and that as a result of that discrimination Black and other minorities do not receive equal treatment -- you would agree with that?" defense attorney Eric Nelson asked a white potential juror, probing her answers about racial bias on a juror questionnaire.
After she said yes, Nelson continued, "So the question becomes … is that going to affect your judgment of this case? This case is not about race at all, for example; it's a question of police practice and cause of death."
The potential juror told him no, but Nelson ultimately struck her from the jury.
A Black man who said he faced daily discrimination was also dismissed by the defense.
Narrow focus in court
Hamline University law Prof. David Schultz questioned whether, at the trial's end, deliberating jurors would feel pressure to base their verdict on sending a message to society, especially with the potential for riots if Chauvin is acquitted.
"If they feel like at the end of the day they have to make this a trial about racism in America or racism in Minneapolis, at that point this is no longer a fair trial, they're not really considering the facts of the case and it's turned into something else," he said.
Schultz added that that could be grounds for an appeal if Chauvin is convicted. For the prosecution, he noted: "I think what they want to do is figure out a subtle way of making it about racism but without making it so obvious that it runs the risk of tainting the trial or leading to a mistrial."
Given the limitations of the trial to address systemic racism, activists are vowing to continue pressing for broader structural changes outside the court system.
But they still believe a guilty verdict for Chauvin is necessary.
He would be the first white officer convicted in Minnesota for the killing of a Black person while on police duty. The only officer found guilty of murder for a fatal police shooting was Mohamed Noor, a Black officer who killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a white woman, in 2017.
"Why is the justice system within this state showing our families that the only life that was valued enough happened to be the white woman that was murdered by a minority man?" asked Toshira Garraway, who founded Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence. "There's no equality. There's no justice for minority people here in Minnesota and around the United States."
Civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong said people shouldn't be under an illusion that a conviction would solve systemic racism.
"However, it would signal to white officers that they are just as likely to be held accountable as an officer of color who killed someone, and that message has not come across," she said.
As an attorney, Levy Armstrong acknowledged that the legal system is set up to look at a case like this in a vacuum. But she believes the problem is much bigger.
"I think that it's important for people to understand that although one officer right now is on trial, this is not just a case of one or four bad apples operating within Minneapolis police, but their conduct happened inside of a broader culture that has been allowed to get away with the use of excessive force, violating people's civil rights and killing people with impunity," she said.
While society wants healing, the question posed in the trial, said Osler, is not the same one being asked in the streets about police treatment of Black citizens: "What are we going to do about racial violence?"

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: CAUSE OF DEATH IS CENTRAL TO PROSECUTION, DEFENSE CASES

Full text: What killed George Floyd during an encounter with Minneapolis police last May is at the heart of the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin, which resumes Monday morning with opening statements and the start of witness testimony.
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office ruled Floyd's cause of death cardiac arrest, Floyd's family attorneys believe he died of asphyxiation and Chauvin's attorney has argued that he succumbed to a drug overdose and pre-existing health issues.
"Clearly there is a cause of death issue here -- in fact, it is highly contested," Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill previously said as he presided over the case.
Some veteran defense attorneys have said Chauvin should be acquitted if asphyxiation can't be proven, given prosecutors' focus on Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.
But prosecutors don't have to prove that Chauvin's actions alone caused Floyd's death, according to Minnesota's guidelines for jury instructions in criminal cases. According to the state and the defense's proposed jury instructions,
" 'To cause' means to be a substantial causal factor in causing the death. … The fact that other causes contribute to the death does not relieve the defendant of criminal liability."
Doctors and scientists who study the cardiovascular and respiratory systems say they are complex, intimately interlinked and crucial to the heart's function.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
"Anytime the neck is interfered with, I think the first thing people see or think is that your breathing is being interfered with, and that can be true," said Dr. David Penning, an assistant professor of biology at Missouri Southern State University. "But you do have big important veins and arteries [in the neck], and those also are susceptible to those same forces or pressure … ," he said.
Penning and cardiologists Dr. Geoffrey Barnes, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, and Dr. Jonathan Marmur, a professor and chief of cardiology at the State University of New York Downstate Health Sciences University, spoke generally about the relationship between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. They did not interpret the findings of Floyd's autopsy or determine his cause of death. "Breathing difficulties must be taken with the utmost seriousness …," Marmur said. "Untreated respiratory arrest will result in cardiac arrest and death."
Floyd's May 25 arrest was widely broadcast via a bystander's Facebook video, which conveyed to many observers that he died of asphyxiation as he repeatedly declared, "I can't breathe," while handcuffed and pinned stomach-down in the street under Chauvin's knee. Officer J. Alexander Kueng knelt on his back while officer Thomas Lane knelt and held onto his legs out of view of the video. Officer Tou Thao kept angry bystanders at bay.
On June 1, Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker ruled that Floyd, 46, died of cardiopulmonary arrest, sparking widespread public anger. Two days later, the county spent $4,325 to install emergency fencing around Baker's office downtown. The barricade remains.
Baker found that Floyd's cause of death was "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." He also listed hardening and thickening of the artery walls, heart disease and drug use as "other significant conditions." Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd's system.
Attorneys for Floyd's family commissioned a private autopsy that found he died of asphyxiation. Family attorney Ben Crump said at a June news conference that Baker went to "great length" to obscure Floyd's cause of death, and that disclosing the toxicology results was "an attempt to assassinate his character."
While Baker ruled the manner of death a homicide, an act caused by another person, it did little to quell the backlash.
The cause of Floyd's death is already emerging as an intensely divisive topic in the community. "With [Hennepin County Attorney] Mike Freeman and Dr. Andrew Baker at the helm, it appears, once again, systemic racism, white privilege, and collusion will in the day [sic]," a Wisconsin resident wrote in a letter addressed to Freeman, Baker and several others and obtained through a data practices request. "… the ENTIRE WORLD had access to the video which CLEARLY shows a man's life being taken by a thug in blue and the medical examiner comes up with 'underlying health conditions.' " Another person sent Baker a letter emblazoned with "I can't breath" [sic] three times, "Coverup" and "Time to Retire" on the envelope.
Penning is among a group of scientists who have debunked the long-held belief that snakes fatally asphyxiate animals constricted in their coils. Other scientists published two breakthrough studies in 2012 and 2015 finding that snakes killed their prey by using pressure to stop the flow of blood through the heart, causing circulatory arrest before the animal ran out of oxygen. Penning has continued to advance such studies, which aren't divorced from human biology. A 2017 study on people dying in grain elevators cited the 2015 paper.
Penning described the cardiovascular system as a series of rivers and streams; blocking flow in one area changes where blood travels and pools, sometimes to catastrophic effect.
"It's a really confusing system, and any effect in one area can lead to things you might not have expected," Penning said. "Anytime you apply force or pressure to the neck you're going to potentially interfere with breathing and the cardiovascular system, and of those two, the cardiovascular system is more sensitive …"
A lack of oxygen can damage or kill the heart muscle, triggering an abnormal electrical signal that causes cardiac arrest, said Barnes, a specialist at the University of Michigan's Frankel Cardiovascular Center.
Pressure on the neck can also cause blood pressure to drop and reduce blood flow to the heart, possibly resulting in a cardiac arrest, Marmur said. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued in court filings that Floyd was resisting arrest and posed a possible threat to officers. He pointed to Baker's findings that no bruises were found on Floyd's neck and back as proof that his client is innocent. Floyd likely died of a drug overdose, Nelson wrote, adding that he had pre-existing health conditions and was positive for COVID-19.
"If [Floyd] were found dead at home alone and no other apparent causes [sic], this could be acceptable to call an [overdose]," said the notes of a meeting between Baker and prosecutors that Nelson filed with the court. "… I am not saying this killed him."
"Put simply, Mr. Floyd could not breathe because he had ingested a lethal dose of fentanyl and, possibly, a speedball," Nelson wrote.
The possibility of cardiac arrest in Floyd's death was not lost on some. "When doing the autopsy on Mr. Floyd please do not neglect the fact that a knee on the carotid artery can cause a fatal asystole or other arrhythmia -- also a fatal stroke," a registered nurse from Pennsylvania wrote in a letter addressed to Baker.
Kueng, Lane and Thao are to be tried in one trial Aug. 23. They are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: THE CHARGES

Full text: THE CHARGES
What is second-degree unintentional murder?
For a conviction, the state's prosecutors must show beyond a reasonable doubt that Derek Chauvin caused George Floyd's death. This is the most serious charge and carries a presumed sentence in this case of 10¾ to 15 years, according to state sentencing guidelines. The cause of Floyd's death is likely to be a major focus of the trial.
What is third-degree murder?
Third-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove that someone caused the death of another "by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life." Legal experts note that the definition of "depraved mind" is murky -- as is the legal line between "depraved mind" and the "culpable negligence" standard for manslaughter. Historically, third-degree murder has been used to prosecute drug dealers who sold deadly products but weren't planning to kill specific individuals. Third-degree murder also carries a presumptive sentence in this case of 10¾ to 15 years, according to state sentencing guidelines.
What is second-degree manslaughter?
In order to convict Chauvin of second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors must show beyond a reasonable doubt that he was "culpably negligent" and took an "unreasonable risk" with Floyd's life when he restrained him and that his actions put Floyd at risk of death or great harm. Prosecutors do not have to prove that Chauvin's actions intended to cause Floyd's death, only that his actions put Floyd at risk of death or great bodily harm. This charge carries a presumptive sentence of 41 to 57 months.
What protections do police officers have related to use of force while on duty?
Jurors have to determine only whether Chauvin is guilty or not guilty on the charges filed against him. But during the trial, jurors will hear about special protections state law gives to police officers, allowing them to use force that a "reasonable peace officer in the same situation would believe to be necessary." The state will have to prove that the force Chauvin used was unreasonable under the circumstances.

Full text: The public got its first glance at the key figures during jury selection in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who faces murder and manslaughter charges in the death of George Floyd. Here is a look at who will be in the courtroom, along with quick bios of each juror. Jurors will be referred to in court and below by their assigned jury numbers.
PETER CAHILL
JUDGE
Cahill, a Hennepin County District judge since 2007. His experience is largely in criminal court, along with stints in juvenile and drug courts. Cahill has worked both as a public defender and prosecutor in Hennepin County, as well as in private practice. Before he was named to the bench, he was the top deputy to Hennepin County Attorney Amy Klobuchar, now a U.S. senator.
DEREK CHAUVIN
DEFENDANT
Chauvin is a former Minneapolis police officer charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25 death of George Floyd. In a video shot by a bystander that quickly went viral worldwide, Chauvin was shown planting his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd pleaded for his life.
ERIC NELSON
DEFENSE ATTORNEY
Nelson is an attorney for the Bloomington-based firm Halberg Criminal Defense and has practiced law in Minnesota since 2001. Nelson is known for representing Amy Senser, wife of former Minnesota Viking Joe Senser, in a 2011 criminal vehicular homicide case. Senser was convicted and sentenced to 41 months in prison, then released less than 2½ years later.
MATTHEW G. FRANK
PROSECUTOR
Frank has served as manager of the Criminal Division of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office for the last 14 years. His signature can be found on most court filings in the case. Before joining the Attorney General's Office 21 years ago, he worked as a public defender in Anoka and Sherburne counties and as an assistant county attorney in Wright County.
THE JURY
A panel of 12 jurors and three alternates has been seated for the trial of Derek Chauvin. One of the three alternates will be excused once the trial begins on Monday. Six jurors are people of color and nine are white. Nine jurors are women and six are men.
2. A white man in his 20s. He is from Minneapolis and works as a chemist. Because of his profession, he said, "I consider myself a pretty logical person … I rely on facts and logic and what's in front of me. Opinion and facts are important distinctions for me."
9. A multirace woman in her 20s originally from northern Minnesota. She said she was "superexcited" to receive jury summons because she believes it's her civic duty. She said she was eager to serve regardless of the case, but especially in Chauvin's trial, given the gravity of it.
19. A white man in his 30s. He works as an auditor and was chosen for the jury after expressing confidence that he could be fair. He said he can examine the evidence "from a viewpoint of the law." He served in a jury five years ago and was dismissed as an alternate.
27. A Black man in his 30s. He immigrated to the United States 14 years ago and went to school in Nebraska and moved to Minnesota in 2012. He works in information technology and lives with his wife and dog. He speaks multiple languages.
44. A white woman in her 50s. She is a single mother who works as a high-level executive in the nonprofit sector focused on health care. She acknowledged sympathy for Floyd and the officers, saying, "Everyone's lives are changed."
52. A Black man in his 30s. He said he has seen the bystander video of Floyd's arrest and that "I don't think [Chauvin] had any intention of harming anybody, but somebody did die." The man said he could look at the case from an objective point of view.
55. A white woman in her 50s. She lives outside Minneapolis and works as an executive assistant in clinical health care. She said she has viewed the bystander video, but she wrote in her questionnaire: "I couldn't watch it in full, because it was too disturbing to me."
79. A Black man in his 40s. He has been a victim of home burglary in the past and the police came to help. He believes minorities are often arrested but disagrees with the concept of "defunding" law enforcement and said, "the police do a lot. … I would trust the police."
86. A multirace woman in her 40s. She is an organizational consultant who helps corporations improve personnel practices and efficiency. She is married with a son. Asked about the settlement, the woman said, "I don't think that declares guilt one way or the other."
89. A white woman in her 50s. She works as a nurse and lives in Edina. She assured the court she could judge the evidence fairly despite having seen portions of the viral video of Floyd's arrest and after hearing about the city settlement.
91. A Black woman in her 60s. She is a grandmother and volunteers helping children in need with their homework. She said she started watching the video of Floyd's arrest but stopped because "it just wasn't something that I needed to see."
92. A white woman in her 40s. She lives in the suburbs and works in the insurance industry. She has viewed the bystander video and was aware of the city settlement but said neither would stop her from being fair and objective as a juror.
96. A white woman in her 50s. She has worked in customer service and said she is an animal lover, "especially dogs." She said she saw the bystander video of Floyd's arrest, but said that she could presume Chauvin innocent as the law requires her to do.
118. A white woman in her 20s. She is a newlywed and a social worker in Wright County whose clients are coping with mental health difficulties. She was unwavering in her confidence that she could judge only the evidence presented in the trial.
131. A white man in his 20s. He is an accountant who is married and said he could weigh the evidence fairly. He said that he understands why athletes kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in America, but he wishes they would do so in a different manner.

Full text: WHAT TO KNOW
What is the schedule for the Derek Chauvin trial?
Opening statements are slated for Monday. The court day is expected to start at 9 a.m. with a discussion of pending legal issues. Jurors arrive at 9:15 a.m., testimony starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 4:30 p.m. During the trial, sessions could continue until 7:30 p.m. The trial is expected to last several weeks.
Where is the trial?
It is in a courtroom on the 18th floor of the Hennepin County Government Center at 300 S. 6th Street in downtown Minneapolis.
Where will most of the news media be?
The court has designated a media center in the 625 Building, across the street from the government center, where up to 40 members of the local, national and international media can watch the proceedings via video feed. Two members of the news media will be allowed inside the courtroom and will be rotated daily: one reporter for print and one for television.
How can I watch the trial?
A video and audio feed of the proceedings will be provided by Court TV. The Star Tribune will offer a livestream each day or proceedings from previous days on startribune.com. All staff coverage of the trial will be offered free of charge during the trial as a public service.
What measures will be in place to ensure the safety of Chauvin and other trial participants?
The Government Center will remain closed to the public, including people who work there except for those involved with the trial and a limited number of building support staff. The defendant and everyone else participating in the trial will arrive and leave through secured areas and be escorted to the courtroom.
Why are cameras allowed in the courtroom?
In November, Judge Peter Cahill ordered video and audio of the court proceedings to be livestreamed in order to fulfill "the defendant's constitutional right to a public trial and the media's and public's constitutional rights of access to criminal trials." He cited immense global interest in the case, limited courthouse space and COVID-19 restrictions. It is the first time a high-profile trial in a Minnesota state court will be broadcast live.

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: JUDGMENT OF HISTORY ; CHAUVIN CASE TO ADD TO NATIONAL RACIAL LEGACY

Author: REID FORGRAVE; Rao, Maya

Full text: George Floyd pleading for his life under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has become a defining moment of our time.
What began 10 months ago at the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue has transformed into nothing less than an American reckoning on justice, racial equity, the proper role of law enforcement and the historical wrongs society has perpetrated on Black people.
Monday morning, that moment leads to the 18th-floor courtroom of the Hennepin County Government Center, where a jury will begin to hear a murder and manslaughter case against since-fired police officer Derek Chauvin.
The trial itself is about what happened that May evening, but it will also be a vessel into which a splintered society places its rage, anxieties and hopes. Like the trial after Rodney King's beating, like the trial after Emmett Till's murder, like the Scottsboro Boys' trial, this case will be viewed as another chapter -- perhaps a turning point -- in America's racial history.
"Everything is riding on the outcome of the trial," said Keith Mayes, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's Department of African
American and African Studies. "Yes, Chauvin is on trial, and it's about the Floyd murder. … But an argument can be made it's about all the other folks that didn't receive justice, too. That's why a conviction is necessary for us to reimagine what a future can look like, because these cases continue to happen until the police are thoroughly reformed."
Still, while some look at Chauvin as emblematic of law enforcement as an institution that's misguided at best or racist at worst, others see what happened last Memorial Day as an anomaly: that Floyd's death was the rare exception instead of proof that police are the bad guys.
"I try in my head to better understand that broad-brush mentality, but I have a hard time," said Tim Leslie, the Dakota County sheriff. "If a plumber gets arrested for DUI, are all plumbers drunks? If a pilot crashes a plane, are all pilots incompetent? No. Yet Chauvin does that, he murders somebody, and all law enforcement needs to be reformed. Is that the same?"
History on video
When Mayes saw the Floyd video, the 53-year-old professor had a visceral reaction: What if that were me?
"You almost see yourself lying on the ground with the police officer's knee on your own neck," Mayes said. "You can't help but … be engulfed in this kind of anger and rage and disappointment in the system that continues to allow this to happen."
Growing up in Harlem, Mayes had two distinct types of interactions with police: One with housing police, who were familiar and respectful, and the other with city police, who were feared. Decades later, even as an author with an Ivy League degree, those feelings linger.
After Floyd's death, Mayes joined protests and paid respects at 38th and Chicago. That's how he processed it: by sharing his grief with the grief of the community. He thought about George Floyd, but he also thought about Philando Castile, and Jamar Clark, and Amadou Diallo, the Guinean immigrant killed by New York police while Mayes lived in New York.
"I put this incident along this spectrum of other incidents," he said, "where police either assaulted or killed Black people. And they just get stacked up."
Heroes or villains
For police officers, the national debate about where the profession falls short has often felt jarring and unfair.
"We've disappointed some of our constituency -- that's the bottom line," said Leslie, the sheriff in Dakota County. "We have to take a look in the mirror and figure that out."
The past year has been an emotional whirlwind for police. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, they were painted as heroes; after Floyd died, they were painted as villains.
Leslie has tried to think deeply about the issues Floyd's death brought up. He's read books such as "How to Be an Antiracist" and "Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man." He's hired a community outreach and equity coordinator, and he's focused more on deputies' mental health.
But Leslie has been in law enforcement for four decades. He knows innumerable police officers who went into the field for honorable reasons. He knows policing is an emotional profession to begin with: seeing dead bodies, dealing with people in crisis, always remaining on edge. The past year has made it more so.
"We're in a really tough spot right now," he said. "We're supposed to deal with people with mental illness, chemical addiction, all sorts of family drama, poverty, undereducated. These are not police problems. These are social problems. We're trying to be everything for everyone, and I'm not sure we're able to do that without disappointing some people sometimes."
Global impact
Chauvin's knee became a symbol of Black oppression worldwide: in Australia and Japan, in France and Germany, in Kazakhstan and Indonesia.
The case "has really become a global indictment of police forces," said Brenda Stevenson, a professor of history and African American studies at UCLA. "This is now representative of what happens everywhere -- at least, that's what many people believe. … People are really watching to see if the U.S. can get it right this time."
Thabi Myeni, a 23-year-old law student in Johannesburg, South Africa, had been to plenty of protests before last spring -- mostly over racial equity in tuition fees.
When Myeni saw the video of Floyd's death, she thought it would be another example of racial injustice going unnoticed. "I had no idea it would spark a global movement," she said.
What changed for her was when South Africa's ruling party decried Floyd's killing as a "heinous murder." It struck Myeni as hypocrisy. While Americans protested Floyd's death, South Africans were protesting the death of a man named Collins Khosa. Khosa lived in Johannesburg's poor Alexandria township, and he was beaten to death by soldiers who said Khosa had been drinking alcohol in public, a violation of COVID-19 lockdown rules.
After Floyd's death, Myeni organized a march to Parliament. Racial justice protests were sweeping more than 60 countries around the world, but in South Africa, they felt especially resonant. It has been nearly three decades since apartheid ended, and yet institutionalized segregation still has a long tail in South Africa. It was, she thought, no different from America's legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.
"These things are transnational in nature, the global nature of Black oppression," she said. "I think of America as I think of South Africa, where the government -- the people of power, the people of privilege -- don't want to acknowledge racism still exists."
Policing questions
For some, Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck told a story of America's history of racism. Calls for an overhaul of policing -- to defund or even abolish police -- also functioned as calls to disrupt America's power structures.
The reason Floyd's death had more impact than other instances of police violence is simple, said James Mulvaney, a law enforcement professor who worked in New York's Division of Human Rights. Technology made Floyd's death immediate, graphic and personal.
"We're no longer viewing these things through a telescope -- we're witnessing them in our living rooms," Mulvaney said. "America watched George Floyd die at our house."
In the months since, police reform has become a heated topic in Minnesota and around the country.
Brendan Cox, the former Albany, N.Y., police chief who now works as Director of Policing Strategies at the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion National Support Bureau, believes the message needs to be the system cannot be fixed by police alone.
"If the community does not trust us not only as individuals but as a system, then we really can't do our job," he said.
Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City who has written extensively about police training, has been frustrated with the national conversation about policing after Floyd's death. Too much has been driven by loud voices instead of insightful ones, she said. The better discussion, she believes, should have been about centralizing America's police system. Each state having a single police force would help funding and streamline training.
Chauvin "is a classic example of someone who should not be on the job, who was poorly trained," Haberfeld said. "I didn't see all the unrest [Floyd's death] would trigger, but in a way to me I was waiting for something of that nature. I've been writing about this for 20 years. And nobody's been listening."
The cataclysmic national moment that began 10 months ago at the corner of 38th and Chicago will not come to a tidy end at the conclusion of Chauvin's trial. The three other officers at the scene are scheduled to be tried in August, and Floyd's death is certain to reverberate much longer than that.
But Martin Luther King III, the oldest son of the civil rights icon, said he believes the impact of this trial cannot be overstated. An acquittal would mean our criminal justice system must be rethought, he said.
"It may set a tone for how people perceive whether justice can be achieved, specifically for Black people," King said. "Nothing brings this young man's life back. … But his legacy can be that his tragic death mobilized people all over the nation and the world so that we don't go backward, but we as a world community go forward in terms of addressing racial issues."

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: NOOR VERDICT SHADOWS HIGH-STAKES PROSECUTION

Author: Jany, Libor

Full text: Derek Chauvin is the second Minneapolis police officer to stand trial for murder in the last few years, but that is where the similarities end.
Former officer Mohamed Noor became the first policeman in recent state history to be charged with murder -- and one of the few nationwide -- after he fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond while responding to her 911 call in 2017. Like Chauvin, Noor was fired from the department.
University of Minnesota sociology professor Michelle Phelps found herself glued to the Noor trial and is following the Chauvin proceedings with equally intense interest as opening statements begin Monday.
Already, the differences between the two cases are stark. For one thing, she says, this time around the city's police department seems to be on trial along with Chauvin, who faces murder and manslaughter charges in the death of George Floyd.
"I'm guessing that we'll see in the trial critiques of MPD more broadly," she said. "Activists have called for not just this criminal legal system response for the perpetrators, but also broader changes to prevent this from happening again."
Noor was convicted in Damond's death and sentenced to 12½ years in prison.
Floyd's death quickly became a watershed moment in the city's history, leading to widespread unrest, a state human rights investigation and calls to defund, or even abolish, the police department. It has also forced city leaders to confront the issues of race relations and police brutality head-on.
To retired Hennepin County Judge Pamela Alexander, the issue of race is as much a part of this case as it was the Noor trial, where a Black man born in Somalia was charged with killing a white Australian woman. More important, she said, it is impossible to view Floyd's death outside of the context of the long and painful history of police brutality against Black Americans.
"That's been going on for hundreds of years, whether or not people see it," Alexander said. "Who is going to be accountable for that?"
The charges against Noor came amid heightened scrutiny over deadly police encounters in places like Baton Rouge, La., Baltimore and Los Angeles. With the Chauvin case, Minneapolis again finds itself under a harsh international spotlight.
According to former Hennepin County Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty, the trial will be closely watched by police reform advocates, for whom the Noor trial only highlighted a double standard in the criminal justice system that historically showed little interest in prosecuting white police officers who killed Black men.
"What they saw was a Black officer being really aggressively prosecuted for second-degree murder and other charges," said Moriarty, who has built a loyal following on Twitter with her minute-by-minute analysis of the Chauvin case.
"The comparison is really a slap in the face to our community, because what we see is white people who kill Black people get off," said Todd Gramenz, a leader of Black Lives Matter-St. Paul.
The two cases differ down to the descriptions of each victim killed, said defense attorney Paul Applebaum.
Prosecutors "had the benefit, in Noor's case, of somebody who had been angelized: She was a yoga teacher, she was an attractive middle-aged white woman, so that story wrote itself," said Applebaum, pointing out that the defense intends to focus its counterattack on Floyd's past drug use and brushes with the law. "It's a tougher sell when you try to humanize someone like Floyd who had his issues, who had a background, and those are all things that people shouldn't take into account, but they do."
In the Chauvin case, state Attorney General Keith Ellison made the unprecedented decision to take the lead in the prosecution from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which had secured a conviction of Noor, but had previously faced criticism for failing to charge other officers who used deadly force.
There is another important way the Noor case has loomed over the current trial, which in a first for the state is livestreamed for the world to see. The Noor trial included pretrial debate about whether someone can be convicted of third-degree murder if their deadly act is aimed at a single person and whether the reckless nature of the act alone can establish a "depraved" mind-set. The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear Noor's appeal of his third-degree murder conviction, which could have implications for the Chauvin case.
Other differences are less obvious. For instance, prosecutors in the Chauvin case have not faced the same lack of cooperation from potential officer witnesses, who in the lead-up to the Noor trial refused repeated requests to provide pretrial statements on the union's advice, forcing the county attorney's office to issue dozens of subpoenas.
Michael Friedman, who previously served on a police disciplinary review panel, said that while fatal police shootings are comparatively rare, Chauvin's actions reminded him of "the most common reason for excessive force that I saw -- was not responding to someone who was physically challenging, but what I would call retaliatory control."
He noted examples like when someone flees police, or they are resisting authority or what was alleged in Floyd's case, that he refused to be brought into the squad car. Friedman said such instances can bring out a certain mentality among many officers, particularly of the earlier generation, that they pile on force as a means of retaliation to maintain control.
Legal analysts and early court filings suggest that cause of death will be a central theme in the Chauvin case. Whereas even Noor's defense team acknowledged that he shot Damond because he feared for his life after she approached the squad car, attorneys for Chauvin have signaled their intent to concentrate on Floyd's past drug use and underlying health conditions. The defense is arguing that these other factors resulted in his death -- not Chauvin's knee. The presiding judge has said that for the second-degree murder charge, prosecutors must prove only that Chauvin's conduct was a "substantial causal factor" in Floyd's death.
Throughout the Noor trial, prosecutors sought to paint him as an undisciplined rookie who had violated his training at the Police Academy. They also released parts of his field training evaluations, showing that some of his superiors had concerns about his conduct, fueling online chatter that the department had lowered its standards in hiring Noor -- characterizations that his backers rejected as racist stereotypes.
"There was a lack of training on Noor's part, and he could not point to any training that he did, but with Chauvin -- as freaky and grotesque as it sounds -- he's going to say, this is what we were taught to do," said Applebaum, the defense attorney.
Chauvin's defense attorneys have argued in pretrial motions and other filings that the use of force followed the department's then-policy on dealing with uncooperative suspects. Shortly after Floyd's death, Minneapolis police changed its use-of-force policy to prohibit the use of chokeholds and neck restraints -- like the one Chauvin used on Floyd -- under a deal negotiated between the city and the state.
Greg Hestness, a former MPD deputy chief, said that all officers who use deadly force are judged by the standard of what a "reasonable officer" would do in similar circumstances. But, he said, Chauvin's actions will be judged by a different standard than in Noor's case, which involved a firearm, in part because shootings involve split-second decisions that juries are more reluctant to second-guess.
"The Noor case was just a reckless discharge of a firearm that took a life. Chauvin's acts were not sort of knee-jerk, it wasn't a quick reaction, there were eight to nine minutes there," said Hestness, adding that no footage exists of Damond's killing, but prosecutors will rely on the widely seen bystander video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. "I mean, to this day, I don't know what he was doing kneeling on that man for eight to nine minutes."

Full text: Restaurants were on the front lines of philanthropy long before the pandemic hit.
The dining industry is often the first stop when nonprofit groups are in fundraising mode, and chefs and restaurateurs consistently donate time, money and expertise.
Now, despite being squeezed by shutdowns, capacity restrictions and a jittery customer base, that charitable impulse has only intensified as Twin Cities restaurants lead the way, especially on the growing issue of food insecurity.
The need is definitely there. Second Harvest Heartland reports that one in nine Minnesotans experiences hunger. Just last year, the regional food bank provided assistance to more than a half-million people.
So restaurants are doing what they have always done: stepping up to the plate. The examples of generosity, all infused with compassion and ingenuity, are seemingly endless.
It's Brian and Sarah Ingram of their aptly named Hope Breakfast Bar in St. Paul, turning their restaurant's kitchen into a community kitchen and feeding thousands of people a week, for free, during the civil unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd.
It's Cafe Racer Kitchen chef/owner Luis Patino ramping up his already extraordinary Break Bread Free Meal effort -- which serves free meals on the last
Monday of each month -- by making free meals available to anyone who calls his Minneapolis restaurant.
And it's Savory Bake House co-owners Sandra Sherva and Max Okray, who kept their south Minneapolis bakery closed last summer and instead focused on making breakfasts and dinners for people living in encampments in nearby city parks.
At the center of much of this philanthropic activity is Second Harvest Heartland and its Minnesota Central Kitchen initiative.
The prepared meals program is a first for Second Harvest, and combines its enormous food rescue operations and fundraising prowess with a diverse group of dining industry players. The result? Delicious and nutritious restaurant-quality meals that are routed to Minnesotans via a distribution network of Second Harvest partners.
The output has been nothing short of astonishing, with more than 1.32 million meals produced since its inception in mid-March 2020.
The healing powers of food
Minnesota Central Kitchen started as a hastily formed collaboration between Chowgirls Catering, the Bachelor Farmer, Restaurant Alma, Second Harvest, the Good Acre food hub and the meal distribution organization Loaves and Fishes. The partnership moved quickly to leverage donated ingredients from restaurants emptying their pantries as Gov. Tim Walz closed the state's dining rooms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"It was people saying, 'What can we do?' because it's in their bones to serve people and cook food," said Emily Paul, director of Minnesota Central Kitchen. "They have the facilities, and the workforce, and the desire to serve. Within a few days, we had produced 2,500 meals. We were building the plane while we were flying it."
That first kitchen eventually grew to 14, and now there are nine facilities working together to turn out 20,000 meals per week. The facilities run the gamut, from a community college to a natural foods co-op. They're staffed by nearly 200 Twin Cities restaurant workers, all earning a paycheck after being furloughed by their employers.
"It takes a village, no joke," said Paul. "This is a community that sees the power that food has to heal people, to break down barriers and to bring us together. That's why they do what they do. They couldn't, as a community, stand on the sidelines and hope that everything will be OK."
Looking ahead, Paul definitely sees Minnesota Central Kitchen moving beyond its initial response to the pandemic crisis.
"Prepared meal needs are real," she said. "They existed before COVID, they became acute during COVID and they will exist after COVID. Every single one of our partners has said that they want to keep doing this. They've all said, 'This has been transformative to our business, our staff and our values. Going forward, we want to bake this into our company.' "
Feeding Minnesota's tribal communities
One of those busy Minnesota Central Kitchen partners was the Indigenous Food Lab at the Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis. The Native foodways education and training center is part of the nonprofit arm of the Sioux Chef, the groundbreaking work of Sean Sherman and Dana Thompson.
The Sioux Chef's 2020 narrative mirrors that of many others: The pandemic pretty much shut down their for-profit catering business (their Owamni restaurant is opening on the downtown Minneapolis riverfront this spring). Then George Floyd was killed.
"Homelessness was exploding everywhere around us, and we started talking to people about how we could use this kitchen to alleviate some of that hunger," said Thompson. "There's a lot of suffering. It's really scary, and a huge blight on our nation."
Their solution was to spend the summer months sending hundreds of meals out the door every day.
"Then we started moving toward how we could feed tribal communities," said Thompson.
That involved creating frozen meals -- up to 10,000 per week -- that cater to the needs of nine tribal communities across the state. Sherman and his team cook with Indigenous ingredients, and their menus change with the seasons. Recent dishes have included bison meatloaf with roasted squash, bison tamales with black beans, smoked duck pozole, fried wild rice with cranberry meatballs and walleye cakes with pepitas pesto and root vegetables.
"It's so humbling to be part of this, and we're so grateful to have built a team of primarily Indigenous people," Thompson said. "It's been exhausting, and challenging, in so many ways. But really rewarding."
While the program is still operating in crisis mode, Thompson said they're also looking ahead.
"The future of this is multifaceted," she said. "We have a cool program going with the Prairie Island Indian community where we're working to train their staff so they can do this meal production themselves. The recipes, the logistics. We're creating an entrepreneurial generator, because every tribal community is interested in these resources."
A grassroots effort
When the pandemic closed Minnesota's public schools last March, Mike Willenbring, chef/co-owner of Manger Restaurant and Wine Bar, took a look at the elementary school near his Bayport restaurant. He discovered that 40% of the student body qualified for free or reduced-price lunches.
"That was pretty eye-opening," he said. "That's when I knew that there was a need right here, in this community."
That led Willenbring and his wife and business partner, Nicole Willenbring, to do what they do best: feed people. A banner went up outside the restaurant announcing free lunches, and a cooler on the restaurant's patio was stocked with uncomplicated grab-and-go meals, no questions asked.
"We wanted to do it in a way that wouldn't make people feel awkward," said Mike Willenbring. "It was supercool because we saw a lot of the same families come in every day, and they'd knock on the window and wave to us, and say 'Thank you.' "
The kitchen's inventory determined the menu, but the format usually included a sandwich, a piece of fruit and a cookie, bag of chips or other snack.
Others quickly rallied to the cause. Customers donated money to help cover the Willenbrings' costs. Local businesses contributed, too; the folks at Candyland in nearby Stillwater regularly supplied apples, popcorn and other goodies.
Manger ended up supplying about 800 lunches over a two-month period, and the Willenbrings discovered that their generosity did not go unnoticed.
"We ended up getting an uptick in takeout business, because people wanted to support us," said Mike Willenbring. "That wasn't our intention, but it helped us during a difficult time and also allowed us to keep doing the lunches. I can't say that 2020 was a great year, by any means. But it made us realize what our priorities should be, and need to be."
Looking ahead
As the pandemic continues, so do restaurant-driven efforts to combat food insecurity.
One example is the Steller Union Family Meals Project. The just-announced partnership, between the Steller Kindness Project and chef Yia Vang, will allow consumers to participate in a unique buy-one/give-one food drive.
When diners order a family-style meal from Vang's Union Hmong Kitchen, the St. Paul restaurant will donate an identical meal to a family in need.
Deliveries began March 27 and will be managed by volunteers from the Steller Kindness Project, which was founded in 2017 by Minneapolis hair salon owner Katie Steller. (Steller is also behind the Red Chair Project, which provides haircuts and supplies to people experiencing homelessness.)
"Katie and I are looking forward to collaborating on this," Vang said in a statement. "I want to honor the words my dad often repeats: 'When we say something is mine, we have less. When we say something is ours, we have more.' If we expand our definition of family to include our neighbors, we all have more."

Council details plan for E. 38th St.: Included are a business association, homebuying help, street festivals.

Full text: Minneapolis has unveiled a long-range plan to revitalize E. 38th Street, well known as the heart of the South Side Black community before the death of George Floyd last year brought global attention to the corner of 38th and Chicago.
This month, the City Council approved 38th Street Thrive, a 10-year development guide for the 38th Street Cultural District, which stretches from Nicollet to Bloomington Avenue. George Floyd Square sits in the heart of that corridor, but the plan calls for a separate, still undetermined approach to its development.
The intersection of 38th and Chicago is now closed to regular vehicular traffic. For the past 10 months, it has been partitioned from the rest of the city by barricades guarded by protesters trying to leverage control of the street in return for 24 demands.
Thrive gathered community feedback for the square but does not recommend a course of action. According to the plan, area residents are
concerned about an "unprecedented uptick in violence" including gunshots, theft and lack of police response to 911 calls, but they also want the city to reach a consensus with the protesters who authored the demands and preserve Floyd's memorial.
While the neighborhood works out a long-term strategy for the square, the rest of the cultural district can undergo redevelopment that commemorates the South Side's Black history and uplifts residents, said Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins.
North Minneapolis is the city's best known Black community, but there's a reason St. Peter's African Methodist Episcopal Church was planted on the South Side in 1880, the Minneapolis Urban League opened at 38th Street and 4th Avenue, Prince Rogers Nelson attended Central High, and the Spokesman-Recorder is still reporting from the Central neighborhood after nearly 90 years.
Thrive includes launching a business association and signature street festivals over the next three years, financing a capital fund in years four to six, finding a South Side location for the Minnesota African American Heritage Museum and Gallery, and establishing a land trust for African Americans to purchase homes and commercial property in years seven to 10.
The strategic planning guide has no spending targets. It anticipates future funding from public and private sources.
"We certainly recognize that this has become a multicultural community," Jenkins said. "This is about building bridges, reconnecting communities that have been separated by the freeway, to bring that energy, that economic vitality that we see on the west side of 35W."
Halting displacement is at the heart of the plan, she said.
Thrive highlights the evolution of three longtime community organizations: Sabathani Community Center, the Cultural Wellness Center and Kente Circle.
Sabathani, which hosts youth programs, a food pantry and a clothing shelf at 310 E. 38th St., plans to build 48 units of senior housing with rents at 50% of area median income or less. Total development costs are estimated at $11.7 million.
Capital improvements planned for the center include $2 million to $3 million worth of upgrades to the auditorium, heating and cooling, and the roof.
Kente Circle, a mental health agency whose clients are mostly youth of color, plans to unveil a new Cultural Healing and Training Center as part of a 3,000-square-foot renovation and an 8,000-square-foot expansion of its existing space at 345 E. 38th St.
The Cultural Wellness Center, a community health and economic nonprofit at 2025 S. Portland Av., plans to resurrect the Dreamland Caf, which stood at 38th Street and 4th Avenue in the 1930s. One of the first Black-owned businesses in a segregated city, Dreamland and sister club Nacirema ("American" backward) was where local civil rights activists and visiting Black celebrities mingled.
Anthony Taylor of the Cultural Wellness Center said the new Dreamland would be a cooperative incubator for African American entrepreneurs. Its goal, he said, is to fight gentrification by creating economic opportunity for legacy residents while simultaneously upgrading the neighborhood's built environment.
"Minneapolis between 36th and 46th had a significant middle-class Black population that was anchored there until their children in the 1980s began to experience different kinds of economic realities," he said. "Dreamland on 38th is part of a broader concept tied to an African American legacy of economic vitality, which we do not have a narrative for at all."
Project plans include a commercial kitchen, administrative offices and a community event space with rooftop access. The last legislative bonding bill awarded Dreamland $250,000. Construction is slated to begin next spring, Taylor said.
According to local historian Tina Burnside, the once-vibrant South Side neighborhoods declined between the 1980s and 2000s, when crime, crack cocaine and economic hardship closed schools and Black-owned businesses. As white and Black residents moved out, the Hispanic population surpassed both.
Arson and looting that followed the death of Floyd last spring was also heavily concentrated on the South Side. The closure of 38th and Chicago -- and its collateral consequences for Black-owned businesses -- is an unresolved controversy.
During a February news conference, city officials announced they had dedicated more than $10 million to the area of 38th and Chicago. Most of that money has not been spent in the neighborhood, however.
The $10 million breaks down into $5.5 million for the city's Commercial Property Development Fund, which issues competitive grants to businesses in "economically challenged areas" citywide; $4.75 million to reconstruct the intersection in conjunction with bus station improvements over the next two years; and $150,000 for the division of Race and Equity to provide trauma-informed mental health services. It has not yet been distributed.

Ex-Marine is acquitted in fatal shooting: Battlefield trauma, unrest after George Floyd's death cited in judge's ruling.

Full text: Delusions rooted in battlefield trauma and the civil unrest after George Floyd's death led a judge to find a 24-year-old former Marine not guilty by reason of mental illness for breaking into a Shakopee home and fatally shooting a man.
Brady D. Zipoy was acquitted of second-degree intentional murder Wednesday in Scott County District Court and ordered civilly committed to the St. Peter Security Hospital in connection with the killing of 65-year-old Timothy Guion in June.
Based on two psychiatric evaluations, Judge Paula Vraa ruled that Zipoy "did know the nature of his act at the time" when he shot Guion multiple times, but he "was laboring under such a defect of reason ... that he did not understand that his act was wrong."
Therefore, Vraa's order read, the law requires that Zipoy "be excused from criminal liability by reason of mental illness."
County Attorney Ron Hocevar said Thursday, "It's a tough pill to swallow when you have somebody who murdered another individual in cold blood. There is no criminal punishment, but he will receive mental health care."
Hocevar said both evaluations were conducted by highly respected psychologists, and Zipoy's attorney presented "a valid mental illness defense. We do find it sincere."
Zipoy, of Minneapolis, remains jailed ahead of his transfer to the state-operated hospital for treatment until a judge rules him no longer a threat to the community. Hocevar said it's possible Zipoy might never win release, but he called a lifetime of commitment "a remote possibility."
The Prior Lake High School graduate admitted under police questioning that night to killing the man who was a stranger to him, but the court-ordered exams revealed that Zipoy had been suffering from various psychotic episodes connected to politics, religion, Floyd's death that spring and his military service.
Defense attorney Brockton Hunter said Thursday that Zipoy's overseas military service played a large role in his client's mental instability.
"He saw a significant amount of combat ... in which his unit worked with U.S. special operations forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces to drive ISIS" from the northern city of Raqqa, Hunter said. "His commanding officer had nothing but praise for Brady."
Zipoy left the service in 2019, and "when COVID hit [in March 2020] he seemed to decline at a more decreasing rate" because he was unable to attend college and socialize as much, the attorney said.
Then came Floyd's death and the sometimes violent unrest that brought a large response by the National Guard and law enforcement.
"He was being impacted by the helicopters flying overhead constantly," Hunter said. "His delusions started taking control, and he became more and more out of control."
The judge's order spells out Zipoy's actions in the Shakopee neighborhood, which are based on law enforcement investigations and agreed to by the defense, and the conclusions reached by the forensic psychologists who examined him in the months following the killing.
Early in the evening on June 8, Zipoy was smoking marijuana in a friend's basement in the 2400 block of Paha Circle before driving off. He soon returned to the block and parked in the drive of a neighbor's home.
He went inside, shot Guion in the head, chest and elsewhere while several family members were either in the home or just outside. Zipoy contended that he felt threatened when Guion unsnapped a holster holding a gun. Guion's weapon was on the floor next to his body.
A barefoot Zipoy then came outside firing his semiautomatic handgun in the air as he ran toward his friend's home nearby. Zipoy dropped the gun outside and was arrested.
The mission of the court-ordered psychiatric examinations was to determine whether Zipoy understood that what he did was wrong.
A defense doctor was first and found that Zipoy was suffering from schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and likely post-traumatic stress disorder possibly related to his years in the Marines. He told the doctor that his artillery unit spent three months in Syria and "was engaged in active combat," one court filing read.
Zipoy also told the doctor that he quit taking his antidepressant and sleep aid medication because of unspecified side effects.
In the time leading up to the killing, Zipoy exhibited psychotic symptoms of delusions, hallucinations and "impaired thought processes," the doctor wrote.
Specifically, he lost sleep because of anxiety over the unrest following Floyd's death in Minneapolis two weeks earlier. Zipoy said he patrolled his south Minneapolis neighborhood feeling like he was back in Syria.
Zipoy's preoccupations turned to politics and religion. He told of driving toward Washington, D.C., a day before the killing after seeing a photo of President Donald Trump holding a Bible in front of a church. He made it to Michigan and turned back.
A state-arranged second exam concluded that Zipoy "was far removed from the reality of his circumstances" when he shot Guion.
As for why Guion was targeted, the follow-up diagnosis found that Zipoy equated him to the serial killer Ted "Unabomber" Kaczynski and his duty was "to free the world."
Hocevar said "the victim's family is understandably not satisfied. ... You try to explain it the best you can. We don't convict the mentally ill."
Several family members were allowed to give victim impact statements during Wednesday's hearing, a gesture from the judge that is usually reserved for sentencing. They spoke of Guion being a single father working two jobs while raising his children after their mother left.
Candace Garlitos, Guion's granddaughter, told the court, "To have somebody killed right in front of me, somebody that I love so deeply, with that scene running through my head like a movie on a never-ending loop, is something that I am afraid will continue the rest of my life."

Full text: Howanda Williams was homeless, hungry and broke last fall when the 2ndChanceProject found her a room at a Brooklyn Center hotel, provided meals and then found her a permanent place to live.
"I am grateful," said Williams, a mother of three kids under 8. "They gave me the resources I needed. They saved my life."
But Williams fears others like her will be left on the street. A state contract awarded to the Minneapolis nonprofit to run the Hotel to Home program expires at the end of March. Without additional funding, the program, which has served more than 80 families since last fall, will be forced to shut down.
"I am worried," said C.J. Jessup, 2ndChanceProject founder. "I believe somebody somewhere can see the good in what we do."
Jessup founded the 2ndChanceProject last year just as unrest after the death of George Floyd bubbled up.
He wanted to help those being released from prison or state hospitals integrate back into society. Drawing on his work experience in group homes, Jessup secured a large house in south Minneapolis. In August he took in three men and provided them with shelter and a place to develop leadership skills.
Jessup learned about Hennepin County's Hotel to Home program, and that led him to the Radisson Hotel in Brooklyn Center, where a different program had been housing people evicted from homeless encampments. There were problems with violence, crime and drugs, said Laural Kenney, the hotel's director of sales. Jessup took over and everything changed, she said.
Kenney said the Radisson is hoping to keep the partnership going.
"The perception is that people who live like this do it to see what they can get for free," Kenney said. "The truth is that something has happened for them to get to this. This is about doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. Everybody deserves a second chance."
The 2ndChanceProject is designed to provide family structure, self-discipline and personal development. The nonprofit provides people with rooms, three meals a day, clothing, medical services, counseling, security and "whatever they need," Jessup said, until they find long-term housing. The bills are paid with money from the federal CARES Act.
Jessup used $766,000 in CARES Act funding to cover expenses from October to December. He was granted another $578,000 to get through February, and stretched that through March by laying off some staff and using fewer rooms.
Now just 15 people, including eight children, remain at the Radisson. They will have to leave if funding runs out Wednesday.
Jessup, who has started a GoFundMe account, said he hopes some of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that President Biden signed into law will trickle down to his nonprofit. He said he also reached out to several cities in Hennepin County for help.
"We took their people," he said. "We saw the $27 million the Floyd family got. They found funding for that. I can prevent the next George Floyd. This is where the need is. This program works."
Williams agreed. She came to Minneapolis from Iowa with nothing to her name. She planned on living with a relative but that didn't work out.
Then she heard about the 2ndChanceProject and she, her fianc and children ages 8, 4 and 1 moved into the Radisson in November. In January, they moved into a three-bedroom apartment.
"They do such a good job," Williams said. "I hope they can do it for the next family."

British tabloid is denied media credentials in trial: Outlet published police video of George Floyd against court orders.

Full text: The Daily Mail has been denied media credentials to cover the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for publishing "stolen" police camera footage.
Staff working for the British tabloid are also denied access to trial exhibits, the media center and "any and all" media updates, according to the order filed on Wednesday. The court made the decision several months before the order was filed and made it official at the request of the Daily Mail to allow them to seek a legal review of the decision.
The Daily Mail can still obtain trial exhibits from other media.
"This Court assumes that the Daily Mail paid for the stolen video footage. The Court is therefore confident that the Daily Mail can pay to obtain the trial exhibits associated with this case," according to the order. "This is not a hardship for the Daily Mail, it is merely an inconvenience."
The Daily Mail published segments of two police body-worn camera videos showing the arrest and death of George Floyd, in August.
The footage was made available for "public" viewing inside the Hennepin County courthouse in mid-July, but it was prohibited from being recorded or publicly distributed.
The footage was apparently leaked to the publication, according to its article.
Because the publication disregarded the court order against publication of the footage, the court was "required to pursue an equitable consequence."

Jury is set, opening statements next: Spare member chosen to hedge bet for opening day of Derek Chauvin's trial.

Full text: The final juror was selected Tuesday in the trial of fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd.
Court is now in recess until 9 a.m. Monday, when opening statements will be made by both sides. The fourth jury candidate interviewed Tuesday was the 15th and final juror chosen. But the juror, a recently married white male accountant in his 20s, will be dropped from the panel if the first 14 show up for duty at the heavily guarded downtown Minneapolis courthouse.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding, said he will keep 14 jurors, including two alternates, for the trial expected to last a month. Spacing requirements in the courtroom because of the COVID-19 pandemic don't allow for additional alternates.
At the conclusion of the trial, the two alternates will be dismissed and a dozen jurors will deliberate to see whether they can reach unanimous agreement on the three criminal counts Chauvin faces.
The longtime officer, who was captured on bystander video kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, is charged with second- and third-degree murder as well as manslaughter. Three other fired Minneapolis police officers, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, are expected to stand trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Throughout selection, Chauvin sat quietly next to his lawyer Eric Nelson. He wore a suit and tie every day, usually blue or pale gray, and made notes on a large yellow legal pad. He wore a mask much of the time and rarely showed emotion beyond an occasional tight smile when he removed the mask as he was introduced to prospective jurors.
Sometimes, Chauvin would confer with Nelson and defense assistant Amy Voss, but his voice was not heard in the room or on the livestream.
Among the 15 selected to judge him are six people of color and nine white people. Nine jurors are women, and six are men. Chauvin is white. Floyd was Black.
The jurors are: a multirace woman in her 20s, a multirace woman in her 40s, two Black men in their 30s, a Black man in his 40s, a Black woman in her 60s, four white women in their 50s, a white woman in her 40s, a white man in his 30s, two white men in their 20s, and a white woman in her 20s.
Jury selection lasted more than two weeks and was nearly derailed by the announcement by the city of Minneapolis on March 12 of a record $27 million lawsuit settlement with Floyd's family. Cahill recalled seven jurors who were seated before the announcement and then dismissed two of them from duty after they said the payout amount swayed them.
A week ago, city leaders discussed the settlement at yet another news conference. An overwhelming majority of the prospective jurors who arrived for questioning after the announcement were aware of it.
The juror seated Tuesday said he heard about the settlement but that it wouldn't affect his ability to serve in the criminal trial. The man, who is moving out of Minnesota in late May, said he thinks analytically thanks to his profession and could weigh the evidence fairly.
He said he has a neutral opinion of Floyd and a generally favorable view of the Black Lives Matter movement, but he believes its activists were "a contributing factor" in the violent unrest that followed Floyd's death.
Concerning the mission behind the alternative Blue Lives Matter rallying cry on behalf of police, he wrote months ago in his juror questionnaire that it "has not done enough to enhance the conversation about other issues such as gun control." He said that while he understands why athletes kneel during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in America, he wishes they would do so in a different manner.
The identities of the prospective jurors were not revealed during selection and will remain guarded for the duration of the trial. Although the selection process was livestreamed and available globally, no jury candidates' images were shown and the court often warned them against sharing information so personal that it could reveal their identity.
Throughout the process when a juror needed to provide sensitive details, Cahill silenced the public audio feed so the discussion wouldn't be broadcast.
The jurors were told that Cahill will eventually reveal their names when he deems it "safe" to do so. The seated jurors were all asked -- during questioning in court and on the 14-page written questionnaires they filled out beforehand -- about their personal safety concerns.
Generally, those who expressed deep fears or concerns were dismissed.
Among those watching the selections was Ben Crump, the attorney who helped the Floyd family win the $27 million settlement and who stood with Mayor Jacob Frey on stage for the announcement.
"This is not a hard case," Crump said in a news release after selections were finished. "George Floyd had more witnesses to his death than any other person ever -- white or Black. We all saw the same thing -- the indisputable and unjustified torture and murder by a police officer of a Black man who was handcuffed, restrained and posed no harm."

In choosing jury, race, bias hard to separate

Author: Norfleet, Nicole

Full text: The jury selection process in former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial is putting new focus on how race and bias are handled in the state's justice system.
The issue arose most prominently last week with the dismissal of potential juror No. 76, a Black man who was dismissed by Chauvin's defense attorneys after he shared his opinion that Black people such as himself don't receive equal treatment by Minneapolis police and in the justice system overall.
"As a Black man, you see a lot of Black people get killed and no one's held accountable for it and you wonder why or what was the decisions, and so with this, maybe I'll be in the room to know why," he told the court.
The man, whose identity was not disclosed, talked about how he used to live near the area where Chauvin had been filmed kneeling on the neck of George Floyd and that the community felt antagonized by Minneapolis police. After somebody was shot or went to jail nearby, he said, police were known to drive through the neighborhood blasting the song "Another One Bites the Dust."
While the Army veteran wasn't shy to share that racism affected him every day, he attested he could put his opinions aside to judge the case on the facts presented.
Still, the potential juror was dismissed with defense attorney Eric Nelson reasoning that the man was biased against the Minneapolis Police Department.
For some closely watching the case, the juror's dismissal showed how hard it can be for those with negative experiences of policing, especially people of color, to be allowed to provide critical voices in cases where policing is being questioned.
During jury selection, potential jurors are questioned individually. Judge Peter Cahill is allowed to dismiss prospective jurors. The attorneys can also motion for the judge to dismiss jurors "for cause" if they are perceived to show bias, as well as use "peremptory" strikes without providing a specific reason, though the lawyers can't dismiss jurors due to race. Like any attorney, Nelson is compelled to work in the best interest of his client by trying to make sure that jurors can be open-minded about Chauvin's case.
Nelson used a peremptory strike against the juror after the judge declined to remove him for cause. Cahill noted that the man said that despite his experience he was able to be fair.
Among the 14 jurors seated so far, six are people of color, with four identifying as Black and two identifying as multiracial, with a diverse array of viewpoints. One Black man in his 30s who immigrated to the United States more than a decade ago told the court he recalled saying to himself after George Floyd died: "It could have been anybody, it could have been you." Another Black man said he believed that discrimination is real and that he didn't feel Chauvin "had any intention of harming anybody, but somebody did die."
A 15th juror, who has yet to be confirmed, will be excused next week unless needed.
"For me, the pivotal question was whether the judge would allow Number 76 to be excused from the Chauvin jury because of his lived experience as a Black man," former Hennepin County chief public defender Mary Moriarty wrote in a column for the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, the oldest Black-owned newspaper in Minnesota. "For a moment, I had hope. Unfortunately, the answer was yes."
While the law is not supposed to allow a prospective juror to be removed because of his or her race, Moriarty argued the "lived experiences" that juror No. 76 described weren't race-neutral, meaning they had to do with his experiences as a Black man.
Toussaint Morrison, a community organizer and director who left his job last year at Twin Cities Public Television in the wake of Floyd's death, said the potential juror's experiences weren't that different from what other Black men may experience on a regular basis.
"His experiences are valid and you can't take that away from him," Morrison said. "Would that be the experience of other Black men that might have gone to that court? Yeah. … Is it my experience? Absolutely. Have I been pulled over jogging? Yes. Have I been pulled over on a bike that was mine and that I owned? Yes."
Race matters, and it can't be erased from the courtroom, said Morrison, who recently spoke about jury selection at a rally outside the Hennepin County Courthouse.
Juror No. 76's dismissal hasn't been the only part of jury selection that has offended some activists. Protesters took issue with the dismissal of another potential juror, a woman originally from Mexico who Judge Cahill said might have lacked some sophistication to understand certain legal terms.
University of Minnesota law professor Jon Lee said that in cases such as the Chauvin trial there is a very thin line between what could be perceived as a race-motivated strike against a juror and what isn't.
"It is nearly impossible to try to disentangle race and one's experiences as a person of color with this case," said Lee, whose expertise includes judicial behavior and legal ethics. "That said … we need to impanel a jury that would be able to bring their experiences to bear in hearing this case."
Lee said it is extremely difficult to prove that an opposing attorney has struck a juror on the basis of race using what is called a Batson challenge, named after a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court case Batson v. Kentucky during which the court ruled that peremptory strikes cannot be used to dismiss jurors because of their race. After a judge has been convinced that a strike could have been used because of a juror's race, the attorney who issued the strike has to present a "race-neutral" reason for dismissing the juror.
"The defense attorney is going to argue that it is not on an account of race but rather because of his prior experiences with the police department and what he has observed," Lee said. "But that is necessarily tied up in the fact that he is a Black man."
Washington and California have rules making it easier to mount a challenge to prevent race-based dismissals, Lee said. It takes large, publicized cases like the Chauvin trial to put more pressure on lawmakers and courts to improve the processes, Lee said.
Though the public might think attorneys are trying to find impartial jurors, the truth of the matter is that it is an adversarial process and they want to find jurors who will be more sympathetic to their side of the case, said Samuel Sommers, a psychology professor and director of the Racial Equity & Diversity Lab at Tufts University in Massachusetts. It is impossible for people to not have some biases, he added.
At first look, the jury selected for the Chauvin trial appears to be racially diverse, but that doesn't mean that everything has been perfect, he said.
In his research, Sommers has found that more diverse juries tend to be more thorough and weigh different types of evidence more carefully than in more racially homogenous juries. A diverse jury is also important for the judicial system to be perceived to be legitimate to the general public, he said.
"The beauty of the jury system is every single person on that jury has a say here. They have to be unanimous," Sommers said. "That's not always the case in life when you are of a minority perspective or group that you have that kind of power."

Full text: Jury selection could conclude Tuesday with the selection of a 15th juror for the Hennepin County District Court trial of Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd.
One juror, the 14th selected in a process that began March 8, was seated Monday. Judge Peter Cahill wants 15 jurors vetted and on the panel to report for duty next week. But the 15th is a spare who will be dismissed before trial if not needed.
For the trial, expected to last a month beginning with opening statements next Monday, Cahill will keep 14 jurors, including two alternates. At the end of the trial, any remaining alternates will be dismissed before deliberations. Only a dozen jurors will deliberate whether to convict or acquit the former Minneapolis police officer of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and/or manslaughter in Floyd's death May 25.
If a 15th juror is seated, court is expected to recess for the remainder of the week, giving everyone a break from two-plus weeks of the grinding and repetitive but high-stakes process of jury selection.
More than 70 potential jurors have been called into the courtroom for questioning.
At the end of the day Monday, Cahill said it was "12 or bust" on Tuesday, referring to the number of jury candidates who were told to arrive at the courthouse for questioning.
"We're going to call in 12, and we're going to go through all 12," if necessary, the judge said. Lawyers were told to be prepared to work a longer day to seat the final juror.
The newest juror selected Monday was a white woman in her 20s. She is a newlywed and a social worker in Wright County whose clients are coping with mental health difficulties. She owns a Goldendoodle puppy.
She said her profession had trained to her to be empathetic. "I'm always thinking about the person and where he came from," she said of her views on Chauvin and his actions the day Floyd died. "Was it his training?"
Regarding Floyd, she said, "I'm always looking at why someone has done something a certain way. … I had all kinds of thoughts of him … his past with drugs and things like that. I had every emotion."
When the woman talked about hearing both sides at trial, defense lawyer Eric Nelson reminded her that Chauvin doesn't have to present evidence and the state has the burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The juror responded, "Mr. Chauvin's side is his presumption of innocence. That is what I meant by that."
In all, eight jurors stepped in for questioning Monday. The defense used two discretionary strikes on candidates, and the state used one.
Cahill dismissed four himself.
Selection was to resume Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Monday's afternoon session began with a now-familiar problem when the first prospective juror said he couldn't be impartial given the announcement of the record $27 million payout by the city of Minneapolis to Floyd's family. It "swayed my opinion that they got that much money," the man said.
Minneapolis disclosed the settlement March 12, when the court had already seated seven jurors. Cahill recalled those jurors for questioning and then dismissed two who said they were biased by the amount of the settlement.
The judge previously called the city's settlement timing "unfortunate." His frustration leaked through again Monday, when he deadpanned after dismissing the prospective juror that "I guess we can't disagree with the premise anymore."
Cahill didn't elaborate, but his words echoed those of City Attorney Jim Rowader, who publicly pushed back at a news conference Thursday, when asked whether the timing of the civil settlement had affected jury selection in Chauvin's criminal case.
In response to that question, Rowader said, "I disagree with the underlying premise."
Through Monday, six people of color and eight white jurors are among the 14 chosen. Nine are women and five are men.
Those chosen are: a multirace woman in her 20s, a multirace woman in her 40s, two Black men in their 30s, a Black man in his 40s, a Black woman in her 60s, four white women in their 50s, a white woman in her 40s, a white man in his 30s, a white man in his 20s, and a white woman in her 20s. Jurors will be sequestered during deliberations.
The other defendants in the case -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.

Churches search souls over names

Author: Hopfensperger, Jean

Full text: Colonial Church of Edina, whose name and architecture reflect its roots in 17th-century New England, has long celebrated its religious ties to the early Pilgrim settlers. Church founders never imagined that the term "Colonial" might one day be associated with white oppression, or that some members might want to throw out the church's name for that reason.
But that's just what has happened. The well-known west-metro congregation is reeling from an emotional debate over whether "Colonial Church" carries too much negative baggage amid today's heightened racial sensitivities.
The issue came to a head in January, when church members narrowly vetoed a proposal to change the 75-year-old name to an undetermined alternative.
The controversy at Colonial reflects the broader challenges facing religious congregations
across Minnesota as they strive to deal with racial justice issues following the death of George Floyd. Faith leaders are grappling with how far to go, how fast to move and what steps to take as they try to balance tradition and change without alienating members.
"It's really a hard time to lead," said the Rev. Jeff Lindsay, Colonial's senior pastor. "The culture around us is changing rapidly, and [clergy] have to meet that on both sides. There's a cost, one way or another."
Two of Colonial's sister churches from the Congregational tradition also are confronting the fragile balance between past and future. Just over a year ago, a majority at Plymouth Congregational Church in Minneapolis voted to remove a large wall tapestry, "Churchmen in the New World," from the social hall because its depiction of Native people was considered racially offensive.
And Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis has announced it will decide whether to change its name -- associated with the arrival of the Pilgrims -- before the congregation's centennial in 2025.
The Mayflower name "is constantly bubbling up, from parents who use our child care center to people we meet," said the Rev. Sarah Campbell, senior pastor at Mayflower. "For example, some of us were at a Line 3 [Enbridge pipeline] encampment last year, and when we introduced ourselves someone asked, 'What do you make of that name?' "
Jim Bear Jacobs, director of racial justice and community engagement for the Minnesota Council of Churches, said such challenges are not uncommon as faith leaders test new ideas -- sometimes quickly.
"In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, there's been a lot of churches with racial justice teams or advocacy groups, and there's been an urgency for things to be done within those groups," he said. "I've seen increased requests for special speakers, for trainings, for guidance on resources to do more heavy lifting on issues of racial justice, historic injustice, what reparation could look like."
'Change is hard'
Colonial Church is rooted in the Congregational tradition, which traces its history to Puritan church reformers who fled persecution in England and settled in New England. Congregationalists have a history of embracing progressive causes, from the abolitionist movement in the 1800s to the racial and social justice movement today.
Colonial's sprawling church complex is modeled after a New England village. Its rooms carry names of colonial leaders such as the Anne Bradstreet Hearth Room and the Gov. John Carver Common, which holds a replica of the Mayflower ship and a copy of the Declaration of Independence.
The idea for a name change originated with church members and the church council in July, and it was unanimously embraced by staffers and clergy. They held virtual town hall meetings and "listening sessions," and created a web page for members to directly express opinions.
Supporters argued that the word "colonial" often carries a negative association for people who aren't white Americans, and that the arrival of English colonizers marked the destruction of a way of life for Indigenous people and the enslavement of Black people. They said it was offensive to some church members as well as community and global partners.
"The name says something about us that isn't true," said the Rev. Sara Wilhelm Garbers, of Colonial's ministerial team. "This is a church that has long cared about the world, long cared about justice. That's why we felt it was imperative to consider changing it."
Opponents of the proposal questioned its rationale and timing, especially amid a pandemic. Who and where were all these people offended by the church's name?
"I too saw 'colonial' as being more about our Pilgrim past, our New England founders, etc.," wrote member Pam Palmer on the name change web page in November. "Now everything about our nation's past is deemed horrible and our history is being erased and obscured. … Will we now also redesign the church itself so it doesn't offend anyone?"
The proposal to change the name was approved by a majority of members, or 61.5%, but the number fell short of the 67% supermajority needed to pass. The issue is on hold, but congregation tensions remain.
"We learned that change is hard," said Lindsay. "It will be too fast for some, to slow for others. Too far for some, not far enough for others. The hard work is finding common ground moving forward."
Historical baggage
A name change is one of the more dramatic steps that Minnesota churches are considering in relation to racial issues. Numerous others are bringing in speakers, offering workshops on white privilege, hosting book clubs on bestsellers such as Ibram X. Kendi's "How to Be an Antiracist," and providing financial support to communities in need. Colonial, for example, has a $1 million "Blessing initiative" that funds nonprofits and new businesses tackling critical community needs.
Churches are also re-examining their own denominations.
"Every denomination has a mixed bag in terms of its history," said the Rev. Anita Bradshaw, an adjunct professor at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and author of "Change and Conflict in Your Congregation."
Congregationalists "had boarding schools," she said. "We colluded with business in Hawaii to overthrow the queen."
Southern Baptists used Christianity to justify slavery, and the Catholic Church forced religious conversion, often with violence, on Indigenous people across the Americas. Many Christian denominations, including Lutherans and Methodists, ran boarding schools for Native American children that forced them to abandon their language and culture.
"It was a different time and a different view of the world," said Bradshaw. "Churches can't undo history, but they can make efforts going forward to not just apologize but do something differently."
Nationally, the pilgrim symbol also has faced scrutiny, including the name of the Pilgrim Press, the oldest continuously operating publishing house in North America. The denomination that now represents Congregationalists -- the United Church of Christ (UCC), following a 1950s merger -- grappled with changing the publisher's name as well, said the Rev. John Dorhauer, UCC president.
After consulting Indigenous leaders and others, Dorhauer said a compromise was reached that allowed it "to perpetuate this historic name in a way that isn't offensive." The name now reads "the pilgrim press" in lowercase, so it doesn't refer to white colonizers "but generically to all who wander and explore."
While pilgrims and colonizers are not flash points for most Christian churches, others still grapple with how to tackle an often unconscious bias in names, programming, staffing and community involvement.
"These are unprecedented times," said Lindsay. "We're dealing with things we haven't dealt with before."

RACIAL JUSTICE TESTS FAMILY TIES: POLICE OFFICER, EX-JUDGE WORK TO SEE EYE TO EYE.

Full text: Jai Hanson sat in his Bloomington squad car and focused on the police radio. A police precinct was burning. Rioters were looting. Looking north from his quiet suburb, he saw black clouds pluming from the city where he'd grown up.
Hanson felt his profession was under assault. He worried about police officer friends in Minneapolis, tasked with restoring peace in the days after George Floyd died under the knee of one of their own. Hanson was disgusted by the video of officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, and he was disgusted at the destruction.
One moment that night felt most surreal. Between chaotic reports on the police radio, Hanson heard the emotion-tinged voice of a supervisor. "We took an oath to serve," the supervisor said. "Just remember there are more people who support you than who don't."
The next day, Hanson and some police friends laid flowers at Floyd's memorial. He wrote an emotional post on Facebook about officers dedicated to fighting injustice. "To the people that spent a few days protesting and judging me for not being there: Spare me your lecture," he wrote.
Later, he drove to his parents' house, and in their front window he saw a big sign. "SAY THEIR NAMES," it read, listing people killed by police. Anti-police sentiment was everywhere. Now it felt like it was in his childhood home.
And Jai Hanson was furious.
The fault line that cracked open last summer between Jai Hanson and his father, retired Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Sam Hanson, is not a unique story in this divisive era. Disagreements lead to fractures -- in politics, certainly, but in more intimate spaces as well: between neighbors, among friends, inside families. In the face of discord, people shut one another out. They unfriend. Mute. Ignore. Cancel.
This father and son had a disagreement. A big one. But they also had love and respect and an ethic of service -- and a lifelong bond between a child from an orphanage in India and a big family in Minnesota. So amid their fracture, they decided to find common ground.
Worry, and pride
Life was going well for Sam and Mirja Hanson. By the mid-1980s, they had four kids and successful careers: Mirja as a consultant and adjunct professor, Sam as an attorney who would eventually become a judge. They prided themselves on being worldly and making that world a better place. Sam had cofounded a nonprofit, Global Volunteers. The Hansons wanted to adopt a child from India -- both to help a child and to expand their family's horizons.
The adoption hit bureaucratic delays and looked like it wouldn't happen, so the Hansons adopted a boy from Texas in 1984. But a few years later came a call from an Indian orphanage: "We have a boy for you." The Hansons decided to adopt Jai, too.
Jai was always introspective and diplomatic. He was a peer mediator at Hale Elementary School in south Minneapolis, and he loved asking his dad about intricacies of first-degree murder cases appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court.
When he decided to become a police officer, his parents were surprised. They were scared as well, especially when he'd tell stories about disarming volatile people, or about being first on a murder scene. They worried that constantly dealing with people at their lowest moments could give Jai a jaundiced view of the world.
But they were also proud. Jai had gone into law enforcement for idealistic reasons. He can be firm or gentle. He speaks empathetically of those wronged by police.
A symbolic moment came when fellow Bloomington officers viewed the video of a South Carolina police officer shooting Walter Scott in the back in 2015.
"We were all silent," Jai recalled. "Then someone said, 'That officer just made our job a lot harder today.' There's that saying: Nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop."
But when Jai saw the sign in his parents' window -- "SAY THEIR NAMES" -- his reflexive reaction was a defensive sort of anger. The sign felt flippant and anti-law enforcement. He drove off in a huff. Later, he wrote his dad an e-mail that the sign deeply offended him. In 14 years in law enforcement, he'd never heard his parents express sadness about a police officer getting killed.
A second sign in the window
"I didn't quite anticipate how much that sign would emotionally impact him," Sam Hanson said later. "I probably should have."
After reading his son's e-mail, Sam Hanson took a breath and wrote him back.
He wrote that he's obviously saddened when a police officer dies. Sam wrote that he and Mirja had visited the police officer memorial at the State Capitol and read names of slain Minnesota police. He told his son that after these emotional moments passed, Jai would realize his parents do support police -- that senseless deaths of police officers, as well as of citizens at the hands of police, are both tragic.
In the window, Sam put a second sign.
"HONOR THEIR SACRIFICE," it read, and listed names of police officers killed in the line of duty.
Jai Hanson believes law enforcement is an honorable profession. He loves being an officer; in fact, he's considering running for Hennepin County sheriff. He believes policing has problems, and in order to reform, its leaders must acknowledge a past that's been oppressive to people of color. But like most police officers, his instinct is to defend his own.
His dad understands that now.
"It's almost an unconscious reaction to find a defense for the officer involved, knowing that but for the grace of God go I," Sam Hanson said of his son. "When events like that happen, cops identify with the officer involved: 'How did he get to that point?' 'Was this a dangerous situation?' I on other hand tend to identify with the victim: 'How did he get in the situation?' 'Why couldn't police have handled this in a different way?' "
Yet the morning after Floyd's death, Jai Hanson took to Facebook and did something rare: He publicly criticized another police officer. "My heart hurts for George Floyd and his family," he wrote. "The officers involved have just made it a lot harder for every other officer that [does] their job with integrity, compassion and respect for all they encounter regardless of the circumstances."
Tense months
There was an unspoken tension between father and son in the months after. But they focused on other things -- talking about family, going golfing, complaining about Minnesota sports teams -- that would ease them into more substantive conversations about policing. Sam came to understand Jai's gut defensiveness; Jai tried to tone that defensiveness down and think deeper when his father spoke of systemic racism.
They came to realize their differences are ultimately on the margins -- on their degree of empathy for victims vs. their degree of empathy for police -- and that they agree far more than they disagree.
They know that these overheated political discussions don't need to be either/or, but instead can be both: Father and son are both anti-racism and pro-police. They agree policing needs big reforms but that "defunding" police is, as Sam Hanson put it, "immature and oversimplified." They realize you can have empathy for police officers and the no-win situations they frequently face, as well as empathy for victims of police violence.
What Jai sees as a big problem with policing is exemplified by the family's sign incident. Ultimately, they look at that incident as a failure to empathize, a failure to communicate. Policing, too, has a communication problem. Police, Jai believes, do a bad job of getting out their good stories, and a bad job of communicating when a tragedy happens.
It all starts with trust, he said. Communities of color have lost trust in law enforcement and perception becomes reality.
"The history of the whole system and how it's really hurt people of color -- we need to acknowledge that," Jai Hanson said. "We're in a position where we can change things, and we're not changing."
"Beware of absolutes," Sam Hanson said. "Try to understand what the perspective is of people you disagree with, and why you came to that disagreement. If they understand where you're coming from, and you understand where they're coming from, you can build a bridge."

STAUBER'S PLAN TO FIX POLICING: THE FORMER POLICE OFFICER IS SEEKING LESS SWEEPING CHANGES THAN DOES THE BILL NAMED FOR GEORGE FLOYD.

Author: Woodall, Hunter

Full text: WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber has placed himself at the center of the national debate over police reform as the Republican and former Duluth police officer pushes an alternative to Democratic reforms proposed after the death of George Floyd last year.
"This is an opportunity for our nation," said Stauber, as he urges police reform less sweeping than what Democrats have proposed with a bill named for George Floyd. Stauber and fellow Minnesota Republicans voted against that measure this month as it passed the House, but it's not clear Democrats have the votes to get it through the Senate.
That's left a small opening for Stauber to advocate for an alternative he's sponsored in the House dubbed the JUSTICE Act. Stauber is adamant that his effort with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, is a better route to take on the issue.
"I'm trying to convince people to get back to the table," said Stauber, a 23-year law enforcement veteran who retired in 2017.
But the GOP's efforts to brandish law and order as one of the party's central themes have been complicated by the events of Jan. 6, when a violent group of protesters incited by then-President Donald Trump rioted at the U.S. Capitol.
A Capitol police officer died as a result of injuries that day. Some Republicans have downplayed the events of Jan. 6, and others have suggested without evidence that left-wing protesters were
actually responsible. FBI Director Christopher Wray has bluntly called the attack "domestic terrorism."
Stauber, who was once shot in the head while off duty, has a sign thanking Capitol Police posted on his office door in Washington. But he wouldn't go as far as Wray's labeling of the Capitol attack.
"I don't think it was domestic terrorism," Stauber said in an interview this week at his congressional office. He described it as "unlawful activity, criminal activity."
"Assaulting police officers, assaulting one another, damage to property, that's all unlawful behavior, and I condemn that," Stauber said. "And I want everyone to be held to ... the highest standard of the law."
The other Republican members of Minnesota's delegation did not respond to questions about whether they viewed Jan. 6 as domestic terrorism. Both Rep. Tom Emmer and Rep. Jim Hagedorn sent statements in support of Stauber's legislation.
Stauber said he looks forward to a 9/11-style commission on Jan. 6 but emphasized that "it has to be bipartisan because we want the truth." He consistently condemned "the Jan. 6 incident at the Capitol." Stauber also broadened his criticism to other examples of unrest and violence far from Capitol Hill, including in Minneapolis and Kenosha, Wis., saying he condemns "violence wholeheartedly."
The distance between Stauber's police reform bill and the Democrats' push is another example of the divide in Washington.
House Democrats' George Floyd Justice in Policing Act bars federal law enforcement from "no-knock warrants" in drug cases. Stauber's bill opts for data reporting on the use of those warrants. Democrats want to roll back "qualified immunity," which can protect officers from legal liability. Stauber and other Republicans say that could prevent people from becoming police officers. The Democrats' bill also seeks to prohibit religious and racial profiling by law enforcement.
The House Democrats' effort bans federal law enforcement from using chokeholds except in a limited deadly force capacity. The GOP bill has similar language. While both bills aim to tie federal money to state and local governments taking similar action, Democrats want the chokehold ban enacted into law, while Republicans call for a policy change.
"The George Floyd Act just has teeth that the JUSTICE Act doesn't," said Maria Ponomarenko, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota who is also co-founder and counsel of the Policing Project at the NYU School of Law.
Stauber, who represents the Eighth District spanning northeastern Minnesota, takes his law enforcement bona fides seriously, describing himself as having a "passion for the profession." One wall of Stauber's congressional office is adorned with three large frames showing an array of patches from law enforcement departments in his district. He's also stressed the importance of community policing and its focus in the GOP bill.
He believes if his bill made it to the House floor, it would pass and become law. That seems unlikely at this point. Senate Democrats largely helped doom the Republican bill's chances when it came to a vote last year. President Joe Biden has also made clear that he supports the Democrats' police reform bill and would sign it into law.
Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minneapolis civil rights attorney and activist, views the bill named after George Floyd as a start, but says it doesn't go far enough to overhaul the system. She said Stauber's bill is "not even within the realm of anything to get excited about."
"The JUSTICE Act as currently proposed by Rep. Stauber is a watered-down bill that does nothing to promote police accountability and if passed would result in increased funding and training opportunities for law enforcement," Levy Armstrong said. "But no real checks and balances to prevent police officers from being able to kill civilians."
Sen. Tina Smith also has concerns. The Minnesota Democrat says if Congress passed the GOP version, it would give Stauber and others "an opportunity to say that they'd done something."
"But I don't think it would really do anything," said Smith.
Yet like many other liberal priorities in Congress, the Democrats' bill faces the challenge of overcoming the Senate's 60-vote threshold. While some Senate Democrats have signaled they want to eliminate the filibuster, there's not enough support right now to make that a reality.
"I'm hoping that the Speaker will understand that the partisan bill has a slim to none chance … to passing the Senate," Stauber said.
The lead sponsor of the Democrats' bill, Rep. Karen Bass of California, conceded that it "would have a hard time getting sixty votes in the Senate." But so would the Republicans' option.
Bass said there are good parts in both bills, and stressed that while there are no negotiations, some have had "very informal conversations" on the matter, although she didn't disclose names. Bass said she enjoys working with Stauber and says his reluctance to call the Jan. 6 attack domestic terrorism doesn't impact their ability to work together on police reform.
"I keep my eyes on the prize," Bass said. "And the prize is a bill that improves policing in the United States on President Biden's desk."

Full text: Two jurors were dismissed Wednesday amid news of a record-setting settlement, and two more took their place on the panel that will decide whether a former Minneapolis police officer is guilty of murdering George Floyd last May.
"We're back where we started this morning," Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said at the end of the day.
That means nine jurors have been seated for the trial of ex-officer Derek Chauvin expected to start March 29. Five more jurors are needed, including two alternates, for the murder and manslaughter trial.
Jury selection began smoothly enough last week, but on Friday, Minneapolis leaders announced a $27 million settlement with Floyd's family. Because of the publicity surrounding that decision, Cahill brought back for virtual one-on-one questioning the seven jurors who were seated before what he called the "unfortunate broadcast" of the settlement.
Of those seven, Cahill dismissed two jurors, a white man in his 30s and a Hispanic man in his 20s.
The white man in his 30s said he was "swayed" by the "sticker shock" at the settlement amount. "That dollar amount was kind of shocking to me," he said.
The Hispanic man in his 30s said the settlement "kind of confirms opinions that I already have. … I think it will be hard to be impartial."
Cahill kept a female juror, a white nonprofit health care executive in her 50s, who said she had been thinking about the settlement. Cahill asked how she would respond to a fellow juror bringing up the payout during deliberations, and she replied, "I would say that has nothing to do with what we're discussing at this time. … It's not part of the case."
At the end of the day, Cahill announced that he had doled out additional discretionary strikes to the defense and the prosecution. He gave the defense three more and the state one. The defense has used 12 of 18 and the state used five of 10. Jury selection resumes Thursday morning.
The court planned three weeks to select a jury of 12 and two alternates for the livestreamed trial that is expected to last at least a month. The process was painstaking enough but became even more so after city leaders announced their settlement announcement last week to the chagrin of those in the courtroom for the criminal trial.
Cahill said he would rule Friday on defense attorney Eric Nelson's request to delay the start or move proceedings to another city because of the pervasive publicity about the settlement. The state opposes both.
Cahill has pressed prospective jurors about their knowledge of the settlement, with mixed responses, but by the end of the day Wednesday two new jurors had been seated.
The new male juror seated is a married Black father who lives in the suburbs and disagrees with the concept of "defunding" law enforcement. He said, "The police do a lot. … I would trust the police."
The second juror seated is a married white woman in her 40s who has a son. She is an organizational consultant who helps corporations improve personnel practices and efficiency. She said she spends a lot of time at ice hockey arenas.
Asked about the civil settlement, the woman said it wouldn't impact her. "I don't think that declares guilt one way or the other," she said. "I think people settle suits for many other reasons."
The jury includes four people of color and five people who are white. Five are men; four are women. Two are in their 20s, and three are in their 30s. Two each are in their 40s and 50s.
Despite the high-profile trial occurring in a heavily fortified courthouse that is essentially closed to all other business, the judge has been mostly calm and conversational on and off the bench. But that was not the case Wednesday when he issued a blistering warning to the media.
Cahill warned journalists who rotate daily in pairs into the 18th-floor courtroom against reporting what they see on Post-its, notepads and computer screens on the desks of the lawyers and their assistants. He also threatened the media with banishment from the courtroom if they repeat details about security measures in the building.
The judge, who months ago approved the unprecedented livestreaming of the proceedings, called such reporting "extremely irresponsible."
Cahill then proceeded with jury selection.
In addition to ruling on the defense motions about the trial's start date and location, the judge also is expected to rule soon on which details, if any, he will allow from Floyd's May 2019 encounter with Minneapolis police, a year before the incident in which he died.
In both incidents, Floyd swallowed drugs. In the earlier one, captured on police body camera video, the drugs led to a "hypertensive emergency" and the then-45-year-old Floyd's hospitalization.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Three other fired officers who assisted in Floyd's 2020 arrest -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.

Police: Floyd site must be made safe: FBI will help monitor troubled Chicago at 38th

Full text: The Minneapolis police chief vowed Wednesday to restore safety in and around the closed-off intersection where protesters gather to memorialize George Floyd's death.
Police Chief Medaria Arradondo gave no timeline for the changes, though he said federal agents will help fight crime and monitor the area at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, which has fallen under increased gun violence.
The intersection, now known as George Floyd Square, became a spot for mourning and reflection after Floyd died while being restrained by Minneapolis police last summer. City-erected concrete barricades that have kept the intersection closed to traffic are now being guarded by civilian occupiers often unwelcoming to law enforcement.
But violence disturbing the once-peaceful memorial has frustrated residents and business owners inside the square and surrounding it.
Arradondo said at a news conference that law enforcement will put an end to the criminal activity there.
"We cannot allow groups of individuals to feel that they're emboldened," Arradondo said. "They have to be held accountable. Period. … Yes, I'm putting them on notice. Enough's enough."
The announcement was met with mistrust from some at the square who had recently put out a plea for help, saying they are hesitant to believe change will come.
Arradondo said the best remedy is to reopen the intersection, but he did not specify when that would happen.
Though officials have been signaling their desire to reopen for months, they said recently
that they would not reopen the area until after the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who is facing murder charges in Floyd's death.
The police chief indicated Wednesday that a reopening could come sooner.
"We will dictate that timing and not let the trial dictate that," he said.
Mayor Jacob Frey said in an interview that he is aligned with the chief about the need to evaluate the timeline for reopening the intersection. Before that can happen, Frey said, they must ensure safety for public works staff coming in to remove the barricades as well as figure out a way to memorialize Floyd in an ongoing fashion.
"We want to see some additional infrastructure added that would provide a bump-out at the location where George Floyd was killed, to prevent tires from ever rolling over that sacred ground again," Frey said.
Arradondo said law enforcement, including the FBI, will restore peace to the area using all legal resources and tools. There will be an increased police presence near the intersection, he said.
"As chief I refuse to abdicate one block, one city block, to a group of individuals who choose violence over peace," Arradondo said.
Federal law enforcement agencies including the FBI Minneapolis Field Office, the U.S. Attorney's Office District of Minnesota, and the ATF St. Paul Field Division pledged their support and resources, standing with the chief Wednesday afternoon.
Acting U.S. Attorney W. Anders Folk said the focus will be on bringing federal charges against those carrying or using firearms during robberies and carjackings, or while dealing drugs.
Folk said the community is gripped by fear.
"These are residents, these are business owners and these are faith leaders who are simply trying to make a living, to raise their families, to build up their community and to uphold this space that to so many has become a sacred memorial," Folk said. "They must be able to do this in peace."
Arradondo cited statistics to illustrate the area's increase in crime: In 2019, there were three victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds in the area of 38th and Chicago, he said. In 2020, that number rose to 18. And ShotSpotter detections also increased dramatically, from 33 rounds detected in 2019 to 700 last year.
Frey said the city has a fundamental responsibility and duty to provide safety and security for residents. The law enforcement initiative is just one component of a plan for the area that also includes community outreach, job training and violence interruption services.
Tasha Clemons, owner of Clemons Conscious Salon, which sits inside the barriers, said she is fine with the square staying as it is.
"For us it is just about justice and what the square wants. My clients will find their way in here," Clemons said, adding that it is nice to have people out in the square. "It almost feels like the square is a community."
Dwight Alexander, who owns the restaurant Smoke in the Pit, said the city has said time and time again that it was opening the intersection.
"They made a big, big mistake -- the city, shutting it down," Alexander said. "I just can't get it out of my head, throwing the businesses to the wolves. They didn't come down and see what type of support we needed. With people harassing our delivery drivers and turning our people away from the gate, you know, making us suffer. … I'm going to be here, but it is a struggle right now."

Settlement unsettles Chauvin trial: Judge considers delay, plans to recall jurors.

Full text: The record-setting $27 million civil settlement between Minneapolis and the family of George Floyd weighed heavily Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court, bogging down attempts to seat jurors to hear the murder and manslaughter case against former police officer Derek Chauvin.
None of the seven potential jurors questioned Tuesday were seated. Judge Peter Cahill struck five of the candidates for bias or because they said serving would create a hardship, and defense attorney Eric Nelson used his strikes on the other two. Nelson has used 11 of his 15 strikes. Nine jurors have been seated with 14 needed for trial, including two alternates. Prosecutors have five strikes remaining.
Cahill again dealt with the pretrial fallout from the settlement. The judge said he would recall the seven jurors seated before Friday's announcement to question them Wednesday about their knowledge of last week's settlement. He is also expected to rule on defense requests to either move the trial or delay opening statements scheduled for March 29. The prosecution opposes both.
Cahill and Nelson expressed exasperation over city leaders' decision to announce the settlement just blocks from the courthouse where they are trying to seat the jury.
Nelson said his client's right to a fair trial is at risk. "You have elected officials -- the governor, the mayor -- making incredibly prejudicial statements about my client," he said.
Cahill denied Nelson's request for more defense strikes of prospective jurors but was particularly irked by an unnamed city official's assertion to the Washington Post that Hennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette said the announcement of the settlement could proceed.
In court, Cahill called that "not an accurate statement" and noted the settlement came out of a federal claim and didn't involve state courts.
"As I recall in my discussions with Judge Barnette, the answer was 'We can't tell you what to do,' " Cahill said, adding that the state courts have no jurisdiction over federal litigation or settlements.
He pointedly added, "I think the city is trying to dump their responsibility back on the court, where it does not belong."
Barnette declined to comment.
Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is overseeing the prosecution, declined to comment when asked by a reporter whether he or the court knew that a settlement had been reached before it was announced Friday. His son Jeremiah Ellison is a Minneapolis City Council member and voted for the settlement.
While Cahill was concerned about the settlement, he also called a leak in recent weeks about Chauvin agreeing to a plea deal to third-degree murder days after Floyd's death "particularly pernicious." Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr reportedly canceled that deal, according to the New York Times, which cited unnamed law enforcement officials.
In contrast, Cahill said the financial settlement "is not just a legal decision, it's a political one. … And I think the people in [this] room realize that."
In addition to Nelson's request to delay or move the trial, he also asked Cahill to reconsider allowing details from Floyd's May 2019 arrest in Minneapolis. Cahill previously denied testimony about the arrest, but opened the door Tuesday after hearing Nelson's arguments. He said he would rule Thursday.
In both May 2019 and 2020, Floyd swallowed drugs during his police encounters. In the earlier incident, captured on police body camera video, the drugs led to a "hypertensive emergency" and Floyd's hospitalization.
According to the evidence from the earlier arrest, Nelson said, a paramedic warned Floyd that his blood pressure was extremely high, and if he didn't calm down, he was at risk of a heart attack or stroke.
The cause of Floyd's death will be a core issue at trial. Nelson will walk carefully, but he will attempt to show that Floyd's ingestion of copious pills upon arrest -- not Chauvin's knee on his neck -- could have caused his death.
Nelson said the two arrests and Floyd's behavior were "remarkably similar." In both apprehensions, drugs were discovered in Floyd's car along with chewed-up pills in the back of the squad that tested positive for methamphetamine and fentanyl, along with Floyd's DNA.
Cahill said the relevance arguably was what "Mr. Floyd's bodily response to ingestion of a large amount of drugs might be."
Nelson responded, "Precisely."
Prosecutor Matthew Frank argued against admission of the 2019 arrest, calling it the "desperation of the defense" and an attempt to disparage Floyd's struggles with opiate addiction.
Throughout the afternoon Tuesday, Nelson attempted to get jurors to reveal bias so he wouldn't have to use his dwindling strikes.
He was successful with one of the afternoon's jurors, who told him there was "no unseeing the viral bystander video footage of the incident" in which Chauvin put his knee on Floyd's neck.
After extensive questioning by Nelson, Cahill eventually dismissed the man.
The day's final jury candidate was questioned extensively by prosecutors about a close friendship with a police officer who works for a large Twin Cities agency that is not Minneapolis police.
Prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked the man about his ability to weigh testimony from law enforcement against that of a bystander.
"Naturally, I would believe the police officer more," said the man, who lives in a suburb and has three grown children, "because they have more experience and training with what's going on than someone who is walking down the street."
Cahill asked who was more likely to tell the truth. The man replied, "I guess more likely the police officer."
The judge then excused the prospective juror.
Three other officers assisting in Floyd's arrest -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.

For aspiring cops, anti-racism focus

Full text: Aspiring police officers attending public colleges in Minnesota may soon be required to take classes on anti-racism and complete internships in diverse communities if recommendations from a task force on law enforcement education reform are accepted.
The task force, which was formed by the Minnesota State colleges and universities system last summer in response to George Floyd's death, presented its recommendations to the system's board of trustees Tuesday. The Minnesota State college system trains approximately 80% of state police officers through 22 certified professional programs. Ex-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, attended a Minnesota State community college, as did the three other officers charged in Floyd's death.
"The death of George Floyd is an urgent reminder for the reform of law enforcement in Minnesota. In Minnesota State, we've taken these initial steps to claim a leadership role in reforming the education and training of peace officers in the state of Minnesota," said Satasha Green-Stephen, the system's associate vice chancellor of academic affairs and one of the task force's leaders.
Task force members recommended infusing cultural competency and anti-racist concepts into all law enforcement and criminal justice programs in addition to requiring specific courses and work experience in diverse communities. They suggested revising crisis-intervention and trauma-informed trainings to be more culturally responsive and assessing students' cultural competency and implicit biases upon entry to and exit from law enforcement programs.
Other recommendations include recruiting more diverse law enforcement students and faculty, establishing advisory committees for each system program and expanding opportunities for current police officers to learn about anti-racism and cultural competency.
"The resulting recommendations provide a robust framework which not only focuses on the needed educational outcomes for new students but also focuses on providing current peace officers opportunities for lifelong learning," Minnesota State Chancellor Devinder Malhotra said.
The board of trustees is expected to approve the task force's recommendations during its Wednesday meeting.
Some of the recommendations can be implemented immediately while others will take longer to apply, Green-Stephen said. Minnesota State leaders will work with the Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training to ensure the curriculum changes meet state standards.
Members of the board of trustees praised the task force's work as comprehensive and forward-thinking on Tuesday. The task force -- whose members included students, faculty, law enforcement and community members -- convened monthly from August through February.
"This work is brilliant," Trustee Cheryl Tefer said. "I am so proud, and I am so hopeful."
Priscilla Mayowa, a task force member and president of the statewide community college student association LeadMN, struck a more skeptical tone. "My biggest concern … is that these recommendations will result in no real change."
Mayowa asked trustees to hold the chancellor accountable for ensuring the recommendations are fully implemented. She also urged administrators to seek more input from community members who have been hurt by police brutality and reconsider how they promote law enforcement programs to prospective students.
"A promotional video with multiple gun shooting scenes is an example of what we don't want," she said.
Hennepin Technical College President Merrill Irving Jr. expressed similar feelings, telling trustees that changing the way aspiring cops are taught is not just an "overnight quest."
"People like to say that these are brave and courageous conversations. I like to think of them more as needed and necessary conversations," said Irving, who also sat on the task force.

Full text: The attorney for fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin asked a judge Monday to postpone and move his murder trial to another city, saying Friday's highly publicized $27 million settlement between the city of Minneapolis and George Floyd's family unfairly taints prospective jurors and violates his client's constitutional right to a fair trial.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill did not immediately rule on the motions, and said he would take them under advisement as the trial seemed primed to coast through jury selection and toward testimony after seven jurors were seated last week and an appellate court matter was settled.
Defense attorney Eric Nelson expressed concern Monday that jurors chosen last week and prospective jurors waiting to be questioned could be prejudiced by the unanimously approved settlement. The City Council signed off on the settlement as proceedings moved along Friday and announced it at a widely publicized and livestreamed news conference alongside Floyd's family members and legal team.
"I am gravely concerned with the news that broke on Friday related to the civil settlement in this case," Nelson said to the judge. "The fact that this came in the exact middle of jury selection is perplexing to me, your honor."
He said the settlement's timing was "very suspicious" and that council members used "very well-designed terminology" in their public remarks that could influence jurors.
Prosecutor Steve Schleicher argued for jury selection to continue uninterrupted.
"All I can say to the court is there are some things the state of Minnesota and this prosecution team can control, and there are some things it cannot control," he said. " … We cannot and do not control the Minneapolis City Council, and we certainly cannot and do not control the news cycle."
Schleicher opposed Nelson's motion to delay the trial despite the prosecution's three failed attempts to persuade Cahill and the Court of Appeals to postpone the trial until the summertime due to COVID-19 concerns.
Cahill agreed the settlement's timing was troubling. No city officials have addressed the issue publicly.
"You would agree it's unfortunate, wouldn't you," Cahill asked Schleicher, "that we have this reported all over the media when we're in the midst of jury selection?"
"I don't know which way it cuts," Schleicher said.
"The problem is that it cuts," Cahill said. "I think the defense has a legitimate concern, and even the state has a concern."
The judge continued: "I wish city officials would stop talking about this case so much. At the same time, I don't find any evil intent that they were trying to tamper with this case. … The timing is not related to this case."
Cahill intends to bring back the seven jurors chosen last week so they can be questioned about what they heard about the settlement and whether it would affect their ability to be impartial.
To underscore his point, Nelson noted that the City Council waited until after jurors convicted former Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor in 2019 of fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond before announcing a $20 million settlement with her family. He also remarked that Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is leading the prosecution, is the father of Minneapolis City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison.
"We've got a mayor [Jacob Frey] who's a lawyer by trade -- he should know better -- and obviously Mr. Ellison's son is a City Council member," Nelson said. "I'm not accusing Mr. Ellison of anything, but it is profoundly disturbing to the defense. The goal of this system is to provide a fair trial, and this is not fair."
Nelson asked the judge for extra peremptory strikes, which can be used to dismiss prospective jurors without explanation, and to immediately sequester jurors upon their selection. Cahill denied the extra strikes. Nelson has used nine of 15 peremptory strikes by the end of Monday. Prosecutors have used five of their nine strikes.
After a brief morning break, Attorney General Ellison returned to the courtroom and said something along the lines of, "Is there anything else someone would like to not accuse me of?" in reference to Nelson's comments.
Ellison's spokesman, John Stiles, said the attorney general had no comment about the statement. Jeremiah Ellison did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Nelson's concerns about news of the settlement tainting prospective jurors were realized when the day's first candidate, a woman, said she "gasped" when she heard of the $27 million payout and could not be impartial. She was promptly dismissed. However, the other seven people questioned Monday did not mention seeing news of the settlement.
Two jurors were chosen Monday, bringing the total to nine. The jury is nearly half people of color and half white, consisting of: a white man in his 20s, a multiracial woman in her 20s, two white men in their 30s, two Black men in their 30s, one Hispanic man in his 20s and two white women in their 50s.
The eighth juror seated is a Black man in his 30s who works in banking and coaches youth sports. He said he saw the bystander viral video of Floyd's May 25 arrest.
"I don't think [Chauvin] had any intention of harming anybody, but somebody did die," he said, adding somebody could have intervened and stopped him.
He pledged he could be objective. He also said he was once arrested for a driving offense and the police acted professionally, that he witnessed Minneapolis police use excessive force on a person downtown and that he knows a few officers at his gym who are "great guys."
Nelson asked whether he ended up voting not guilty, "Would you be able to tell the kids you coach and explain why you did?" The man said he could.
The ninth juror selected is a white woman in her 50s who lives outside Minneapolis, works as an executive assistant in a clinical health care setting and is a single mother.
She has viewed bystander video of Floyd's arrest, but wrote in her questionnaire, "I couldn't watch it in full because it was too disturbing to me."
However, she said, "I'm not in a position to change the law. I'm in a position to uphold the law. … He's innocent until we can prove otherwise."
She said she has a "somewhat negative" opinion of Black Lives Matter and a "negative" opinion of the protests that followed Floyd's death because the community took a "beating" from them. She reported having a "somewhat negative" opinion of Chauvin.
"I got the impression he didn't care about George Floyd," she said.
Many jury candidates Monday echoed those called in last week and recalled watching parts of the bystander video, consuming news at the time and seeing headlines about the upcoming trial. Prospective jurors received a lengthy questionnaire in the mail about three months ago and were asked to avoid news coverage in the interim.
A 75-year-old man was dismissed by the judge after telling the court, "I didn't even see the whole video. I saw as much as I could take of the video, and I was appalled by what I saw, and that feeling continues to be with me."
Another man said he is an educator who works with students of color.
"I'd be a horrible candidate as a juror," he said. "I couldn't go back and look at my students and my colleagues. … I am almost sick to my stomach right now."

Charges filed in fatal shooting at George Floyd Square: Slaying may have been gang-related, according to the complaint.

Full text: Prosecutors have lodged murder charges against a man thought to have fired the fatal shots in the death of another man at George Floyd Square in south Minneapolis earlier this month.
Shantaello Christianson faces charges of second-degree murder, first-degree riot and illegal possession of a firearm in the March 6 fatal shooting of 30-year-old Imez Wright outside of Cup Foods, 3759 S. Chicago Av. Wright, who worked for a community group that provided security in the area, died at a nearby hospital after being struck multiple times in the chest and hand, authorities said.
The charges come five days after Christianson and his wife were arrested on March 10 in Brooklyn Center, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in Hennepin County District Court.
Authorities announced the arrests at a news conference later that day, but initially refused to provide any further details, citing an "extremely active" investigation.
The complaint says that Wright was hanging outside Cup Foods when surveillance video captured Christianson pulling up in a sport utility vehicle. A man, later identified as a relative of Christianson's wife, is then seen on video getting out and getting into an argument with Wright, according to the complaint.
At some point, Christianson got out and fired several shots at Wright before fleeing as several bystanders began firing at the vehicle, the complaint says. Police interviewed several witnesses at the scene.
Prosecutors said that Wright and Christianson were both members of the Rolling 30s Bloods, several members of which had a falling out; the nature of the disagreement was unclear.
Investigators tracked Christianson and his wife to a hotel in Brooklyn Center after determining that the SUV was registered to his wife. After their arrest, authorities said they recovered two guns, a Glock 9mm handgun and an "AR-15 style" rifle.
Friends and colleagues said Wright worked for Change Inc., where he was part of a team of 10 social service staffers who mentor Black youth in St. Paul and was training to be a mental health practitioner.
After a turbulent childhood and early adulthood -- Minneapolis police records show that he was wounded in a shooting in April 2017 -- friends said that Wright seemed to be turning a corner and was working with at-risk youth to help steer them from gangs and drugs. One of his former supervisors at Agape Movement, a community protection program for the George Floyd Square area, told the Star Tribune that Wright was passionate about changing his life.
Christianson, 31, remained jailed on $1 million bond pending his initial court appearance Tuesday. He didn't have an attorney listed in court records as of Monday afternoon.
Cup Foods, the convenience store where the shooting happened, was thrust into the international spotlight last year as the scene of the killing of George Floyd, and in the ensuing months the surrounding area has turned into a memorial for Floyd and other victims of police violence. City officials recently announced they will not attempt to reopen the intersection during the ongoing murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with Floyd's death, in response to concerns from some neighbors and business owners.

A CRY FOR HELP AS VIOLENCE PLAGUES 38TH AND CHICAGO

Full text: Two women had to hit the sidewalk as gunshots popped off during the day outside Finish Touch Boutique, a store near the south barricade of George Floyd Square, shop owner Willie Frazier said. Frazier's car was stolen from the square recently, too, he said, and it later turned up at the impound lot with the hood smashed.
Now Frazier is sending a distress call along with other Black business owners whose shops and restaurants have been cut off from the outside world by concrete barricades guarded by civilian gatekeepers surrounding 38th Street and Chicago Avenue. As violence disrupts the once-peaceful memorial where Floyd died during an encounter with Minneapolis police, the business owners said they felt abandoned by a city that has failed to protect their safety and livelihoods.
"Last year when it first started, it was all about George [Floyd]. People came from all over the world," Frazier said. "We didn't know when it was closed that it would be closed this long. … And when everybody in town found out that it was locked down like this … nobody wanted to come here and risk this stuff, and I don't blame them."
City Council Member Alondra Cano pushed for reopening the intersection before the first snowfall.
"I get to hear from all the people no one wants to listen to," she said. "I get to hear from the Black elderly woman who has to sleep in her bathtub so she can avoid being shot at night. I get to hear from the other Black elderly woman who has chronic pain and can't access the bus and therefore can't go grocery shopping, and I get to hear from the residents who text me when there's bullets zinging by their faces in the middle of the day as they're gardening."
After bystander video of then-police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck went viral, the city installed concrete barriers to prevent cars from colliding with mourners. The area evolved into a protest zone, and committed activists have guarded the barricades ever since while taking care of the Floyd memorial in front of the Cup Foods convenience store.
George Floyd Square has drawn well-wishers from all over the world. But trouble hasn't left the area.
"This was Bloods territory," said Pastor Curtis Farrar of Worldwide Outreach for Christ, which sits across the intersection. "A lot of the gangs are right over there now. A lot of people that go to this church used to be in that gang, drug dealers and all of that."
Police can and sometimes do access the square, but protesters there do not welcome them. Agape, a peacekeeping force whose staff includes ex-gang members from the neighborhood, is on contract with the city to keep watch over the area.
On March 6, two people were shot there, and 30-year-old Imez Wright, a mentor for Black youth in St. Paul, was killed.
"I know that may be difficult for some people who have been holding space in there since last year, but we have to open up that intersection," pleaded Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who grew up blocks away from 38th and Chicago, at a subsequent news conference.
Protesters temporarily closed George Floyd Square for mourning despite its tendency to serve as a community gathering space through the Chauvin trial. Business owners and residents say tensions on the block remain high with sporadic gunshots.
"I am afraid. I am frustrated. I am mentally ill right now," said Dwight Alexander through the takeout window of Smoke in the Pit, jabbing his temples with the tips of his index fingers for emphasis. "I have to set my mind every day to come up here and try and make a way for my family, and [the city] took away my rights, they took away my finances. How do you think I feel? Put yourself in my shoes or my family's shoes."
At 58, he is one of the eldest business owners on the block, with 11 grandchildren and a great-grandchild on the way. Lest anyone be confused about his position on the barricades, last summer Alexander commissioned a mural across the front of his barbecue shop reading, "In times of crisis, the wise build bridges while the foolish build barriers," from the movie "Black Panther."
"We just need these streets to open, we need police in this area," said Just Turkey owner Sam Willis Jr. "This is like Mexico in the United States. Thirty-seventh Street is the United States. You come out here, it's like Mexico. So a person can commit a crime on 37th Street, and if they run over here, the police are not going to come. They park stolen cars here."
The occupying protesters open the barricades for delivery drivers and want the city to "establish a contingency fund for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color businesses located in George Floyd Square" as one of their 24 demands for ceding the street.
Still, business owners complain the protesters don't order enough, and some make unilateral decisions to jettison outsiders.
City officials recently announced they will not attempt to reopen the intersection during the Chauvin trial. But Mayor Jacob Frey is asking residents to weigh in on designs for a permanent memorial that will stand off to the side of two-way traffic with restored public transit.
The Black business owners at the intersection have received no direct assistance from the city to offset the impact of officials' decisions. They started a GoFundMe page and threatened to sue the state for taking their tax dollars without providing basic services.
Some unexpected relief came Friday when Floyd's family announced they had reached a $27 million wrongful death settlement with the city. They will dedicate $500,000 to 38th and Chicago so that Black-owned businesses can "not only survive, but … thrive," said the family's lawyer, Ben Crump, who challenged others to match the donation.
Members of Floyd's family, Council Member Andrea Jenkins and a throng of onlookers visited Floyd's memorial Friday evening. Floyd's brothers knelt at the spot where he spoke his last words, then visited each Black-owned business in turn.
Rashad West opened Dragon Wok at the start of the pandemic, but COVID-19 has been the least of his problems, he said. The last time people dined in, there was a shooting outside and people had to dive under tables.
He has said he felt like a "sacrificial lamb" to the impasse at 38th and Chicago, with his path to generational wealth blocked off.
"It's been a long year. We've been through a lot. I'm sorry for your loss," an emotional West told the Floyd family on Friday. "We're here to stay. We want to let you know we're not going anywhere. We're going to be here as long as we can."
"Help is on the way," vowed Jenkins.

Police chase passes through Floyd Square: A bystander posted a video of the incident on social media.

Full text: Three suspects led Minneapolis police on a vehicle chase Friday night that passed through George Floyd Square.
When the pursuit ended about 2 miles from its starting point, three suspects were arrested, one with a gunshot wound to the hand, police said. No shots were fired by police.
The chase began about 10 p.m. when officers heard shots coming from a vehicle near E. Franklin Avenue and S. Chicago Avenue. When they tried to stop it, the driver fled.
At one point the driver, followed by police, crossed through George Floyd Square, a memorial site at the intersection of E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where George Floyd died in police custody on May 25.
A bystander's video posted on Instagram shows a tan pickup truck passing through the square, followed by five squad cars. Some commenting on Instagram expressed suspicion that the incident was staged, pointing out that in a still shot taken from the video, the driver is smiling.
The intersection is considered a sacred space by many people. It's frequently the site of prayer gatherings, as it was Saturday morning.
Earlier Friday, Minneapolis leaders agreed to pay $27 million to Floyd's family, settling a lawsuit against the city and the ex-officers involved in Floyd's death. The family pledged to donate $500,000 of the sum to Black-owned businesses near the square.
Just four days earlier, a murder trial began for Derek Chauvin, one of the ex-officers accused of killing him.
Police spokesman John Elder said the route was set by the suspects, not the officers chasing them. "We pursued violent felony suspects that fled from us to that area," he said in an e-mail. "Our officers pursued. We didn't determine the path of travel."
The vehicle stopped near E. 38th Street and Elliot Avenue, he said, a couple of blocks from George Floyd Square. The three people inside were arrested. One had a noncritical gunshot wound to the hand and was taken by ambulance to HCMC. The driver, a man, was arrested.
Two handguns were recovered from inside the vehicle, Elder said.
Elder said he could not verify that the bystander's video was completely authentic, but the suspect vehicle and lead police squad car in it were captured accurately. He said the driver was smiling because "this was a big joke to him." Drivers who lead police on chases "think it's sport," he said.
In a separate incident, a man and a woman were shot and wounded early Saturday at Nicollet Avenue and 14th Street, police said. No arrests have been reported.

Full text: The teenager who recorded the viral video of Derek Chauvin detaining George Floyd at a Minneapolis street corner has taken to social media to open up for the first time about what she documented in her neighborhood nearly 10 months ago.
As jury selection moved along this week in the fired police officer's murder trial, Darnella Frazier turned to the same outlet she used in posting the cellphone video in late May and wrote: "If you think Derek Chauvin was 'just doing his job' YOU'RE A PART OF THE PROBLEM."
She added in her Facebook posting Thursday that "George Floyd was already cuffed on the ground, a knee to the neck when you're already restrained is absolutely unnecessary. ... That man was begging for his life and Chauvin did not care. He deserves to go down."
The 18-year-old high school senior is listed as a potential witness in the trial, which is scheduled to begin March 29. The defense is expected to argue that Floyd's death was caused by underlying health conditions and fentanyl and methamphetamines found in his system.
"I can't go to sleep in silence, my mind will eat me alive," she posted on Facebook at 4:17 a.m. Tuesday.
Frazier has turned down all news media requests for an interview, other than telling the Star Tribune the day after her video was posted that "the world needed to see what I was seeing. Stuff like this happens in silence too many times."
In Thursday's posting, Frazier also suggested that her video exposed what she said was a false characterization that police initially painted of Floyd dying from a "medical incident during [a] police interaction." She then scolded the Twin Cities news outlets that initially repeated what law enforcement offered.
"I still can't get over how quick the news tried to cover up George Floyd's death," Frazier wrote. "Just makes me think what else got covered up if [there] was no evidence to see what really happened."
In December, Frazier received the prestigious Benenson Courage Award from PEN America from Oscar-winning director Spike Lee in a virtual ceremony that included recognition from other notables.
Frazier accepted her award in virtual fashion and said from her living room couch, "I never would imagine out of my whole 17 years of living that this will be me. … It's just a lot to take in."

Full text: A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit alleging that Minneapolis police used excessive force on protesters in the days after George Floyd's death can move forward in court.
U.S. District Judge Susan Nelson denied motions by the city of Minneapolis and Lt. Bob Kroll, former Minneapolis police union president, to dismiss the suit. The suit, filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU-MN) and several law firms, has five plaintiffs: Twin Cities attorney and activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, Marques Armstrong, Terry Hempfling, Rachel Clark and Max Fraden.
The court found that the case "plausibly alleges that an unofficial custom regarding the use of unconstitutional force against peaceful protesters existed at the time of the George Floyd protests, and that the custom was either tacitly authorized by municipal policymakers or policymakers were deliberately indifferent to it," according to the ruling.
However, Nelson allowed Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matthew Langer and state Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington to be dropped from the case. The allegations against the patrol did not "plausibly allege constitutional violations," she wrote.
The court also dismissed allegations against Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo in his individual capacity, but allowed the allegations to stand in his official capacity. That means Arradondo cannot be held personally responsible, but his employer can be, according to ACLU-MN staff attorney Isabella Nascimento.
"We're feeling really good about the decision," she said.
All five plaintiffs were out protesting following Floyd's death and suffered injuries including bruising from projectiles and eye and vocal issues from tear gas, the lawsuit says. It alleges that the Minneapolis Police Department and the State Patrol used unnecessary and excessive force to suppress First Amendment rights to peacefully assemble.
The suit also says that law enforcement officers fired without giving warning or ordering protesters to leave and that in a few cases when officers did, protesters weren't given enough time to comply.
In an ACLU news release Friday, Nascimento wrote, "Police are supposed to protect and serve, not fire tear gas and hard foam bullets at people while they are peacefully protesting. It is particularly outrageous that people out protesting police violence and the murder of George Floyd by MPD were met by more police violence at the hands of MPD."

Record $27M for Floyd family: Minneapolis settlement called largest of its kind in country

Full text: Minneapolis leaders on Friday agreed to pay a record $27 million to settle a lawsuit brought by George Floyd's family, closing the civil case just as the murder trial for one of the ex-officers accused of killing him is beginning.
Attorneys for the Floyd family hailed it as the largest pretrial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death lawsuit in U.S. history, saying the payout sent a powerful statement about the value of Black lives in America.
"This is a message that the unjust taking of Black life will no longer be written off as trivial, unimportant or unworthy of consequences," attorney Ben Crump said during a news conference Friday afternoon.
The family's legal team voiced hope that the agreement will push policymakers across the country to institute policing reforms to avoid having to write large checks for law enforcement misconduct. Floyd's death on a Minneapolis street corner triggered worldwide protests over racism and police brutality and has already changed laws on police procedures in Minnesota and beyond.
The payout surpasses the previous $20 million record for Minneapolis. That sum was awarded in 2019 in the case of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a white woman killed by a Black officer after she reported a possible assault in a nearby alley.
Including the Floyd settlement, Minneapolis will have spent at least $71 million in the past 15 years to settle officer misconduct claims or lawsuits. The payments, and a slew of PTSD claims made by officers who responded to the rioting following Floyd's death, will strain the city's finances.
The settlement made for an emotional moment for Floyd's relatives. They had been watching this week as jury selection began in the murder trial for former officer Derek Chauvin, who was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck until he lost consciousness. Family members say they felt his death could have been avoided if police had worked to de-escalate the situation.
"I think that I speak for myself and my family when I say that we would give the settlement back gladly to have George still here with us," said Floyd's nephew, Brandon Williams. "No amount of money can cure this pain, this heartache."
The Floyd family filed a federal lawsuit in July against the city and the four now-former officers charged in his death. They argued that the officers showed a "reckless disregard" for his civil rights by using deadly force in non-deadly circumstances and that the city engaged in a culture of "killology," failed to terminate dangerous officers and fostered a culture of racism.
The City Council voted unanimously Friday afternoon to approve the settlement, $500,000 of which will be used "for the benefit of the community around 38th and Chicago," where Floyd died. Mayor Jacob Frey's office quickly said he would approve it as well.
"We know that no amount of money can ever address the intense pain and trauma caused by his death, for George Floyd's family and to so many people in our community who are grieving," City Council President Lisa Bender said. "Minneapolis has been fundamentally changed by this time of racial reckoning."
During a news conference Friday, Crump praised elected leaders for the settlement, saying it will allow Minneapolis to be "a beacon of hope and light and change for cities across America and across the globe."
Attorney Antonio Romanucci praised the city for changing some criminal justice policies to prevent excessive force, but he stressed that the legal team would be working with the city to institute far more measures to prevent another death like Floyd's.
In addition to pushing for legislation that improves a police arbitration system that critics say makes it too difficult to fire bad cops, Romanucci said they would be working with the city to establish a panel to review each instance of force used by police; a quality assurance unit to ensure that the Police Department is strictly following new reforms; and an early intervention system to weed out officers with patterns of problematic behavior.
"If all of these are implemented, Minneapolis would become the model, and what a great thing that would be in the face of a historic and tragic death," he said.
The attorneys said they will be watching closely to see if Minneapolis leaders follow through on their promises.
"If you don't get policing correct, if you don't make these changes, if you don't fix the policies that are happening, then you'll be seeing us again because we are making sure that Black lives and Black value will be understood," said attorney Chris Stewart.
While they presented a unified front Friday to support the settlement, city leaders are engaged in a fierce, polarizing debate about whether to replace the Police Department or keep it and enact stricter accountability measures. The question could go to voters in November.
Minneapolis typically uses money from its self-insurance fund to cover such settlements, but that fund had already been depleted. City Coordinator Mark Ruff said during Friday's news conference that city leaders anticipated "some of these liabilities," referring both to the settlement and the PTSD claims, and had been working to build up reserve funds.
"At this time, we feel that we can confidently say … this settlement alone will not result in property taxes increasing because of that judicious nature of saving the money that is necessary," Ruff said.
City representatives didn't respond to multiple requests Friday seeking clarity on which reserve funds they would use to cover the settlement or whether city services would be cut as a result.
The timing of the settlement -- on the fifth day of jury selection in Chauvin's murder trial -- surprised some legal observers, who privately questioned whether it could make it difficult to select jurors or prejudice already selected jurors.
Others noted that judges can instruct jurors to disregard news about settlements.
City Attorney Jim Rowader would not comment on the timing Friday, except to say: "We're trying to be very respectful of the criminal proceedings that are now underway, and we're in the middle of jury selection, and I think it would be wise for all of us to refrain from commenting on something that is ongoing."
Opening statements in Chauvin's trial are scheduled to begin March 29.
He faces charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.
A trial for the other three former officers charged in Floyd's death -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- is set to begin Aug. 23. They face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.

Walker warms up to local artists: The center is taking steps to repair relationships.

Full text: To some observers, the Walker Art Center views itself as a renowned international institution that just happens to be in Minnesota.
Certainly, its relationships with local artists have been strained at times, but the Walker's new leadership is taking steps to remedy that.
In December, it trumpeted the recent addition to its permanent collection of 39 works by Minnesota artists, including Ta-coumba T. Aiken, Julie Buffalohead, Seitu Jones, Rowan Pope and Dyani White Hawk.
In January, it relaunched the online platform Mn Artists, a joint initiative with the McKnight Foundation that supports Minnesota's arts community through writing and relationship building.
And in response to the racial reckoning following the death of George Floyd, the Walker diverted $120,000 from its acquisitions fund to 10 Twin Cities arts groups led by people of color, who were free to use the money as they wished.
The Walker "is part of an international ecosystem but also a local arts ecosystem," said executive director Mary Ceruti, who took over two years ago. "I think a big part of our role ... is to be the nexus between the two."
The center has waded through several challenging situations with the community in recent years. Protests in 2017 over L.A.-based artist Sam Durant's "Scaffold," a sculpture modeled partly on the gallows where 38 Dakota men were hanged in Mankato in 1864, brought harsh criticism of the Walker for its apparent lack of sensitivity to local concerns -- in this case the traumatic history of Minnesota's Indigenous people.
Although the Walker has previously worked with local artists on high-profile acquisitions, there's much more to be done, they say.
Previous director Olga Viso commissioned Twin Cities artists Aiken and Jones to create "Shadows at the Crossroads," a series of seven artworks that the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden unveiled in 2019 after the dismantling of "Scaffold." These flat sculptures, scattered along the pathways weaving through the garden, represent various figures who made a mark on Minnesota history.
Twin Cities artist Pao Houa Her believes the Walker's recommitment to local artists, and particularly the Hmong community, feels like a step in the right direction. The center acquired a set of photos by Her drawing connections between life in Laos and St. Paul. She did question why it took the Walker so long to add a major work by Jones.
"I think they've definitely made real steps to engage with the communities that they serve," she said. "The steady incline has been wonderful."
Jones, whose long community-based practice resulted in his winning the McKnight Distinguished Artist Award in 2017, feels that the Walker continues to make some of the same mistakes it did 30 years ago, but that this time things could change.
"This is just kind of the Walker dipping its toe into the water," said Jones. "It really has to dive in deep … go off the deep end on it and really rethink what a contemporary art center is supposed to do.
"We have this grand opportunity during the pandemic, during this racial reckoning, to rethink our institutions ... to look at these art institutions and start to kind of right that ship. It takes a lot to turn those big-ass boats, but just to start to turn it."
Looking ahead
The Walker's distribution of funds to artists of color suggests another way the institution is trying to connect in smaller but significant ways.
Artist Cadex Herrera, best known for his work on the now-iconic George Floyd mural at 38th Street & Chicago Avenue, received $5,000 through the Minneapolis organization CLUES (Communidades Latinos Unidos en Servicio). He said the money came at the perfect time.
"What an honor and amazing help," said Herrera, whose work centers on social justice initiatives and visibility for people of color, immigrant and marginalized communities. He used part of it to help family members in Belize, who he said received zero relief from the government during these difficult pandemic times, and the rest of it for art supplies and shipping costs.
At the same time, receiving funds from an institution brought up feelings for him, especially after the "Scaffold" controversy.
"It's hard for folks who are people of color, immigrants. ... It's a tough environment to feel welcome," he said. "It feels like those spaces are not meant for us and you have to start with the art you're putting up on the wall."
Namir Fearce, an interdisciplinary artist and filmmaker from north Minneapolis, received a $5,000 grant through Juxtaposition Arts, where he came up as an artist. He'll use the money for his current film, "In This Wicked Womb."
"It would be silly to say it's some kind of radical change, but there is an interest, and where there is an interest there can be change," Fearce said.
For longtime Twin Cities arts organizations, the effort made a difference but there's still more work to be done.
"It's a minuscule percentage of the Walker's budget, but for artists, money with no strings attached is incredibly meaningful," said Lana Barkawi, executive director of the Arab-American arts organization Mizna. "It's a small step toward repairing harm that has been done over the years when institutions take from the local BIPOC arts ecosystem and don't give back."

Added charge lamented by some

Full text: The reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge in former police officer Derek Chauvin's case has some trial watchers disappointed.
Chauvin is again facing three charges in the death of George Floyd last summer in Minneapolis, including the higher charge of second-degree murder and the lower charge of manslaughter.
Civil rights attorney and activist Nekima Levy Armstrong said that the serious nature of the case carries a higher need for accountability and punishment than a third-degree murder charge.
"I have some concerns about the reinstatement of the third-degree murder charge, primarily because I'm concerned that it will give jurors an out," Levy Armstrong said.
For second-degree unintentional murder, prosecutors have to prove Chauvin caused Floyd's death while assaulting him. For third-degree murder, prosecutors have to prove Chauvin was acting with a depraved mind and with no regard for preserving human life.
State sentencing guidelines call for identical presumptive prison terms for second- and third-degree murder -- a prison sentence of 12 ½ years for someone with no criminal record. Maximum possible sentences vary greatly, though, and prosecutors have said they plan to seek an aggravated sentence for Chauvin above recommended guidelines because of the "particular cruelty" shown to Floyd.
Levy Armstrong said the circumstances of the third-degree murder charge don't seem to fit, though prosecutors likely want another opportunity for conviction.
"When you have a case of this magnitude, with a video that is this graphic, and you have an officer who is able to get away with the possibility of a third-degree murder conviction, it certainly will make it difficult for anyone else who was killed by police to expect that an officer would face more than a third-degree murder charge," she said.
Chauvin pressing his knee on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes goes beyond a typical case where an officer could say they feared for their safety and fired a gun in a split second, she said.
Michelle Gross of Communities United Against Police Brutality said that third-degree murder is often reserved for those who are not targeting a specific person: firing into a crowd, for example.
"I have concerns. I don't think the charge actually fits. If you look at the elements of the charge, this is a charge that's really meant for people who engage in conduct that they know is likely to result in a death but they don't know who the target is," Gross said.
Former Minneapolis police officer Charles Adams said he believes Chauvin would not be convicted of second-degree murder. "I think the third-degree is a case they can win. I think the second-degree was going to be very, very difficult to convict him of," Adams said.
Gross believes the added charge opens the case to a potential appeal.
The charge also has implications for the trials of the other three officers involved in Floyd's killing. If Chauvin is convicted on a lesser charge, its unlikely the others will face much of a penalty, Levy Armstrong said.
Regardless of the decision, it's a tough moment, Adams said. "Our city is going to be upset regardless of what the verdict is going to be," Adams said.

2 arrested in fatal shooting last week

Full text: Minneapolis police on Thursday announced two arrests in connection with the shooting death of 30-year-old Imez Wright at George Floyd Square last week.
At a news conference recapping the first few days of the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said two people had been arrested. He would not provide details about the arrests.
Police spokesman John Elder later said that he couldn't divulge the gender of the two people arrested or provide any other identifying information because the case remained "extremely active." He added that any further information would come from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.
When asked why the arrest was announced without detail, the spokesman said it was to demonstrate that the department is taking the case seriously since "people feel like we are not doing anything about 38th and Chicago.
"And so announcing that there were two arrests is extremely important even if we are unable to give additional information at this point," said Elder.
Hennepin County jail records show a 30-year-old man was booked Thursday on suspicion of murder, but it's unclear whether he is linked to the 38th and Chicago shooting.
Friends and colleagues said Wright worked for Change Inc., where he was part of a team of 10 social service staffers who mentor Black youth in St. Paul and was training to be a mental health practitioner. After a turbulent childhood and early adulthood -- MPD records show that he was wounded in a shooting in April 2017 -- friends said that Wright seemed to be turning a corner and was working with at-risk youths to help steer them from gangs and drugs. One of his former supervisors at Agape movement, a community protection program for the George Floyd Square area, told the Star Tribune that Wright was passionate about changing his life.
A preliminary police investigation determined that Wright and a suspect had been arguing when the suspect shot him several times and fled in a light-colored Suburban that had been struck by gunfire. Wright was pronounced dead at an area hospital.
At the news conference Thursday, Arradondo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned recent violence in the area of 38th and Chicago and said they are having daily conversations about how to reopen the intersection.
As they do so, they are trying to balance the desire to honor Floyd's legacy with demands from other residents who feel their safety is in jeopardy.
"How do we stop and prevent what's been occurring? We have to stay vigilant," Arradondo said. "I will say from a public safety [standpoint], we have to open up that intersection. And I know that may be difficult for some people who have been holding space in there since last year, but we have to open up that intersection. And we can do both. We can facilitate the tribute and recognition and honor Mr. Floyd and yet get that intersection back open. We're having ongoing conversations. There will be more today."
But activists and some residents say that the intersection where Floyd was killed has not only become a memorial for him and other victims of police violence, but that it also serves as a place of healing.
Last month, city officials announced plans to reopen the intersection, but not until the conclusion of Chauvin's trial.

New reggae anthem is timed to Chauvin trial: Minnesota music all-stars join to say "Enough."

Full text: Alongside everything ugly that happened since George Floyd died in police custody last May in Minneapolis, longtime music collaborators and renowned sidemen Ryan "Rion" Liestman and Michael Bland said they also saw a lot of beauty and hope arise in their hometown.
They're hoping to revive those positive vibrations in a new reggae song, featuring an all-star cast of Twin Cities musicians and released this week to mark the start of former officer Derek Chauvin's trial for murder.
As Bland explained it, "We watched our city come together last year, march together and help each other, people of all colors. We want to encourage everyone to continue sticking together -- even if [the trial] gets ugly."
The Soul Asylum and Prince/New Power Generation drummer teamed up with the Jonas Brothers band member and former Ry & the Rule frontman to write and record "Enough," a protest song that preaches love and unity.
To underline that goal, they brought together a diverse cross-section of local vocalists, including reggae vets Lynval Jackson (International Reggae All-Stars), Wain McFarlane (Ipso Facto), Innocent and Singing Tony along with funk-rocker Mayda and R&B singer Carolyne Naomi.
"We all agree: We've had enough," goes the song's refrain, which is set to images from the 38th and Chicago intersection and various Floyd murals in the music video now taking flight on YouTube.
Other lyrics include, "Free or guilty / It's gonna get filthy / You better believe / Roll up your sleeves," and "We need action now / People won't wait." The singers name-check cases of Black people killed by police, including Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor and Philando Castile, asking, "So many gone, how can we fill the void?"
A longtime follower and participant of the Twin Cities reggae scene, Liestman said, "I think this had to be a reggae song. Reggae has always been about social commentary and bringing people together around social injustice."
He and Bland wrote and recorded "Enough" over the summer and then came up with the idea to enlist the other vocalists -- "To exemplify how much these issues cut across race and backgrounds," the drummer said.
But they waited to release the song until Chauvin's trial started. "We just knew that the trial could maybe reignite everything all over again, and we can't have a repeat of all the damage that happened last summer," Bland said. "This is a call for people to think of intelligent, meaningful ways to use their power together and make justice happen."
For now, "Enough" will just exist as a single online, but Liestman and Bland ultimately hope to perform it live with all the participants once COVID rates permit.
"That will be a beautiful moment for a lot of reasons," Liestman said.

Communities of color brace for more trauma during trial

Author: Jackson, Zoe

Full text: Walking down a Minneapolis street to grab groceries for dinner, therapist Cherie Hanson and her son passed the Holiday gas station near their home, and they were jolted back to last summer.
Crime tape fluttered in the wind and the chop of a helicopter thundered overhead. Hanson watched her 11-year-old grow tense.
"You can see his shoulders going up, you can see his eyes getting big, looking at me like, 'What's going on?' " Hanson said.
The family later learned that a man named Dolal Idd had been killed at the gas station in an exchange of gunfire with police. At home, watching the news, they saw fear on their neighbors' faces as they told reporters that they did not want this violence and pain in their Powderhorn Park neighborhood -- not again.
Months after video of George Floyd's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer shook the nation, any encounter or reference to violence can set off strong emotions, Hanson and other therapists say.
"This was a whole different situation, and yet it felt exactly the same," Hanson said.
Such trauma responses are likely to surface as the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is underway, mental health experts say. It could hit especially hard for Black and brown people living in Minneapolis, who are exploring a variety of methods of coping and healing.
"When this stuff starts to come back up, when this trial starts to trigger those things that we remember from last year, I think there will be some acute pain," Hanson said.
In addition to the police killing of George Floyd and the racial uprising and unrest that followed, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected people of color at significantly higher rates than white people. Now, as Chauvin's murder trial is likely to drag on for weeks, many living in the city are approaching the livestreamed legal proceedings with trepidation, anxiety or even fear.
Traumatic events leave an imprint on our brains and bodies, Hanson said. Our bodies worked hard to keep us emotionally safe during an extended period of chaos.
In October 2019, Hanson started Canopy Health in Richfield, a mental health practice for clients of color. Facing high demand, the practice expanded rapidly to almost 20 providers. Nationally, just 1 in 3 Black people in need of mental health care get help, according to the American Psychiatric Association.
Those who had the opportunity to process the impact of last summer likely still have those emotions sitting inside them, said Hanson. But she said it's likely that many people have not had the luxury of taking time to mourn and let go.
Practicing restorative, relaxing yoga is one way to help people get through difficult times, said trauma-informed yoga instructor Marjorie D. Grevious.
"I think it's really important for us as a community, especially those of us who feel everything that is going on so deeply, to take this rest, because it takes such a stress and toll on our entire system, on our physical bodies," Grevious said.
Minneapolis artist D.A. Bullock created a multimedia art project he titled "Excited Delirium," a play on the controversial term often used by law enforcement for extreme agitation that can sometimes lead to death.
The trial represents an accumulation of trauma for the community, not one singular event, Bullock said.
"That accumulation is about more than whether Derek Chauvin gets convicted or not. It's more about all of the people who have come before, all the cases that came before. Most of them have not been adjudicated and really haven't even been addressed by the justice system," Bullock said.
People are concerned and steeling themselves to stay resilient once again as they remain hesitant to depend on police during times of trouble.
"I feel like people are going to rise to the occasion … the same way we did during the summer. I don't know how folks are taking care of their mental well-being and their mental health and their healing," Bullock said. "We're relying on our neighborhoods and our community healers and our community artists to try to pull that together and help with that. But I don't feel like we're getting a great deal of support from the system itself."
When Bullock was looking to bolster his own mental health, he didn't find a lot of places dedicated to Black people, he said. So he turned to his artwork. He sought to redefine "excited delirium" with movement, projecting images of a euphoric Black dancer onto buildings in Minneapolis.
"You could look at the same Black body and think of this term (excited delirium) and think of something entirely beautiful and wonderful," Bullock said.
He expects to open the second of four installations this spring.
Neighborhoods are also forming community support groups. Rita Ortega, a community leader in the Little Earth neighborhood and candidate for Minneapolis City Council, said she will be inviting people to come together digitally during the trial.
"People are scared, people are afraid," she said, especially with an increased law enforcement presence now that jury selection has started.
"People are really getting anxious about what that means for the community," Ortega said. "There's a lot of questions and a lot of anxiety around the whole situation."
Ortega said she doesn't want anyone to feel alone, especially if Minneapolis ends up under curfew, as it did last summer.
"I wanted to be able to create a space so people could be able to come together weekly during the trials, so people have a space to express their feelings during that time," Ortega said.
For those seeking coping mechanisms, Hanson suggests refraining from obsessing over the trial's livestream feed, the events surrounding it or the news.
"Engage with it in a collective way with others and in a fact-based way and then move on with your life. Keep living it as best as you can," Hanson said.
She emphasized the importance of having an outlet to engage with other people. "Reach out, draw from the collective, talk to a group of friends about it," Hanson said. "Attend an NAACP meeting where they're collectively processing it, really, really reach out to others. Don't get shut in. Don't suffer in silence."
Both Hanson and Grevious stressed the importance of self-care -- from meditation to cooking, reading or taking a long bath.
Grevious will teach free community restorative yoga classes on Mondays in March, and said she encourages everyone to begin and end each day with 10 deep, intentional breaths.
"You can actually do this at any time in the day," she said. "If you're watching the news and it's all too much … plant both feet on the ground."

'Spark of life' part of pretrial jockeying

Full text: One of the pretrial motions discussed before jurors arrived Wednesday focused on what "spark of life" testimony Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill will allow in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer in the death of George Floyd.
Prosecutors said they wanted to put up two "spark of life" witnesses to talk about Floyd.
The state Supreme Court allows "spark of life" testimony to show the victim as a living person, not merely a faceless victim. Generally, one witness and one photograph of the usually smiling victim are allowed.
"The idea is that the prosecution gets to show the deceased in life," former Hennepin County Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty said.
Ted Sampsell-Jones, a Mitchell Hamline School of Law professor, said prosecutors want to show him as human and make the jurors feel sympathy for him, his family, and the loss of his life.
Moriarty, who has more than three decades of trial experience, said that "outside a courtroom, it's important for people to understand who George Floyd was. But inside a courtroom, it's not an element of the offense."
Unlike most everything else the jury will hear at trial, "spark of life" testimony isn't evidence, so it's tightly controlled by the judge and carries risk for both the prosecution and the defense.
If the witness starts talking about "character traits," that opens the door to the defense bringing in the flip side, less flattering aspects of their character.
For example, prosecutors in this case might want to talk about Floyd's struggles with drug addiction, but that could allow the defense to ask about the extent of his illegal drug use.
"Spark of life" witnesses also bring emotion into the courtroom, so they're "directly contradictory to what the judge tells the jury not to do, which is base their decisions on emotions," Moriarty said. "I've seen jurors cry during that kind of testimony."
Cahill told the lawyers that he would allow "spark of life" witnesses to talk about Floyd being beloved by his family, but they cannot provide "character evidence" about him or refer to him as a "gentle giant."
The lawyers and Cahill will talk further about the parameters of testimony and the number of "spark of life" witnesses once the trial starts.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter.

THE TRIAL OF DEREK CHAUVIN: WHAT TO KNOW

Full text: Where is the trial being held?
The trial is being held in a courtroom on the 18th floor of the Hennepin County Government Center in downtown Minneapolis. The courtroom has been modified to comply with COVID-19 guidelines and allow for social distancing.
Who will be allowed in the courtroom?
Because of the pandemic, attendance in the courtroom will be limited to:
• Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill
• The jury. Cahill has approved up to 16 jurors, with up to four serving as alternates. The number will be determined during jury selection. In order to maintain the anonymity of the jurors, they will not be visible in the video feed.
• The defendant, former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin
• Up to four members of the defense team. Eric J. Nelson is Chauvin's lead defense counsel.
• Up to four members of the state's prosecution team. Matthew Frank of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office is the lead prosecutor.
• A judge's clerk
• A court reporter who will transcribe the proceedings
• One observer for the state. This could be a member of George Floyd's family or a victim witness advocate, who may assist the victim's family and help manage witnesses during testimony.
• One observer for the defense, which could be a family member or supporter of Chauvin.
• Two members of the news media: one reporter for print and one for television.
• One audio/video technician.
Where will the rest of the news media be?
The court has designated a media business center in the 625 Building, across the street from the Government Center, where up to 40 additional members of the local, national and international media can watch the proceedings via video feed. Unlike the two reporters in the courtroom, those in the media center can use their electronic devices to report news and post to social media. However, they will not be able to take photographs or record audio or video in the media center.
What measures will be in place to ensure the safety of trial participants?
The Government Center will remain closed to the public, including people who work there, except for those involved with the trial and a limited number of building support staff. The defendant and everyone else participating in the trial will arrive and leave through secured areas and be escorted to the courtroom. They will not park in public or be seen walking into the building through public areas. The county courthouse is connected by tunnels to nearby buildings, including the county jail. Neither Chauvin, who is free on bail, nor his attorney will be in areas around the courthouse accessible to the public during the trial.
Why are cameras allowed in the courtroom?
In November, Cahill ordered video and audio of the court proceedings to be livestreamed in order to fulfill "the defendant's constitutional right to a public trial and the media's and public's constitutional rights of access to criminal trials." He cited immense global interest in the case, limited courthouse space and COVID-19 restrictions. It is the first time a high-profile trial in a Minnesota state court will be broadcast live.
How can I watch the trial?
Video and audio feeds of the proceedings will be provided by Court TV. The Star Tribune will offer a livestream each day at startribune.com. As a public service, our livestream -- and all coverage of the Chauvin case -- will be available free during the trial.

Tension, hope mingle as trial starts

Full text: The specter of fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial hovered over an anxious Twin Cities on Monday as legal proceedings began at the heavily fortified Hennepin County Government Center.
Crowds of peaceful protesters seeking a conviction in the death of George Floyd gathered outside the building in downtown Minneapolis. Worshipers prayed for the judicial system in houses of worship across the Twin Cities at noon. Neighbors of the former police officer expressed fears that last year's tensions on the streets will repeat themselves during and after the trial.
The drama surrounding the trial was especially poignant for Minnesotans who recall last year's visceral feelings watching bystander video of Floyd struggling to breathe under Chauvin's knee -- and also the days of rage and fear afterward, when the region erupted in protests and violence.
"Whatever outcome it is, each side is going to have their own spin," said Jake Jaap, who on Monday took his children to a park in Oakdale, the St. Paul suburb where Chauvin lived. "It doesn't matter who wins -- we all lose."
At the intersection 38th Street and Chicago Avenue,
where Floyd fell unconscious as Chauvin and two other officers pinned him down, a planned vigil and gathering of Black men were canceled following a deadly shooting there Saturday. The space, still blocked off and known as George Floyd Square, had been expected to be a place for a dynamic community gathering during the trial. On Monday, though, the atmosphere was quiet.
Outside the courthouse, which was surrounded by temporary concrete barriers, metal fencing and concertina wire, about 1,000 protesters gathered peacefully as court convened Monday morning. They chanted: "No more killer cops!" and "Ain't no power like the power of the people!" And they held banners: "The world is watching." "Justice for stolen lives."
Protesters there spoke of hope mixed with skepticism: Hope that a jury will believe the video of Floyd's death is so convincing that Chauvin will be convicted, but skepticism because historically, convictions of police officers are rare.
Bethany Gilmer, 32, remained hopeful Chauvin will be found guilty.
"We're often doomed to repeat ourselves," she said. "But hopefully this time something can change."
Outside the courthouse, Floyd's youngest sister, Bridgett Floyd, told reporters how emotional it had been to sit in the courtroom, face-to-face with Chauvin.
"My family and I are glad the wait is finally over and the day is here," said Floyd, visiting from North Carolina. "I'm hoping that justice prevails and we can all use this as an opportunity to be better and do better for those around us."
DeShaun McDonald, 36, took the day off from work to come downtown and to call for a conviction for Chauvin. He wishes more people would raise their voices to support the cause "I wish they would speak up for the injustice," he said. "Use your platform, use your privilege -- whatever you've got -- and speak up."
Away from the noise, activists displayed several pieces that were designed to make people think about racial justice. A large mirror spelling out the word "Reflect" stood on a quiet courtyard outside the government center, decorated in red roses and red paint that ran like blood down the mirror.
University of Minnesota student Justin Patterson, who plans to attend law school, said there's far too much injustice happening in the country for students to keep up with in school. "I'm tired of having to study this over and over again," Patterson said. "At the end of the day the justice system is us and there's not much we can do right now other than this [protesting] and continuing to expose the deep gaps our system has."
After one man died in a Saturday shooting at George Floyd Square, organizers canceled their planned vigil Monday.
"Our hearts are broken," the organizers wrote on Facebook. "We understand that there is an impulse to gather in-person during times of struggle and grief. We have been asked NOT to gather in person … out of respect for the grieving community."
The Agape Movement, a peacekeeping group contracting with the city to patrol the Central community, said the square will reopen for gatherings in a couple of days. "They're kind of letting the tensions die down, giving these young brothers some space to heal," said Agape co-founder Marquis Bowie. "You've got trauma on top of trauma. Things are heavy over here."
Bowie said that during the trial, Agape will pull back into George Floyd Square and focus more of their attention on the Floyd memorial than in past months.
"This is kind of like the protest zone," he said. "A lot of people like to come here and get their voices heard, get their frustrations off, and we allow that to happen to a degree. We don't want no negative rhetoric ... so we're trying to cut that, because that's not what we're about."
Twenty-five miles to the northeast, in the suburban Hugo neighborhood of retired Minneapolis police union president Bob Kroll, residents spoke of a different type of trauma. Neighbors recalled the tense months after Floyd's death, when Kroll's house was a spot for protests. As kids played hockey in driveways Monday afternoon and residents walked their dogs, neighbors told of protesters threatening to burn down their houses last summer. Several residents -- all of whom asked their names not be used -- spoke of the hope that the justice system will mete out whatever justice is proper. But they also fear a repeat of last summer's protests.
"What am I supposed to tell my kids about tolerance?" said one man who lives a few houses from Kroll, referencing protesters there that he considered threatening. "We tell our kids to judge the character of the person, not what they look like. And I told [an organizer of the summer protest], 'What you said and what you did created more racism and more divide than anything else.' "
Police officers have remained on edge since Floyd's death, knowing they are under a microscope. Former Minneapolis police officer Shawn Williams said he hasn't spoken with any law enforcement friends who consider Chauvin's actions acceptable. Now a criminal justice professor at St. Cloud State University, Williams has played videos of Floyd in class as he teaches students about appropriate use of force, a police officer's duty to intervene and how to prevent such an incident from happening again.
"I think the legitimacy and trust of the department is always on trial, but especially now," said Williams. "It's up to law enforcement to now show that professional face … day in and day out to try to win back the trust and legitimacy of the communities they're serving."
"I'm hoping that everyone involved allows the judicial system to just do its work," he added.
As she took her 19-month-old son, Aristotle, for a walk Monday morning in Anoka, Monica Bernal, 24, said the fortifications in downtown Minneapolis showed that the city is preparing for the worst. No matter the outcome, she hopes Chauvin being charged will hold police more accountable.
"If he doesn't get convicted, it's going to be hell," she predicted. "There will be more riots. There will be more destruction -- I hope not as much. … I'm worried people are going to lose more faith in the court system, and in humanity. People are going to be deeply hurt if he doesn't get convicted. It just shows that a cop can murder someone in broad daylight and there's no consequences."
At Redeeming Love Church in Maplewood, one of dozens of places of worship convening prayer services as part of a grassroots group called Pray for MN, parishioners whispered prayers for the integrity of the court proceedings, and for Floyd's family as well as for greater peace in the Twin Cities. Pastor Mike Smith led a congregation with several prayers for unity and security.
"Let's pray right now for the integrity of the entire judicial system," Smith said.

Full text: One man was killed and two men injured in three weekend shootings across Minneapolis, which is bracing for Monday's start of the Derek Chauvin murder and manslaughter trial.
The homicide happened close to the scene of George Floyd's death nearly a year ago, at the intersection of 38th and Chicago, now known as George Floyd Square.
The man died at Hennepin County Medical Center after the shooting around 5:45 p.m. Saturday.
Authorities did not release the victim's identity, but friends and colleagues identified him as Imez Wright, 30, of Minneapolis.
Wright worked for Change Inc., a Twin Cities organization where he was part of a team of 10 social service staffers who mentor Black youth in St. Paul. The Ramsey County program is funded by the state Department of Human Services.
He was training to be a mental health practitioner.
"It is a huge loss for our organization, our team," said Quinton Bonds, one of his supervisors. "Our team is like family. We lost a family member."
Wright had a tempestuous youth, with a long list of petty offenses, many of them traffic incidents. He also had a conviction for domestic abuse and another for the sale of narcotics in 2012.
Bonds said that Wright told him that he wanted to help steer young people in the right direction.
"He always said he wishes he would have known better," Bonds said. "He was very authentic."
Steve Floyd, one of Wright's supervisors and a co-founder of the Agape movement, a community protection program for the George Floyd Square area, said Wright was passionate about changing his life.
Few details on the shooting were available. Police spokesman John Elder said initial findings indicate that the victim and a suspect had been arguing. After the shooting, the suspect fled in a light-colored Suburban that was struck by gunfire.
In other shootings:
At 10:44 p.m. Saturday, a man was injured in Uptown in the area of Lagoon between Girard and Hennepin avenues. The man was taken to HCMC with noncritical injuries.
At 4:49 a.m. Sunday, officers responded to a shooting in the 2700 block of Upton Avenue N. A man suffering from noncritical injuries was taken to North Memorial Health Hospital. Police reported that the man was in a vehicle when he was shot.
No arrests have been made in any of the three shootings, Elder said. He added that the shootings have no correlation to the upcoming Chauvin trial, set to begin with jury selection on Monday, and that nice weather typically drives an uptick in crime.
Saturday's homicide is likely the 12th homicide in Minneapolis so far this year.
Elder said charges in Thursday's fatal hit-and-run in north Minneapolis haven't yet been filed, but if charged as a homicide, that would mark the city's 11th since the start of 2021.
A 54-year-old man was arrested in connection with the hit-and-run crash that killed 49-year-old Jerry Lee Johnson, according to a release Sunday from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office.
Johnson was killed at 5:55 p.m. Thursday when he was struck near the intersection of 30th and Newton Avenue N. The medical examiner stated the cause of death as multiple blunt-force injuries.
That case and the three shootings remain under investigation.

All eyes on Mpls. as Chauvin trial begins: Court ruling could delay jury selection

Full text: Jury selection is set to begin Monday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd amid fresh uncertainty as a new court ruling threatens to delay the start of the trial.
Even before jury selection begins, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill is likely to face motions to reinstate a third-degree murder charge and possibly postpone jury selection to give lawyers time to prepare for the new charge.
The Court of Appeals ruled late last week that Cahill erred in dismissing the third-degree murder charge against Derek Chauvin. The court asked Cahill to reconsider the charge, leaving an uncertain path forward in a high stakes trial being watched around the world.
Chauvin is facing charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death last May, an incident a bystander captured on video and broadcast around the world. The death touched off days of violent demonstrations in Minneapolis and across the country.
The latest trial intrigue comes at a time of intense and anxious scrutiny in the midst of a national racial reckoning over policing.
Community organizers seeking Chauvin's conviction have staged a handful of peaceful protests in recent days, but George Floyd Square, at the intersection of E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue where Floyd died, has grown increasingly tense. On Saturday night, someone was fatally shot at the perimeter set up by community leaders. Hundreds marched Sunday in Minneapolis, calling for justice for all people killed by police.
It will be the fourth time in modern Minnesota history that an officer has been tried for killing a civilian on the job, but Chauvin's case diverges on a key point -- it's the first time a white officer in the state is being tried in the killing of a Black person, an issue Black residents have long decried to mixed reception from the public, prosecutors and police.
"There's more than Derek Chauvin on trial here," said defense attorney A.L. Brown, who is not involved in the case. "The entire public -- in fact a great deal of the world -- is wanting to know if the justice system can produce justice."
Local attorneys, legal scholars and advocates said prosecutors and defense attorneys will have to overcome a host of challenges to win their case, which will also serve as a test of the criminal justice system in the wake of other killings involving police across the country that have gone unprosecuted. In a first for Minnesota, Chauvin's trial will be publicly livestreamed.
Jury selection begins at 9 a.m. Monday and is scheduled for three weeks. Opening statements are scheduled to begin March 29, with testimony to start that day and continue for two to four weeks. More than 370 people have been listed as potential witnesses; it's unknown how many will be called to testify.
Cahill will preside over the trial with Attorney General Keith Ellison's office leading the prosecution with assistance from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. Chauvin, 44, will be defended by attorney Eric Nelson.
Floyd was 46 and lived in St. Louis Park after moving to Minnesota from Houston to attend a drug rehabilitation program and rebuild his life.
Attorneys and law professors said the unusually high volume of video footage from police body cameras and the cellphone that captured Floyd's death, and the events before and after, will bode well for prosecutors, while the Hennepin County medical examiner's findings that Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest and had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system could play well for the defense.
They expect lengthy testimony from use-of-force and medical experts hired by both sides, and attempts to explain Floyd's cause of death given the autopsy results and opposing theories of the case -- prosecutors allege Chauvin didn't intend to kill Floyd but caused his death while inflicting felony assault by kneeling on his neck; Nelson has argued Floyd "most likely" died of a drug overdose and that Chauvin used police-sanctioned maneuvers to control him because he resisted arrest and acted "erratically."
"At the end of the day [cause of death is] what the big argument will be about," said defense attorney Andrew Gordon, deputy director for community legal services at the Legal Rights Center. "What the defense will ultimately try to do is muddy the waters about what it means for Derek Chauvin to have caused the death."
Medical examiner's report
Nelson wrote in court filings that Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker found that Floyd had no bruising on his neck or back, that the amount of fentanyl in his body was higher than in chronic pain patients and that his lungs weighed two to three times their normal weight due to excess fluid. Floyd was also positive for COVID-19.
Floyd posed a possible safety risk to the four officers at the scene of his May 25 arrest, Nelson wrote.
"What Mr. Chauvin saw was a strong man struggling mightily with police officers, which seemed contradictory to Mr. Floyd's claims about not being able to breathe," Nelson argued.
Dramatic cellphone video recorded by bystander Darnella Frazier is expected to play a central role. The video captured Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd repeatedly complained he couldn't breathe.
"I would expect that the prosecution is going to play that … tape as many times as they can manage, and it will be pretty devastating," said former Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner.
Yet the video could pose its own challenges. Floyd is heard on the video repeatedly saying, "I can't breathe," which many members of the public interpreted as signs of asphyxiation and contradictory to the medical examiner's findings.
Baker ruled Floyd's death a homicide caused by "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." He also listed "arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease" and drug use as "other significant conditions." He did not list asphyxiation as the cause, and found that there were no red spots caused by broken blood vessels in the neck, which can be signs of asphyxiation. Attorneys for Floyd's family criticized Baker's findings and commissioned an independent autopsy that ruled Floyd's cause of death as asphyxiation.
"It's the seminal issue in the case," defense attorney Joe Friedberg said of the cause of death. "If the jury cannot definitively decide that Chauvin's conduct caused the death of Floyd, the jury has to acquit him."
Past officer cases
Chauvin's case differs from the state's prior prosecutions of officers Jeronimo Yanez, Mohamed Noor and Brian Krook in several ways that could impact his defense: All of the officers at the scene were charged; there is clear video and audio of the incident; there is no weapon or perceived weapon on the victim, and Chauvin's actions lasted several minutes while horrified bystanders pleaded with him to relent.
Chauvin's three former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to be tried in one trial Aug. 23. The four were arresting Floyd, who was searched before he was pinned stomach-down in the street, for allegedly using a fake $20 bill at Cup Foods in south Minneapolis. All four, who were fired, are free on bond.
When other Minnesota officers were tried, their partner or officers at the scene took the witness stand and defended their actions by testifying that they can't second-guess colleagues and that officers are allowed to deviate from commonly accepted police procedures if circumstances call for it.
Through their attorneys or in direct testimony, Yanez and Noor said they were forced to make a "split-second" decision to use deadly force because they feared for their lives and other officers' lives. It is a phrase and defense that resonates with jurors, who often give police the benefit of the doubt because of the dangers of police work, attorneys said.
Yanez, who is Mexican American, was acquitted in the 2016 fatal shooting of Philando Castile, who is Black. Noor, who is Somali American, was convicted of third-degree murder in the 2017 fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a white Australian American woman. Krook was acquitted in the 2018 fatal shooting of Ben Evans; both are white.
Gordon said the video of Chauvin makes it difficult for him to argue that he made a quick and difficult call. "He has to explain the nine minutes. Maybe you get away with half a minute. Maybe you get away with a minute. But by the time you get to minute five or six or seven, that excuse goes away," Gordon said.
Yanez, Noor and Krook all testified at their trials. It's unknown whether Chauvin will do the same.

Hundreds march for justice near downtown trial site

Full text: Carrying bouquets of flowers and Black Lives Matter signs, hundreds of demonstrators marched through downtown Minneapolis on Sunday, demanding justice for George Floyd and other victims of police violence.
The crowd gathered outside the Hennepin County Government Center, fortified with fencing and concrete barricades, a sight not lost on demonstrators like Brandyn Tulloch, 24, of Oakdale.
"The city is preparing for the worst," he said, "because they haven't done anything over the last nine months. ... They do nothing to listen to the people who are out here fighting for our lives."
The march came one day before jury selection is set to begin in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is accused of killing Floyd in south Minneapolis on May 25.
Throughout the two-hour march on Sunday, six volunteers, some of whom were friends with Floyd, carried a white casket covered with dozens of fresh roses. A large, peaceful crowd followed behind, marching to songs by Bob Marley, Prince and Sam Cooke on the balmy spring afternoon.
At 8th Street and Hennepin, the crowd sat down in the street for a moment of silence while attorney and activist Nekima Levy Armstrong read from a list of every person killed by law enforcement in Minnesota since 1984.
"It's sobering, isn't it?" she asked the crowd after reading a fraction of the list, which includes more than 470 names and was compiled by the nonprofit Communities United Against Police Brutality, founded by Michelle Gross.
"The city had four chances to stop Chauvin before he put his knee on George Floyd's neck, and they did nothing," Gross told the crowd. "These are people whose families are left to grieve. These are people who will never complete their life's mission because their lives were stolen from them prematurely."
In the span of his 19-year career with the Minneapolis Police Department, Chauvin was involved in two other deadly encounters with civilians and two nonfatal police shootings. Seventeen misconduct complaints were filed against him since 2001, but he was only disciplined once.
Before the march, faith leaders prayed for justice, unity and integrity in the judicial system. A grassroots group called Pray for MN, which formed in the aftermath of Floyd's killing, now has more than 150 partner churches. The group's spokesman, Clynt Reddy, said the trauma Minneapolis residents endured last spring after they saw the video of Floyd's last moments might resurface. To offer hope and a place of healing, partner churches are opening their doors on Monday at noon to pray for the community at the onset of the trial.
Mohamed Ibrahim, deputy director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations, said Sunday's gathering was about community and reflection in the moments before the world again turns its attention to Minneapolis and the trial.
"We have to remember that a man lost his life, a family lost a brother, a family lost a father, they lost a son, they lost an uncle," Ibrahim said.
Ilyas Wehelie, 23, of Minneapolis, said he joined in a similar demonstration over the summer because it was "happening at my doorstep."
Saying that Floyd is one of many lives lost in police encounters, he added: "Maybe we should take time to reflect on how frequently it happens."
Meg Puckett, 35, of St. Paul, arrived at the march with a bouquet of orange tulips. She noted that Sunday was the 56th anniversary of Blood Sunday, when hundreds began marching from Selma, Ala., to Montgomery as a national outcry and turning point for civil rights.
"I hope one day all of us are afforded equal rights and security," Puckett said. "Speaking as a Caucasian person, I won't rest until everyone of Minneapolis-St. Paul has the same rights I've mindlessly indulged in my whole life. ... I'll do everything I can to keep fighting."

Riot-damaged businesses still struggling

Full text: Ahmed Muhumud, co-owner of Midtown Eye Care, sought refuge for the business last fall in the Midtown Global Market after it was burned down in the aftermath of George Floyd's death last May.
Muhumud is unsure whether his former landlord can or will rebuild along E. Lake Street.
"He terminated my lease and I haven't heard anything about plans," Muhumud said last week. "Business is still slow, but we're happy with our rent and to be at the Global Market."
At Hiawatha Avenue and E. Lake Street, pharmacist Elias Usso is back in business in a once-trashed building among hundreds of small businesses, disproportionately minority-and-immigrant owned, that were damaged and displaced by the riots in Minneapolis and St. Paul last May.
"We are one of the few lucky ones," said Usso. He raised about $250,000 to refurbish Seward Pharmacy from family funds, insurance proceeds and a grant from the Lake Street Council.
"There are small businesses that want to reopen but can't," he said. "Parts of Lake Street still look like a ghost town. We have to get Lake Street back."
Usso plans to testify soon before a state legislative committee that is considering a request by Minneapolis and St. Paul for up to $300 million in state bond proceeds to help cover more than $500 million in property damage.
Many of the old properties were underinsured. The Minnesota Commerce Department reported this winter only $163 million of $293 million in commercial-property claims were paid.
Philanthropy has led to pledges of around $20 million to help with commercial
recovery. The city of Minneapolis has pledged or spent several million dollars to help with demolition and business assistance.
Meanwhile, the business community is advocating for state funds and encountering resistance from Republican legislators.
"It feels like an intensifying animosity toward Minneapolis," said Jonathan Weinhagen, chief executive of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce, the largest state chamber. "It's sharpened in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd and civil unrest."
A just-released study by the Minneapolis chamber found that the city sent $3.50 in state taxes for every $1 it received in state aid since 2004. In 2017 alone, Minneapolis paid $1.97 billion in taxes to Minnesota while receiving $543 million in state aid. The seven-county metro area also is a net exporter of tax revenue.
The data was prepared for the chamber by MacCallum Ross, a Minneapolis consulting firm.
"We hope this data-based report provides useful information ... as policymakers consider investments to support small business,'' Weinhagen said. "The notion that the state is 'bailing out' Minneapolis is inaccurate."
The majority Republicans in the Senate say they shouldn't have to assist Minnesota's biggest city. They blame Gov. Tim Walz for being too slow to send in the National Guard last May to protect Lake Street and Minneapolis city leadership for being anti-police.
Minneapolis and St. Paul want the Legislature to issue $300 million in low-interest "redevelopment appropriation bonds" to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. Minneapolis would get $200 million and St. Paul $100 million. The agreement with the state would require the cities to keep the proceeds in separate accounts to help acquire and rehabilitate damaged commercial property, beyond insurance payments and private investment. DEED would monitor the process.
The amount loaned to property owners and buyers "for redevelopment that rebuilds and retains existing small businesses and enhances economic opportunities for long-term residents" of the affected neighborhoods are not repayable for up to 40 years, unless an owner sells.
Erik Hansen, the city's economic development director, said the program also would help solve a long-vexing problem along parts of E. Lake Street and West Broadway. Commercial lenders often won't fully fund projects because valuations often don't support the cost of building and renovation. The city and inner-city developers have long struggled to find "gap" financing. The riot-related damage has widened the gap.
"A commerical-property development fund … is not double-dipping on insurance or a grant to people who don't insure," Hansen said. "We can help an investment with this loan and the fund gets paid back on the sale of a building and the owners pay over the years through increased business, employment and taxes."
Sen. Paul Gazelka, who leads the Republican majority in the Senate, said he's committed to help "the people of Minneapolis with safe streets and prosperity," but says he doesn't trust city officials to administer a loan program. He only would support a low-interest business-loan program that needy business owners could tap through DEED.
Metro business leaders long have supported statewide investments in good schools, safe roads and public health. A $250 million, well-run loan program to help local small businesses revive damaged urban corridors will help spur more private investment and benefit the state over the long term.
Last week, Reps. Mohamud Noor and Fue Lee, DFLers from Minneapolis, publicized their bill for a 10-person commission appointed by the chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court to review how local government, police and military responded in the riots. The bill requires DEED to use community organizations to serve areas damaged by the unrest and provide loans of up to $500,000 to "entities" in them.

Full text: Man fatally shot near George Floyd Square
A man was fatally shot Saturday evening near E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, the Minneapolis intersection known as George Floyd Square, where Floyd died in police custody last May. Police spokesman John Elder said police got a ShotSpotter notification about 5:45 p.m., and 911 callers reported that two people had been shot and were being brought to the barricades at the area's entrance. When officers arrived, the victim was already gone.
Police later learned that the victim, a man believed to be in his 30s with a gunshot wound, had been taken to HCMC, where he died. No second victim appeared, Elder said. "Officers were met with some interference" when they arrived at the square to investigate, Elder said, without giving details. He said that officers' body cameras may provide more information. Investigators' initial findings are that the victim and a suspect had a verbal disagreement and the suspect shot the victim before fleeing, heading north in a light-colored Suburban with gunshot damage. "This appeared to be a very directed attack or assault," Elder said. "They had an argument. And so, it appears that there may have been some previous knowledge of one another."
Pedestrian killed in Crystal is identified
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday identified a pedestrian who died Thursday when he was hit by a vehicle in Crystal. David Arthur Jones, 66, of Golden Valley, was struck just after noon in the 5300 block of N. 36th Avenue.
Wabasha County death investigated
A 44-year-old man is jailed after his 77-year-old father was found dead Friday in rural Wabasha County. Deputies were called to a residence on County Road 6, near Zumbro Falls, at 6:18 p.m., the Sheriff's Office said. They found Edward William Riley dead of undisclosed causes. His son was later jailed pending charges.
Bloomington house fire victim ID'd
A man killed Wednesday in a house fire in Bloomington was identified Saturday by authorities. Firefighters pulled Jerome D. Halvorson, 77, from his burning home in the 7400 block of Landau Drive but were unable to revive him. A dog also died in the fire.

Fences send a racial message

Full text: Smoke billowed into the brisk Minnesota air from fires set by the reckless individuals responsible for costly damage. Some of them flipped cars, encouraged by the absence of police officers, who'd retreated. I watched as a collection of agitators jumped onto a man's car and tried to pull him from his vehicle before he reversed at high speed, nearly colliding with onlookers.
The city was aflame.
In 2003, a Homecoming riot on the Minnesota State University, Mankato, campus resulted in multiple injuries and 45 arrests. The offenders were mostly white, drunk on alcohol and privilege. The story made national headlines, but it did not lead to longstanding outrage.
Nothing about rioting is cultural. But you would not know that if you perused the recent headlines centering on the buildup of law enforcement officers, security fencing and proposals seemingly aimed at minimizing protests throughout the Twin Cities ahead of Derek Chauvin's trial. The collective message seems clear: What if these Black folks and their allies get angry again?
Last year's disturbance caused more than $500 million in damage across the Twin Cities. Businesses owned by residents of all backgrounds and ethnicities suffered. Yet, the reactions to riots often involve excessive policing and limited empathy, especially for Black and brown demonstrators.
Most people who protested the killing of George Floyd, however, chose peaceful gestures and were not culpable for that devastation. And the pool of the most destructive individuals was racially diverse. Per the Washington Post, most of the 570 arrests were for curfew violations and "all but 44" cases were dropped. Thousands poured onto Twin Cities streets in solidarity to fight injustice last May, not to commit crimes, as the numbers prove.
With authorities amassing resources and manpower ahead of the Chauvin trial, I worry that the effort to avoid riots and protect businesses will center on suppressing the emotions of a traumatized community rather than identifying those directly responsible for indiscriminate destruction.
"The message seems to be that few lessons were learned from George Floyd's killing and the protests in the summer
of 2020," said Matthew Delmont, a Minneapolis native and Dartmouth University's Sherman Fairchild distinguished professor of history. "Black people are anxious and angry because the justice system rarely delivers justice in cases of police violence. If city officials can only understand these concerns as potentially criminal, and therefore justifying more policing, it will be impossible to build community relationships that ensure the city is safe for all of its citizens."
Ten months ago, I thought we'd all agreed that justice -- and the sweeping changes it demands -- would be good for everyone. Now, it appears the hope, by some in positions of power, is to discourage Black folks and their allies from any form of protest because they believe that alone could pose a significant threat.
Dozens of people gathered on a Monday night Zoom to discuss a since-scrapped St. Paul City Council proposal that would have required groups of five or more people to have a permit and would have banned shields and other items from public gatherings and parades. Those gathered viewed it as a way to deter minorities and their allies from protesting during Chauvin's trial.
They said they felt "silenced" and "targeted." They also talked specifically about the ban on shields that could put protesters in danger if they have to protect themselves. The diverse group also cited concerns about who would face the brunt of local law enforcement's buildup months after peaceful protesters, journalists, volunteers and others were struck by rubber bullets in the days that followed Floyd's death.
"With use-of-force laws, where are the rules or regulations for using Mace?" said Chauntyll Allen, director of the St. Paul school board and an organizer with Root & Restore St. Paul, which arranged the protest against the proposal. "What is the criteria for shooting someone with a rubber bullet?"
It is not up to the protesters to separate themselves from the opportunists who might view the coming weeks as a stage for more damage. That's on the authorities, who must draw the critical line between those who present a true threat and those who are simply tired of waking up to read about another unarmed Black man or woman dying during an encounter with police.
They are not the same. But if that line isn't drawn and respected, it could create more challenges for all involved as we await one of the most important verdicts in Minnesota's history.
After the riot in Mankato 18 years ago, local law enforcement officials quickly announced the charges they'd filed, mainly against students who'd done the damage, while clarifying that only a small percentage of the thousands who had been in the streets were guilty. They cited mass intoxication as the disturbance's catalyst.
But an opportunity remains for Minneapolis and its neighbors to illustrate real change with their collective response to upcoming demonstrations. This can become a place where those upset about police killings and the injustice attached to them can raise their voices and their fists without facing the same consequences as those who choose violence.
It can become a place where people of all backgrounds can protest outside a courthouse in Minneapolis in the coming weeks to hold the power brokers accountable for their promises and commitments -- and still feel safe.
"We've been peacefully protesting for years," Allen said. "Why, all of a sudden, is there this emphasis like we're the dangerous ones?"

Chauvin trial challenges transit: But downtown service will continue if possible.

Author: Moore, Janet; Harlow, Tim

Full text: Transit service in downtown Minneapolis will continue "whenever possible," officials said, during the impending trial of a former police officer charged in George Floyd's death.
Jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin is set to begin Monday at the Hennepin County Government Center, home to several bus stops and the Government Plaza light-rail station. Metro Transit officials have been planning for a variety of scenarios in anticipation of protesters taking to the streets during the course of the trial.
The city and Hennepin County for now have erected extensive barricades and fencing by the courthouse, leaving enough room for the Green and Blue light-rail lines to operate.
Some bus detours for Routes 14, 94, 134, 353, 363, 663, 721 and 764 have already gone into effect, and more may follow depending on the course of events.
"It doesn't make sense to activate [more detours] before they're needed, but we will be ready to go," said Brian Funk, Metro Transit's deputy chief of bus operations.
If a protest spills onto light-rail tracks downtown, for example, Metro Transit can stop trains at U.S. Bank Stadium on the edge of downtown and replace light-rail service with buses.
Metro Transit customers are being urged to stay apprised of the transit landscape by checking the agency's Facebook and Twitter feeds or signing up for rider alerts on specific routes.
The primary mission during the trial, Funk said, is to protect Metro Transit employees and passengers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, transit service remains limited to essential trips for passengers, such as commutes to work and forays to medical appointments and the grocery store.
"We don't know how this will end up. We are definitely concerned about the safety of our workforce," said Ryan Timlin, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1005, which represents bus drivers, light-rail operators and other Metro Transit employees.
No transit workers were injured in last summer's unrest, but some property was damaged, including the Lake Street light-rail station and several bus stops.
Metro Transit police officers are part of a law enforcement consortium called Operation Safety Net to ensure "the public's First Amendment rights while protecting people and property."
"We're very much cued in to possible scenarios," said Metro Transit Police Chief Eddie Frizell.
Suburban transit providers have backup service plans as well.
SouthWest Transit officials say they have alternate routing plans they can roll out if circumstances get out of hand. Plans include splitting off buses that serve the University of Minnesota to skip downtown if necessary "so we don't have to drive near the courthouse," said CEO Len Simich.
There are options that would have downtown buses come in on Interstate 394 and run along 12th Street only (inbound) and 11th Street (outbound) to stay on the edges of downtown. It's also possible that all buses would serve transit stations in parking ramps by Target Field but go nowhere else downtown.
"We plan on running as long as we can. If we have to pull back, we will," Simich said.
Maple Grove Transit plans to run its normal bus service and use detours or adjust service as street closures and events require.
"We are, and will be, actively monitoring the situation and communicating with our riders regarding this topic," said transit administrator Mike Opatz.
The Minnesota Valley Transit Authority has been in communication with the city on potential detours, if needed, but has not announced any definite plans, said spokesman Richard Crawford.

Chauvin, Noor appeals intersect: Appeals Court hears arguments on adding charge in Floyd case; Noor conviction to get high court review.

Full text: The same day Minnesota Court of Appeals judges questioned arguments that Derek Chauvin shouldn't be charged with third-degree murder, the state Supreme Court agreed to review the conviction of another ex-Minneapolis police officer that could potentially affect next week's trial in the death of George Floyd.
Shortly after prosecutors asked the state Court of Appeals to reinstate the charge against Chauvin, the state Supreme Court agreed to hear Mohamed Noor's appeal of his third-degree murder conviction in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. Oral arguments are scheduled for June.
In Chauvin's case, prosecutors are racing the clock to reinstate the third-degree murder charge against the ex-officer, who already faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. In Noor's case, he is seeking to have the conviction dismissed and be sentenced on the lesser conviction of manslaughter.
At issue is whether third-degree murder can be applied to someone whose actions were directed at a specific individual and whether the Court of Appeals' ruling in Noor's case set a precedent that should be followed in Chauvin's case. Historically, the charge has been applied to drug dealers in overdose deaths.
Chauvin is accused of killing Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes last May. His trial is set to begin Monday before Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill. Noor was convicted in Hennepin County in 2019 of fatally shooting Damond, an Australian woman who had called 911 about a possible sexual assault behind her home. The cases of
the two former Minneapolis police officers are not otherwise connected.
At midday Monday, a three-judge panel of the state Court of Appeals heard arguments from Special Attorney for the State Neal Katyal and Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson regarding the murder charge. Prosecutors want the appellate court to reinstate the charge that Cahill tossed out then declined to reinstate last month.
Met with skepticism
The appellate judges seemed skeptical of Nelson's position. In a virtual hearing watched by more than 500 people, Judge Michelle Larkin told the lawyers to focus on the question of whether Cahill was bound by the Feb. 1 appellate ruling on Noor. Larkin wrote the 2-1 decision that upheld Noor's third-degree murder conviction.
Katyal argued for reinstatement, saying the Noor decision became precedent as soon as it became public.
When Nelson's turn came, he argued that the Noor ruling was being appealed and wasn't yet precedent. But the judges interrupted him often and peppered him with questions.
Larkin, who didn't yet know the Supreme Court had agreed to take the case, noted that the higher court could take a year to rule on the case.
"That means people could be waiting 12-plus months for final judgment and this court's precedential opinion in the meantime would have no affect according to your position … that's your argument?" Larkin asked Nelson.
Larkin asked if Nelson believed Minnesota prosecutors should stop charging third-degree murder in other cases until the state Supreme Court resolves the debate by upholding or overturning it. Nelson said that would be an "extremely rare" scenario but "technically" possible.
Katyal argued that Cahill's refusal to reinstate third-degree murder was "wrong on its merits."
At the end of the session, Larkin said the court would issue a ruling "as soon as possible" given Chauvin's trial next week.
'Eminently dangerous'
The language of the third-degree murder statute has caused many to debate whether the charge applies only when a defendant's actions put multiple people instead of a specific individual at risk and results in a death, or, whether it can apply when the defendant directs their attention at a single person.
According to state statute, third-degree murder applies when a defendant kills someone "by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind." Veteran attorneys have said it would apply, for instance, to someone shooting indiscriminately into a moving train. It is commonly used to charge drug dealers in overdose deaths.
More charges pushed
Prosecutors also want to add aiding and abetting third-degree murder against Chauvin's former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- who are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. They are scheduled to be tried in one trial Aug. 23.
Veteran attorneys and legal scholars have said adding third-degree murder to the cases could be a strategic move by prosecutors to give jurors more opportunities to convict the former officers, who were all fired and who are all free on bond.
In 2019, Noor became the first on-duty Minneapolis police officer convicted of murder when the third-degree charge was applied to him for "perpetuating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind."
His lawyer, Thomas Plunkett, who also represents Kueng, argued that the depraved mind element of third-degree murder wasn't met because Noor was carrying out his duties as an officer, acted in a split second and directed his actions at a specific person out of fear that his partner's life was in danger from an ambush.
It's unclear whether adding a third-degree murder charge could delay Chauvin's trial. Prosecutors have repeatedly pushed for a later trial, but Nelson has not. If, however, a new charge was added, he would be in position to ask for a delay.
Retired Hennepin County Judge Kevin Burke said it's typical for the activity to increase as the trial approaches. "Except for the fact that this case has media coverage on steroids, it's not that unusual to have intense last-minute jockeying," Burke said, adding that he expects that to continue through the week, including an appeal by the losing side on the issue of reinstating the third-degree charge.
But he still expects jury selection to begin Monday. "My own experience would be it's not going to get better and we could continue this to whenever and right before whenever we'd have motions right up until trial," he said. "It's kind of like a root canal, you've just got to get going."
Burke, however, wasn't convinced the appellate court would reinstate the charge. "This is a really close call in which reasonable minds can disagree about what to do," he said.
Given the Supreme Court's decision to hear the Noor case, defense attorney Ryan Pacyga said the Noor third-degree murder ruling is now "flimsy precedent" because the higher court will set the standard with its ruling.
He also expected the trial to proceed before the higher court rules. "There's no way this judge is going to say, 'let's wait another year' " to hold the trial, Pacyga said.

RODNEY KING CASE RESOUNDS 30 YEARS LATER

Full text: George Floyd and his childhood friends spoke of the video with astonishment.
The year was 1991, and images of Los Angeles cops beating Rodney King, a Black motorist, were sparking a national firestorm over police brutality. Floyd was a 16-year-old student in an impoverished Black neighborhood in Houston, a city with its own accusations of authorities using excessive force against people of color.
"There was a level of excitement, like finally it's caught on camera," said Floyd's friend Jonathan Veal, recalling their group discussions. "But then later, the verdict came back, the police were acquitted and there was just a level of disgust, shame and, really, disappointment in the justice system."
As the 30-year anniversary of King's beating approaches Wednesday, America is at another racial justice flash point: the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the white officer who pressed his knee on the neck of Floyd, a Black man, for close to 9 minutes outside a south Minneapolis convenience store.
King survived his assault. Floyd was pronounced dead soon after his encounter with Chauvin. Both incidents gripped the nation through the power of bystander videos that captured them -- amplified with the advent of 24-hour news outlets in King's case, and across social media in Floyd's.
Jody Armour, University of Southern California law professor, said the King video was the most shocking recording of police violence that people of his late baby boomer generation had seen. For his students today, most of whom were not alive in the early 1990s, the video of "George Floyd is the most shocking thing they've seen," he said.
King video hits airwaves
After midnight on March 3, 1991, King led police officers on a high-speed chase for 8 miles as they tried to pull him over for speeding. After King finally exited the car and got on the ground, onlooker George Holliday recorded a grainy video from his balcony of white police officers tasering, kicking and beating King dozens of times with batons.
The recording that Holliday shared with a local news station days later became the first widely seen video of a violent police encounter in modern times, playing over and over as national news channels picked up the story.
Herbert Mouton, a childhood friend of Floyd's, said teachers at Jack Yates High School showed them televised news reports about King and encouraged student discussion. Until then, he noted, the clips they watched at school featured police spraying Black civil rights protesters with hoses during the 1960s.
"We hadn't -- I hadn't -- seen police brutality to that extent until Rodney King," Mouton said. "It was very shocking."
The King video resonated more than 1,500 miles to the east in a Black community targeted by the War on Drugs and a police force that, like the L.A. Police Department, had a controversial history of its own. In 1977, the year that Floyd's family moved from North Carolina to Houston, the Washington Post published a story about how critics described the Houston Police Department "as the most violent and unchecked such force in the United States" with a "shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later" approach.
In 1981, amid tensions between police and Black residents, Lee Brown became Houston's first Black police chief and drew national recognition for instituting community policing.
Even so, a few of Floyd's friends recalled how Houston erupted in outrage over separate police killings of Black citizens Ida Delaney and Byron Gillum in 1989. The latter incident happened about a mile from Floyd's public housing project, Cuney Homes, when a white police officer shot Gillum in the back after pulling him over for not wearing a seat belt.
There was no video to counter the narrative that the officer told -- that Gillum had reached for a gun, which he kept for his job as a security guard. A jury declined to indict him.
Such incidents fueled skepticism of police in Floyd's community well before the King video surfaced. Floyd's friend Vaughn Dickerson remembered that people in the neighborhood would drive around playing Compton rap group NWA's 1988 anti-police anthem. Another popular group at their high school was the Houston-based Geto Boys, which came out with the song "City Under Siege" in 1990 that evoked Delaney's killing by off-duty cops who had been out drinking and lamented police violence with the lyrics, "Police brutality is now a formality/They're kickin' our ass and we're payin' their salary."
'We still had trust'
In high school, Floyd and his friends were busy playing sports and shied away from trouble. But Dickerson noted that they were growing up during the crack epidemic, when police assumed every young Black man was selling drugs and harassment and roughing up was routine. "Rodney King made history with us because what he endured is what we saw every day in the ghetto … officers beating, kicking minorities, that was a common thing," said Dickerson. Like many people, Dickerson recalled that he and Floyd thought the four officers who went on trial would be convicted.
"We still had trust and faith in the system," he said. "You're talking [about] teenagers, 17- and 18-year-olds. We're not understanding the biases and prejudices against Black people. We understood it -- we knew about slavery and Black history -- but we didn't truly understand the depth of it."
A mostly white jury acquitted the officers in April 1992; two of the officers were convicted of violating King's civil rights in a federal trial the following year. Jurors saw the beginning of the video -- edited out of TV footage -- showing that after being tased, King charged at an officer before the group began attacking him with batons. Officers said King had been resisting arrest and testified that they thought he was high on PCP, though he later tested negative for the drug and was instead legally drunk. He claimed to have initially evaded police out of fear of getting a drunk-driving charge while on parole for robbery.
The video in that case remained an aberration for decades until the introduction of smartphones and body cameras in recent years helped propel the Black Lives Matter movement.
'Part of history'
Like King's assault, Floyd's encounter with Chauvin might have flown under the radar without a bystander's filming. Darnella Frazier recorded Floyd's anguished cries under Chauvin's knee in a smartphone video that challenged the police narrative that he had merely had a medical incident.
The recording shocked the nation in a different way. It was lengthy. It did not end with bruises and fractures, but the last words of a dying man.
In the King case, one of the deadliest riots in U.S. history broke out in L.A. once the officers were acquitted more than a year after the beating. By 2020, the public was no longer ready to wait: People stormed the streets, rioted and seized the Third Precinct police station in Minneapolis soon after the video of Floyd emerged.
Armour noted that there had not been the same infrastructure of activism after the King controversy compared to the one established in the years leading up to Floyd's death: "Rodney King was more of a moment. George Floyd was part of a movement."
Stanford University law professor David Sklansky said that not only is the video of George Floyd better quality, "but we also have a better sense of the scale and nature of the overall problem of police violence."
Jurors in the first trial regarding King's beating have said they based their acquittal on testimony and evidence in the courtroom, and those in the Chauvin trial will face similar limits amid a public movement to deliver a statement against systemic racism.
When Veal watched the video of Floyd, he noticed that his friend called the cops "sir" and "Mr. Officer." It brought back memories of the conversations they had as teenagers about talking respectfully to police. As he, Dickerson, Mouton and other friends of Floyd prepare to travel north for the trial, they hope this time will be different. That a jury will convict.
"Just as people talked about the Rodney King experience and trial," said Veal, "I think this is going to be the same … it's going to be a part of history."
