NEW YORK — The Democratic candidates running for mayor of New York City differ on many issues, but they tend to agree on one thing: All aspire to be different from Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat in his second term whose approval rating dropped after his failed run for president last year.
On Friday, the city Department of Investigation released a report that sharply criticized the de Blasio administration for its handling of the Black Lives Matter protests earlier this year.
The findings were uniformly welcomed by the mayoral hopefuls, many of whom have been critical of the police tactics deployed. One went further, vowing to remove the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, if elected.
One other way they vow to differ from de Blasio? They say they will ride the subway more often.
Here’s what you need to know about the week that was in the mayor’s race:
Who’s landing the big political guns for hire?
The huge field of candidates running for mayor — as well as the City Council and other local races in New York — is expected to be a bonanza for campaign consultants, and some key hired guns have landed in some interesting places.
L. Joy Williams, the president of the Brooklyn NAACP, signed on with Raymond J. McGuire, a Black businessman. She was an adviser for Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist who ran for governor in 2018.
Williams could help McGuire, a first-time candidate, reach Black voters in Brooklyn, especially women — a critical constituency that will be courted by other Black candidates, including Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Maya Wiley, a former top counsel to de Blasio and MSNBC analyst.
Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, hired Rebecca Katz, a confidant of de Blasio’s who helped shape his image, but has been critical of the mayor recently. Katz has worked for progressive candidates, including Rep. Jamaal Bowman.
Wiley hired Alison Hirsh, who left de Blasio’s administration earlier this year and worked for the powerful 32BJ local of the Service Employees International Union; and Maya Rupert, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Julián Castro and Elizabeth Warren.
Adams hired Katie Moore, political director of the influential Hotel Trades Council.
But the competition is fierce.
Abbey Lee Cook, the campaign manager for Rep. Max Rose, who just announced his mayoral bid, already signed up to work with Tali Farhadian Weinstein, a former prosecutor who is running for Manhattan district attorney. A high-profile political firm led by Stu Loeser, an aide to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also working on Weinstein’s campaign.
Be like Bill de Blasio and ride an SUV? Not likely.
De Blasio has been criticized for not riding the subway regularly to see riders’ commuting misery up close, opting instead to view the city from the windows of his chauffeured SUV.
Admitting that he could do better, de Blasio told reporters last week that he would ride the subway soon, to show New Yorkers that it is safe during the pandemic.
But some candidates are pledging to do more. Shaun Donovan, a former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, promised to ride the subway every day. McGuire said in an interview that the subway is the “easiest, cheapest and quickest way to get around,” and that he would ride the subway as much as possible if elected.
Others followed suit after Streetsblog, a website dedicated to street safety, inquired about their commuting habits. Adams said that he was already a regular subway rider, and would continue to be one if elected.
Carlos Menchaca, a Brooklyn city councilman, committed to taking the subway or riding his bike while “significantly limiting car trips.”
It should be noted that Gov. Andrew Cuomo actually controls the subway, and is rarely seen aboard a passenger train. But the mayor appoints members to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees the subway, and can use his or her bully pulpit to help the system, which is in a deep financial crisis.
Being early contenders pays off for Stringer and Adams
The city’s Campaign Finance Board announced last week that it had approved more than $17 million in matching-funds payments to 61 candidates in races across the city next year.
The initial outlay underscored the advantages of establishing early candidacies: Adams’ campaign qualified for about $4.4 million in matching funds, while Stringer’s campaign received about $3.3 million.
No other candidate met the dual threshold of raising at least $250,000 in contributions of $250 or less from at least 1,000 city residents by July.
McGuire is not participating in the 8-to-1 matching-funds program, which effectively turns a $10 campaign contribution from a city resident into $90. Lupé Todd-Medina, a spokeswoman for McGuire, said the campaign felt good about not accepting taxpayer resources during a financial crisis and could raise enough money to get its message out.
But Paul J. Massey Jr., a wealthy real estate executive who ran against de Blasio in 2017, suggested that mayoral candidates like McGuire may regret not participating in the matching-funds program. He said his biggest mistake as a first-time candidate was deciding to opt out; Massey raised $1.6 million, but spent it quickly on consultants and lent his campaign $1.2 million.
“Being involved in the matching-funds program or writing checks the size Michael Bloomberg wrote are probably the few practical paths to financing a campaign for mayor,” he said in an interview.
A ‘monumental failure of leadership’
One candidate called for an elected Civilian Complaint Review Board and “massive disinvestments” in the New York Police Department. Another said the mayor demonstrated a “monumental failure of leadership.” And one candidate called for the dismissal of the police commissioner.
The reactions came in response to a Department of Investigation report that concluded that the Police Department’s use of aggressive tactics had inflamed the summertime protests over the death of George Floyd, and violated protesters’ rights.
The strongest reaction came from Dianne Morales, considered among the most progressive candidates in the race, and Wiley, a former chairwoman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates accusations of police misconduct.
Morales said the Police Department committed “acts of violence,” and called for “dedicated prosecutors” for police misconduct.
Wiley said the police used “brutally violent tactics” against the protesters, and called for the dismissal of Shea and a policy change that would require the police to be more accountable to civilian review.
Stringer, Donovan and McGuire focused on what they saw as a failure of leadership.
“When I’m mayor, I’ll make certain that my police commissioner understands my values and the perspective of people who look like me,” said McGuire, who is Black.
Stringer, who has collected a string of endorsements from progressive candidates, called for “wholesale reform” because the Police Department operated without “real accountability.”
Adams, a former police officer, had perhaps the most moderate view among the major candidates. He said the report detailed “tactical errors and acts of heavy-handed policing” and called for more diverse leadership and enhanced de-escalation and implicit bias training.
Lawsuit against ranked-choice voting suffers setback
A lawsuit seeking to prevent the use of ranked choice voting in the June primary was dealt a significant blow last week when a state Supreme Court judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order in the matter.
“This court is disinclined to take any action that may result in the disenfranchisement of even one voter or take any action that may result in even one voter’s ballot being nullified,” Justice Carol R. Edmead of state Supreme Court in Manhattan wrote in her ruling.
Under a new system approved by referendum last year, voters in primary and special elections can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority, the last-place winner is eliminated and the second-choice votes of those ballots are counted. The process continues until a candidate has won a majority.
But several members of the Black, Latino and Asian Caucus of the City Council have filed a lawsuit suggesting that voters had not been educated about the new process, and that people of color and immigrants would be disenfranchised as a result.
Two Black mayoral candidates, Adams, the borough president of Brooklyn, and McGuire, a businessman, both expressed concerns about Black voter disenfranchisement. Other Black mayoral candidates, Morales, a former nonprofit executive who is Afro Latina, and Wiley, support the use of ranked choice voting.
The ruling directly affects a Feb. 2 special election for a City Council seat in Queens, which is slated to be the city’s first contest to use ranked choice voting since the referendum was passed. Edmead noted that overseas ballots for the race were about to be mailed out.

Full text: In a world where life changed seemingly overnight, photographers transformed how they worked, trading intimacy for distance. This is what they captured.
By Dean Baquet, executive editor
Certain years are so eventful they are regarded as pivotal in history, years when wars and slavery ended and deep generational fissures burst into the open -- 1865, 1945 and 1968 among them. The year 2020 will certainly join this list. It will long be remembered and studied as a time when more than 1.5 million people globally died during a pandemic, racial unrest gripped the world, and democracy itself faced extraordinary tests.
The photographs in this collection capture those historic 12 months. Jeffrey Henson Scales, who edited The Year in Pictures with David Furst, said he had never felt such sweep and emotion from a single year's images -- from the "joy and optimism" of a New Year's Eve kiss in Times Square, to angry crowds on the streets of Hong Kong and in American cities, to scenes of painful debates over race and policing, to the "seemingly countless graves and coffins across the globe."
The impeachment of an American president culminated in early 2020. But two pictures taken in late January in Wuhan, China, are hints of a larger cataclysm to come. In one aerial shot, construction workers are building a giant hospital virtually overnight to handle hundreds of patients stricken with the coronavirus. The other looks like a still from a sci-fi film: A man dressed in black, wearing a white mask, lies dead on a city street; two emergency workers have stepped away from him and gaze at the viewer -- all but their eyes hidden by face coverings and ghostly white protective suits.
Then the virus swept the world, recorded in indelible images. The scenes of people comforting beloved family members through glass and cellphones are heartbreaking. Some of the most haunting images are of emptiness. Still cities. Vacant streets of London and the Place de la Concorde. A desolate Munich subway station. Among the most disturbing is a photo of a refrigerated trailer set up as a makeshift morgue in Greenwich Village.
Punctuating these scenes are photographs of a tumultuous American election that even without the ravages of the virus would end up looming large in history books. As the year progresses, fueled by police shootings of young Black men, powerfully symbolic pictures of protests begin appearing. In May, a lone demonstrator carries an upside-down American flag past a burning liquor store in Minneapolis, in protest of the killing of George Floyd.
In 2020, a year when all aspects of life seemed transformed, so was the process of making these photographs. Journalists are observers, not participants, but the most striking sense to emerge from interviews with the photographers who took these pictures -- described by Mr. Henson Scales as the most diverse group in his more than a decade curating this annual compilation -- was how much they too lived what they witnessed. No one could escape the virus and vitalness of 2020. It gave photographers fresh perspective. And they gave us unforgettable images from a historic year in our lives.

Full text: Simbarashe Cha photographed a march in Harlem, where he lives, on the day of a memorial service for George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Protesters in New York had decided to dress up in honor of the day since they couldn't attend the funeral in person.
"I was really proud of us as people of color who wanted to recognize and be in solidarity with Mr. Floyd's family," he said.
"I think this group stopped to kneel three times in different places in the street, and every time it just seemed like people in the neighborhood were very respectful of protesters taking up the space. And when they got up to the hill there was this cascade of people going up 96th Street. It was such an amazing perspective. When you're at the front of a march you never really know how big a crowd is until you move around, and everyone had stopped, and I could see everyone down the hill and it was breathtaking."
Simbarashe Cha spends most of his time photographing fashion, and this year was sad to miss the buzz of Fashion Week and traveling to shows across the world to gather with crowds to view the latest trends. He was excited to photograph the small show in the backyard of Christian Siriano's home in Westport, Conn.
"It was a bit weird because of Covid and there were not many people there. There wasn't the sort of industry turnout that usually accompanies shows. Even though it was a Covid situation it was one of the best fashion show experiences I've had. The intimacy and the relaxed nature of it -- you kind of got the feeling that Christian knew most of the people there or had a connection to them, so there wasn't this facade or air or any one person or group of people being above each other. There was no classism or hierarchy at the show."

Full text: Victor Blue worked with the New York Times reporter Sheri Fink at the start of the pandemic, documenting Covid as it raged through hospitals in New York.
"We realized pretty quickly the defining aspect of the pandemic was the number of people dying, usually with no one around them, no family members to say goodbye," Mr. Blue said. "We wanted to be in the room when someone passed from the disease."
In April, relatives of Carmen Evelia Toro, the matriarch of a family spread across Colombia, agreed to allow Mr. Blue and Ms. Fink to witness the end of Ms. Toro's life in her room at North Shore University Hospital.
"For me that was probably the most important event I photographed this year, or maybe ever in my career," Mr. Blue said. "It was the thing that photography does best, which is accompany people through the difficulties of our life and times."
"The hardest thing at first was so much confusion around the virus and what it meant for vulnerable people especially pregnant mothers," Mr. Blue said. "Everybody in the city was scared."
Mr. Blue had seen Precious Anderson, who was pregnant, on a ventilator in the intensive care unit.
"She was not doing well," he said. "It did not appear she was going to make it."
While Ms. Anderson was intubated, doctors delivered her baby by cesarean section, and within a couple days, Ms. Anderson improved.
"They brought in an iPad and this was the first day she had seen her child live on a video feed," Mr. Blue said.
"We were happy to be able to do a story early on that brought some kind of hope, that people could see there were folks who were surviving it," he said. "That wasn't the case for most people intubated."
On May 31, Mr. Blue was following protesters as they marched through Minneapolis in the days after the police killing of George Floyd.
Protesters came together downtown and made their way onto a major roadway, stopping traffic briefly. By the time they retreated, state troopers and Minneapolis Police Department officers blocked the marchers, encircling them and essentially penning them in.
"They just unleashed on the protesters. They just showcased the worst," Mr. Blue said. "The march was 100 percent peaceful. They shot protesters point blank with nonlethal weapons. I saw them shoot a man with a nonlethal weapon point blank in the chest. I was pepper sprayed in the face."
He saw police officers rush a car of young women that had been parked in a parking lot.
"They were trying to get out of the melee, and Minneapolis police officers surrounded the car and pulled these young women out of the car and pointed lethal and nonlethal weapons at them," Mr. Blue said. "These young ladies were just trying to get out of the way."
"It was a wild lack of professionalism," he continued. "It was ridiculous. I thought, wow, this is exactly what it looks like for tons of Black motorists. This was a scene right out of a cellphone video. The young woman, the fear on her face, it was insane. As part of the news media we can't be there for all the times this happens for motorists of color, but being there this time and trying to make something iconic, hopefully that lodges in people's minds for when we can't be there and are just reading about things like that."

Months after their pledge to dismantle the Police Department fell apart, members of the Minneapolis City Council voted early Thursday to divert nearly $8 million from the proposed policing budget to other city services, a move heralded by some as an important step toward transforming public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.
The shift in funds — about 4.5% of the proposed $179 million police budget — was not nearly the sweeping change that activists and some lawmakers had demanded in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in May. Still, Jeremiah Ellison, a city councilman who had favored more aggressive efforts to defund the police, called it an “incredible investment.”
“I think what we’re able to do with that $8 million is going to do a lot for public safety in our city,” he said.
The money will go toward bolstering the city’s Office of Violence Prevention, starting a team of mental health professionals who can respond to crises without the aid of the police and allowing city workers outside the Police Department to process minor complaints, such as parking violations and property damage.
The decision to divert the funds capped several days of charged, emotional debate over the size of the police force and the role of the department and came amid a spike in violent crime this year.
In his budget proposal, Mayor Jacob Frey suggested slashing last year’s police budget of $193 million by more than 7%. Council members went further, in large part by cutting money earmarked for overtime and other staffing costs. Trimming of those items raised alarm bells among the police chief and some lawmakers, as the department has lost 166 officers this year — some permanently, others because they are on disability, and still others saying they have post-traumatic stress from the massive protests that swept the city over the summer.
“I believe we’re at that breaking point,” said Linea Palmisano, chair of the council’s budget committee. “I’m very concerned that we are reducing our city’s ability to respond to 911 calls and do investigations well. I am extremely concerned because I don’t think that we can keep asking our current officers to work at the rate that they’re working.”
In addition to the diversion of $8 million, the council put $11.4 million in a reserve fund intended for hiring and overtime. The department will have to appeal to the council to gain access to those funds.
The council had originally planned to reduce the number of officers to 750, from 888, starting in 2022, despite a surge in gun violence in Minneapolis this year. Frey had threatened to veto the budget if the council approved such a measure, which narrowly failed.
“My colleagues were right to leave the targeted staffing level unchanged from 888 and continue moving forward with our shared priorities,” Frey said in a statement on Thursday. “The additional funding for new public safety solutions will also allow the city to continue upscaling important mental health, non-police response, and social service components in our emergency response system.”
Steven Belton, the president of the Twin Cities chapter of the Urban League, called the cuts to the police budget misguided and misinformed. He said council members made it an either-or proposition between funding the police and other services when he believed everything was needed.
The city’s roughly $1.5 billion budget is a slight increase over last year’s budget, although many city agencies were forced to take cuts.
The allocation for the Office of Violence Prevention, though, grew to $6.7 million from $1.5 million. Established in 2018, its aim is to prevent crime, deploying strategies such as having community members mediate disputes in their neighborhoods and having social workers meet with victims of violence at hospitals.
This year, the city has logged 5,164 violent crimes, up 25.7% from last year, according to data from the Minneapolis Police Department. The cuts to the police budget could embolden criminals to think that policing was going away, Belton said.
“It’s the wrong optics to the communities that are most impacted detrimentally by violence and the absence of policing and poor policing,” he said.
Across the country this year, violence has spiked in many cities, a rise experts say is likely the result of several factors, including the economic hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The loss of Minneapolis police officers cannot be blamed for the city’s rise in crime, said supporters of the movement to defund the police, a group that largely wants money to be diverted from police departments and directed toward other services it says could prevent or decrease crime. Supporters point to the fact that crime has been high when the Police Department had more officers.
“We are living among a Police Department that has wrought a lot of trauma and damage to our city,” said D.A. Bullock, a filmmaker who lives in Minneapolis. If the department felt like it needed more staff to make the community safer, he added, “they owe it to us to prove that that is actually an effective strategy.”
Residents in Minneapolis, especially Black residents, have long complained of a police force that they say exerts disproportionate violence against them. Minneapolis police have used force against Black people at a rate at least seven times that of white people during the past five years.
That violence against Black residents came into stark relief when video surfaced of Floyd, a Black man, with his neck pinned to the ground by a white officer while handcuffed on May 25. Floyd’s death led to widespread protests, in Minneapolis and across the country, against police brutality and systemic racism.
Less than two weeks after Floyd’s death, a majority of the Minneapolis City Council pledged to dismantle the Police Department and create a new system of public safety.
After an attempt to change the city charter to allow for the elimination of the Police Department failed, some council members backtracked on their pledge. The most far-reaching policy reforms in Minneapolis did not move forward.
“I think our pledge created confusion in the community and in our wards,” Lisa Bender, the council president, said in September when asked if the council’s statement had led to uncertainty at a pivotal moment.
Instead of larger policing changes, Minneapolis agreed to ban chokeholds and passed several reforms, including a revamped use-of-force policy.
Residents in Minneapolis had mixed opinions about the council’s efforts to change how the police force runs. On the city’s North Side, which has a majority Black population, residents have complained about mistreatment, but also about rampant crime.
The Police Department’s 4th Precinct, which covers North Minneapolis, has seen more homicides and violent crimes this year than any other precinct in the city.
“Our communities are in so much trauma now,” Andrea Jenkins, the council vice president, said at this week’s meeting. “We must try all the options to restore a sense of safety — of real safety — in our communities.”

LOS ANGELES — After George Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis this summer and America erupted in protest, cash started flooding the race for district attorney of Los Angeles County.
George Gascón, the former top prosecutor in San Francisco, seized the momentum swirling in the streets and honed his promises to reduce incarceration, tackle racial bias and reopen old police shooting cases that the incumbent had declined to prosecute. At his swearing-in ceremony Monday, Gascón immediately put his plans in motion, announcing an end to seeking cash bail and other sweeping policy changes.
Los Angeles, with the nation’s largest prosecutor’s office and its biggest jail system, was at the vanguard of communities, urban and rural, in liberal and conservative states, that went in the opposite direction of President Donald Trump’s law-and-order message last month by electing prosecutors who promised to send fewer people to prison.
The dynamics that propelled Gascón to victory played out in similar fashion in Austin, Texas, where a candidate vowing to end prosecutions of some drug sales won, and in Orlando, Florida, where voters elected Monique Worrell, whose background includes investigating claims of wrongful convictions.
In Georgia, Jackie Johnson, the Republican district attorney accused of mishandling the case of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger who was chased and shot dead by a former investigator for her office and his son, was ousted by an independent who had the support of activists outraged over the handling of the case.
“It’s telling, because it’s not just in bluer, urban locations like Los Angeles,” said Miriam Krinsky, a former federal prosecutor and executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, which advises prosecutors and candidates seeking change. “We saw a number of DAs elected in Georgia. We saw DAs in Florida elected. We saw wins of reform-minded DAs in Michigan and Texas and Colorado and Columbus, Ohio.”
As the movement builds momentum, with more progressive prosecutors taking office each election cycle, they have increasingly come together to influence policy and make significant changes in America’s criminal justice system, despite growing pushback from police unions and state officials.
In a joint statement last month, dozens of prosecutors across the country called for reducing the number of people on parole and probation. And in California, several prosecutors, including Gascon’s successor in San Francisco, Chesa Boudin, formed an alliance aimed at promoting progressive candidates and taking positions on state legislation.
Taken together, their efforts amount to a challenge to the power and money of law enforcement unions, which have typically backed traditional, tough-on-crime candidates and have been seen by critics as standing against efforts to change policing.
In Los Angeles, which was seen as the most important prize for progressive activists in a wave of victories that started with the 2016 elections of Kim Foxx in Chicago and Kimberly Gardner in St. Louis, both candidates framed the outcome of the election, at least in part, around the reconsideration of policing and racial disparities in the criminal justice system forced upon the nation when Floyd, a Black man, died under the knee of a white police officer.
Gascón’s opponent, Jackie Lacey, who is Black and was the first woman to become district attorney in Los Angeles, told reporters in announcing her concession, “It may be said that one day the results of this election is a result of our season of discontent, and a demand to see a tsunami of change.”
Gascón, a Cuban émigré who began his law enforcement career patrolling the streets of Los Angeles as a police officer, was always a viable candidate — he earned enough votes in the March primary to force a runoff with Lacey, a fellow Democrat. He pushed back on the notion that the activism around Floyd’s death was decisive in his election but acknowledged that it “altered the dynamics of this race.”
“There’s no question that the murder of George Floyd shook the conscience of this country in many corners where people were not concerned about this work before,” Gascón said in declaring victory.
Los Angeles has recently sent people to prison at a rate of four times its northern rival, San Francisco, where Gascón enacted a series of changes after becoming its district attorney in 2011. Lacey had the backing of several law enforcement unions, while Gascon benefited from the support of Black Lives Matter activists and wealthy individuals, including George Soros and Reed Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix.
All told, more than $19 million poured into their race, according to The Los Angeles Times, a record for a district attorney’s race.
Sensing the mood in the streets after the killing of Floyd, many liberal leaders in Los Angeles, including Mayor Eric M. Garcetti and Rep. Adam Schiff, pulled their endorsements of Lacey and backed Gascón. His message of reducing incarceration resonated with voters despite a surge in gun violence and homicides in Los Angeles, a similar trend seen in other U.S. cities that experts blame on the coronavirus pandemic.
Gascón’s victory came as Californians also voted down a measure, Proposition 20, that would have rolled back earlier reforms by reinstituting harsher sentences and reducing opportunities for parole, and approved a measure restoring voting rights for people convicted of felonies. And as a direct result of protests and national calls to “defund the police,” Los Angeles voters approved an initiative to shift money from jails to social services.
After taking office Monday, Gascón enacted many of his campaign promises as policy, including efforts to review thousands of old cases to determine whether the prosecutor’s office should ask courts to reduce sentences or overturn convictions. Gascón also said he would end prosecutions of most first-time, nonviolent offenders and ban his office from seeking the death penalty or enhanced prison sentences for accused gang members.
“Whether you are a protester, a police officer or a prosecutor, I ask you to walk with me,” he said after being sworn in, adding, “We can break the multigenerational cycles of violence, trauma and arrest and recidivism that has led America to incarcerate more people than any other nation.”
His sweeping policy changes met with resistance, however, from proponents of more traditional law enforcement.
“His plans will do nothing but further victimize Los Angeles residents,” the Los Angeles Police Protective League, a police union, said in a statement.
In his campaign, Gascón built a large coalition of support among Los Angeles’ diverse communities, including white voters who said they were moved by the summer protests and police shootings in the city and around the country.
“It’s policing gone too far,” said Janice Bronco, 72, who is white and lives in Lakewood, a small city in southern Los Angeles County.
She decided to vote for Gascon after seeing an increase in news reports about Black men and women killed by the police.
“I’m a supporter of the police, but so many are getting killed,” she said.
Bronco said she was concerned that Gascon had been too lenient on crime during his time as district attorney in San Francisco but voted for him anyway.
“Something’s got to change, especially in LA,” she said.

Six years later, the photo remains one of Ricardo Allen’s favorites. Standing in a Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Atlanta Falcons defensive back is smiling ear to ear, having just been promoted to the active roster after spending most of his rookie season on the practice squad. Matt Ryan, the team’s star quarterback, is walking into the frame to shake his hand.
“Now it’s time to be making some of those big checks,” Allen remembers Ryan saying, referring to the sixfold bump in pay he would receive. “And with them comes a greater level of responsibility.”
Allen, 28, cherishes the picture because it captured the elation he felt after overcoming being cut in training camp — a scene captured on the HBO reality show, “Hard Knocks” — and his unlikely relationship with Ryan, 35, that has now guided both men through this tumultuous year that has rocked them both, personally and professionally.
As two of the longest-tenured Falcons, team captains and leaders of the offense and defense, players who study the game obsessively and share notes, they have leaned on each other as the team — and its social justice committee that they lead — sought ways to respond to the social upheaval roiling the country, a journey The New York Times is following this season.
Allen and Ryan don’t finish each other’s sentences or hang out often at backyard barbecues. Rather, their friendship was forged in the training facility, where their lockers face each other’s, and it has deepened to the point that when Allen’s brother was killed this summer, Ryan was among the first people to reach out.
“There’s a level of depth that comes with time,” Ryan said of their relationship. “You just feel for the guy, your friend, and what he’s going through, losing a loved one.”
The team’s miserable start, in which the Falcons (4-7) lost their first five games and fired coach Dan Quinn and general manager Thomas Dimitroff, could change Allen and Ryan’s future as teammates, a concern that looms as the team continues social justice initiatives they’d planned as part of a wave of renewed NFL activism.
Like it or not, the losing has bled into the Falcons’ off-field activism, and the committee’s plans for 2020 were winnowed down to primarily focus on mentoring high school football players on election rights via videoconference calls. Their work resulted in students from Atlanta’s Booker T. Washington High School and Savannah’s Groves High School volunteering at polling stations during November’s general election, with plans to return for Georgia’s runoff election on Jan. 5. Personally, Allen plans to ramp up his work with Black teens in detention centers, and Ryan has raised nearly $2 million to help underprivileged youth in Atlanta.
Their efforts reflect the different paths they took to the NFL. Ryan attended private schools, was drafted third overall in 2008 and has become the face of the franchise in Atlanta. It was only after George Floyd’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police in May that Ryan felt compelled to come off the sidelines on the issue of racial inequity.
“When you haven’t gone through something yourself, it’s harder to be able to relate to it,” Ryan said to explain not getting involved earlier. “But turning a blind eye is no longer acceptable to me. It took time, and I wish I had done it faster, but we’re in a position where I hope we’re starting to move things in the right direction.”
Allen’s involvement is driven more by his lived experience. The first member of his family to attend college, the diminutive cornerback (he’s 5-foot-9) earned a roster spot off the practice squad, a kind of NFL Horatio Alger story.
Allen was raised by a single mother, Brenda Green, who worked two jobs, and an older brother, Adrian, whom he idolized. Allen didn’t play youth football because money was tight. He later joined the football team at Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he befriended Michael Squillacote, one of a handful of white teammates. Their relationship changed the trajectory of Allen’s life.
He spent weeks at a time at Squillacote’s home, which sits on 10 acres in a largely white area north of Daytona Beach, about 10 miles and a world away from where Allen lived. The two teenagers bonded over video games, talking football and working out. In return for their hospitality, Squillacote’s parents, Steve and Betsy Squillacote, expected Allen to complete the same chores as their two sons and carry at least a 3.0 grade-point average. Allen and Michael Squillacote worked at Steve Squillacote’s homebuilding company.
“He just needed a push in the right direction,” Betsy Squillacote said.
The Squillacotes’ house, he said, was something “you only saw in the movies and on TV.” He appreciated that for the first time, he had a father figure in his life. He also fended off scrutiny from his Black friends.
“I’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘Hey, man, what are you doing hanging with that family?’” Allen said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about? They helped raise me.’”
The Squillacotes’ influence helped ease Allen’s move to Purdue University, in predominantly white West Lafayette, Indiana, to play college football. But it still came as a shock to him when campus police stopped him one night on campus and asked to search his backpack for no apparent reason. Later, Allen came to feel that he had been racially profiled, an uncomfortable reminder that even his notoriety as a football player did not exempt him from being targeted because of the color of his skin.
After Allen was promoted to the active roster late in 2014, he and Ryan’s relationship blossomed. They faced each other in practice, and Ryan taught Allen how to read offenses and how to navigate the off-field responsibilities of being a professional football player. Allen, a favorite of Quinn’s, rose to being a full-time starter at safety in 2015 and founder of the team’s social justice committee in 2017.
“I’ve always had a tremendous amount of respect for him as a player, but as he’s grown into a more veteran player, his voice is heard more on different topics,” Ryan said of Allen. “He’s a confidante for me.”
During their seven years together, Allen and Ryan have obsessed over the minutiae of their sport. Before every game, Ryan stops at Allen’s locker for a pregame pep talk. After practice, they chat about parenthood in the hot or cold tub. In the offseason, the pair organizes workouts in Florida for veteran players. Only occasionally did they discuss tougher topics like race relations and police brutality.
In the past three years, though, Allen and other Black teammates began speaking out publicly against police brutality. Few white teammates joined them, including Ryan, who said he didn’t have the vocabulary to speak up and said his support “was always in the background.”
That changed for Ryan this summer when the Falcons held virtual meetings about Floyd’s killing. Hearing players, including Allen, describe instances of being racially profiled by police, Ryan recognized he could no longer sit idly by.
“For our team, it was the third or fourth time talking about the same things,” Ryan said. “If we continue to take the same approach, and guys continue to do what we’ve been doing, that’s not going to work.”
In early June, after ESPN wrote about Allen’s 2018 trip to Selma, Alabama, to visit the site of 1965 Civil Rights march, Ryan called and, in what he said was an uncomfortable conversation, asked how he should speak out because he was unfamiliar with talking about issues of race.
Allen told him just to be himself and speak from the heart.
“I’m from the ’hood and live in the country club now, but I can see how people don’t understand what it’s like in the ’hood because they’ve never seen it,” Allen said of Ryan’s discomfort.
“Matt and a bunch of other white teammates hit me up, and the main thing they tried to tell me was, they don’t know the perfect thing to say,” Allen recalled.
Ryan’s community efforts, to that point, focused on supporting children’s hospitals and Boys and Girls clubs. Growing up outside of Philadelphia, Ryan had classmates and teammates of various backgrounds. But he did not have to confront the harsh realities that Black teammates like Allen routinely did.
“I feel fortunate to come from where I come from,” Ryan said. “Playing sports my whole life, I’ve also come to appreciate it even more because knowing other situations that guys have gone through. There’s a lot of things they’ve had to overcome that I didn’t.”
Ryan joined the Falcons’ social justice committee and decided to use his popularity in Atlanta to raise more than $1.3 million, including $500,000 of his own money, to support after-school programs in underprivileged neighborhoods in Atlanta to give Black children a safe place to exercise and learn from mentors.
To drum up donations, Ryan held a radio-a-thon and invited Allen, who talked about growing up in Florida. When Ryan formed a committee to help him disperse those funds, Allen suggested including influential people in Atlanta’s Black community, including rapper Killer Mike, born Michael Render, who is one-half of the hip-hop duo Run the Jewels.
Allen has been “one of the first guys I asked to help, and he’s been one of the first guys to give advice on things going on from the jump,” Ryan said.
Then the violence that surrounded Allen growing up hit home. In late July, Adrian Allen, who was 31, was stabbed to death in a fight in Daytona Beach. Adrian Allen had been in and out of jail over the years, Ricardo Allen said, cleaning up his life for a while, then falling backward.
Ryan was one of the few Falcons told about Adrian Allen’s death, and he immediately called to offer his sympathy, something that reminded Ricardo Allen of how far they’d come as friends.
“You don’t really have very many good friends in the NFL, because players come and go, and they’re focused on their lives,” Allen said. Ryan’s call “says that I’m not just a football player to him, that he cares for me outside the walls of what we do for a business.”
