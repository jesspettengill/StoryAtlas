Full text: Just like his life, new Minnesota United striker Kei Kamara's first electoral ballot marked and submitted is well traveled.
His wife, Kristin, three young children and mother brought it with them from Denver to his new city this month. He carried it with him when all six visited the Minneapolis memorial that commemorates the life and death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in May when Kamara still played in Colorado.
"It just happened," Kamara said. "The morning we went, I just said I'm going to take my ballot with me and pay my respect because this is a man who's not going to be able to vote. It was cold, and snow was coming down. I had my ballot in my hand. I paid my tribute. I came back home and cast it in the mail. It really did feel special."
A Muslim teenage refugee who escaped Sierra Leone's long civil war in a leaky fishing boat, Kamara has been a U.S. citizen since 2006 but never voted until now.
Separated from his mother when he was 6, raised by an aunt and a multitude of cousins until he was 14, Kamara survived his West Africa country's strife without becoming a casualty or child soldier. He saw "too much for a kid" long before he found acceptance and success in a new land and new life where he has become MLS' fifth-leading all-time goal scorer.
Outspoken with what Loons coach Adrian Heath calls a "big personality," Kamara now at age 36 plays for his ninth MLS team in 14 seasons after a September trade.
"I'm just a dream walking," he said. "I never could have guessed all that can happen."
Saw too much
Kamara's mother, Fatima, won a 1990 immigration lottery and left for Los Angeles to help support the family she left behind. She sent her son to live with her sister in a house with five wives and filled with children just as Sierra Leone's civil war between its army and anti-government rebels erupted. It lasted 11 years, killed at least 50,000 people and consumed the country.
"I didn't have cousins growing up," he said. "I didn't know what that was. We were brothers and sisters."
Kamara credits older brothers for keeping the family together and keeping him safe while rebels and government soldiers alternately lived with them for weeks.
"The things he talks about, I can hardly imagine unless you're watching a movie," said Loons veteran Ethan Finlay, who played two seasons with Kamara in Columbus. "But that's how he grew up."
Rebels recruited some of his brothers, and others shot his sister Baindu in the back when she refused to join. He and other children once watched soldiers execute rebels.
"I saw too much as a kid," Kamara said. "I lived through it my whole childhood. It was in my town, in the cities. I saw everything you could see."
He still often dreams such things.
"I have these nightmares where I'm running, being chased," Kamara said. "It's always something in your dreams."
He traveled these past 22 years seeking home, from Sierra Leone to Gambia, where he wait-listed two years to join his mother in America. He arrived in Baltimore to stay first with an uncle in 2000, not long before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
"The year I came, the Twin Towers went down," Kamara said. "I came from a civil war country and a war breaks out in America. It was very, very scary. I tried to understand these things I heard about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda and I'm like, 'That's not what I was taught as a Muslim.' "
Lucky, wherever he goes
Finally reunited with his mother in Los Angeles after a decade apart, he was mocked in high school for his stutter and accent until he joined a soccer team. "They never made fun of me," he said.
He starred at Division II California State-Dominguez Hills, and Columbus Crew drafted him ninth in 2006, the same year he became a U.S. citizen.
Fourteen years later, he has scored 130 MLS goals, played in England's Premier League, married, become a father and searches still for a place to call home. Finlay calls him "matured" and changed by marriage and fatherhood this time around.
"It's a strange one, isn't it?" Loons coach Adrian Heath said about Kamara's nomadic career. "He's unique, probably one of the best headers of the ball there has been in this league. When you look 'round, scorers come at a premium. It doesn't surprise me that people have taken him."
Kamara considers his many travels a ticket to see the world. He answers "my family" when asked where home is in a career that might have the same theme as a childhood that left him a refugee without one.
"Some people are lucky staying in one place. I consider us lucky," he said. "My wife is from Kansas. We've lived in England, Vancouver, all around America. When we're done, we'll find a place to call home."
He considers his profession a ticket, too, to changing hearts and minds, from police and people who judge or profile him by his skin color or religion. A state patrol trooper stopped him for what he considered no reason on his drive with a Black friend from Denver to Minnesota after he was traded.
He said the encounter transformed when he told the white officer with a drug-sniffing dog he was a pro soccer player bound for his new team.
"Those always are my first words to ease the situation," he said. "You judge me different if you know I'm a professional athlete. Right then, everything changed. He said, 'Oh, my son plays soccer.' It just changes."
Not too late
Kamara never considered himself political, not in his youth watching Sierra Leone's often corrupt two-party tribal system that he considered "just a game," and a fixed one at that.
And not as an adult and an American when he thought his voice -- and vote -- didn't matter, until now.
Kamara said he feels "a bit of regret" he had never voted, particularly now that he has daughters ages 5 and 9 months and a 3-year-old son by whom he wants to do right.
"I'm happy I came to my senses not too late," he said. "Now I'm able to do that, exercise my rights. I have kids now. I don't want to be telling my kids that I never voted."
He considers himself better educated and committed -- a member of MLS' Black Players for Change and a father and husband -- to seek racial equality, social justice and what Kamara terms "change for a better world."
He said he is not voting for this first time solely because of the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and many others.
"Maybe if I would have voted, if how many of us who didn't vote would have, things would be different," Kamara said. "It's not that I want everybody to vote on my side. Yes, I have a side I'm voting for. But it's voting so your voice is heard. Whatever the outcome is, let us all be part of it. Whether it goes our way or doesn't go our way, I was part of it."

BareBones reinvents Halloween: Art installations take the place of its annual puppet show to mark this year of grieving.

Full text: Light snow turned into a rapid flurry Sunday afternoon at Roberts Annex, the vacant-lot-turned-artist-project where Roberts Shoes once stood in south Minneapolis. Three weeks ago, a pop-up barbershop had offered passersby COVID-safe haircuts on this corner at Lake Street and Chicago Avenue, just eight blocks from where George Floyd died.
"A grandma came by with grandkids and said, 'Can I get their hair cut?' " said actor and theater professor Harry Waters Jr. "We had all the protocols, people wiping down. People would sit and watch."
Waters is co-director this year for BareBones Productions, the Twin Cities company beloved for its annual Halloween pageants that have brought giant puppets, fire dancers and acrobatics to audiences in public parks for the past 26 years. Its current production, however, takes a radically different approach.
"We are in a triple pandemic with COVID-19, systemic racism and the election coming up," said Waters, who in May watched Lake Street burn from his apartment in Midtown Global Market.
Friday and Saturday from 5 p.m. until dark, the space will transform into a stage for Elliot Etzkorn's "Calling of the Names" project, a
modification of a regular BareBones offering. Visitors can walk up to the mic and speak the names of people they've lost.
Next to it is Gustavo Adolfo Boada Rivas' papier-mch mural "De Colores." Inspired by the anthem of the United Farm Workers movement, it depicts an overflowing rainbow, the goddess of water and fertility and naked immigrant kids in the flowing stream, inspired by the children detained at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Roberts Annex is one of more than 25 sites where visitors can encounter works by 40 artists taking part in BareBones' 2020 program, "Offerings: Artists Respond to the Mourning, Grieving and Fires on Lake Street."
You can do a choose-your-own-adventure tour using a map at BareBonesPuppets.org to navigate the locations along Lake Street and at George Floyd Memorial Square at 38th and Chicago. Some projects are already over, but others will be on view through Nov. 7, and an online retrospective will be available in mid-November.
When Waters and Leslie Brito, a Venezuelan American theater director, choreographer and educator, applied to be guest directors this year, they focused on artists from seven different communities: Black, Latinx, Somali, Native, trans, Nordic and the unhoused.
Altars from the rubble
The Roberts Annex also features "Florecemos" (Spanish for "We will bloom"), an altar-like sculpture made from bricks, rubble, carpet and burnt wood by Johanna Keller Flores and Kieran Myles-Andrs Tverbakk. Atop this offering to the community, the artists placed a written poem on waterproof paper, a miniature snake, frog and other "alebrejas," or little animal guardian figures, and fresh plants and flowers.
"I feel like it's important to have something physical to ground your grief," said Flores.
"It would be so easy to forget if the rubble wasn't still here," said Tverbakk, pointing to a giant pile of debris across the street where a Foot Locker and other stores once stood. "This stuff has really traumatized the people in this neighborhood."
Brito and Waters started planning this event in June, walking Lake Street with a group of BareBones artists every Sunday afternoon.
"We live here," said Brito. "We were embedded in what happened during the uprising. … Having those ongoing experiences of Lake Street inform people's art-making. It's embodied because you are paying attention to how your body feels when you are walking."
At the east end of Lake, just blocks from the Mississippi River, BakiBakiBaki Z Porter and Chaim Budenosky installed an altar made of two repurposed cabinets covered in mirrors and lace inside the garage of R.A.R.E. Productions, a support organization for BIPOC queer and trans artists. They'll activate the piece Friday from 3 to 6 p.m., with likely late-night hours on Saturday.
The piece is intended to help people grieve, and create a spiritual portal to their ancestors. "People have had to grieve a lot through Zoom, and it's like -- you can see yourself in that little box, but you can't connect really well," said Porter, who is Black, Native and nonbinary.
But the space will also have lights, reflections and the celebratory feel of a queer club.
"When people come in, I want them to be confused [and] think, 'Wait, is this a party?' " said Porter. "This year has been one of the deadliest for Black trans people in particular. The threat of death is ever-present but our love is everlasting, and that's what we are trying to get at."

'White boys' flap missed the point

Full text: Minneapolis Police Deputy Chief Art Knight gave half a quote to the paper the other week.
He was talking about a defunct diversity program that used to encourage minority applicants to put their law enforcement degrees to good use, here in the city that killed George Floyd.
This is a town where an officer felt comfortable kneeling on a Black man's neck for more than 9 minutes while onlookers cried out for mercy. If something doesn't change about the way Minneapolis recruits, trains and promotes its police, Knight said, "you're just going to get the same old white boys."
That didn't go over well with the white boys.
The Minneapolis Police Federation called for a "thorough investigation into the racially charged comments." This is same Police Federation that could not understand why north Minneapolis neighbors got so upset over the Christmas tree in the Fourth Precinct lobby. The one the officers decorated with crime scene tape, menthol cigarettes and garbage.
Nothing Knight said was racist and nothing he said was inaccurate. This is a nation built on root-deep racism, where white boys are still the default assumption for roles in society from police officer to president.
Anyone can be cruel, prejudiced, ignorant, or overly glib in a newspaper quote. But Knight was making an important point about an uncomfortable topic. That point got lost in the uproar that followed. The death of George Floyd could have started a discussion about how it feels to be policed in Minneapolis. How it feels to be afraid of the people who are sworn to protect you.
"You don't know how we do [expletive] in Minneapolis."
Those were the words an off-duty Ramsey County sheriff's officer said he heard from a Minneapolis police officer who pulled a gun on him and roughed him up during an encounter downtown last year. The Ramsey County officer, Andrew Johnson, filed suit against the city in federal court this week.
It could have been the start of a discussion about how it feels to police Minneapolis. To be the one people call in the worst moments of their lives, when shots ring out, when someone who should love you hurts you instead, when a child goes missing, when you spot something in the river that might be a body. How it felt to be in the Third Precinct, texting final farewells home just in case, right before everything burned.
Or you could admit nothing, deny everything and counterattack.
In Ramsey County, three police unions have filed complaints against the sheriff's spokesman, because he endorsed House DFL candidate John Thompson, who made headlines months later at a protest outside the home of police union President Bob Kroll, where the crowd smashed pi±ata effigies of both Kroll and his wife.
Faced with the furious backlash in the ranks last week, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo demoted Knight from his role as chief of staff.
What everyone might want to do right now, is step away from the keyboards.
Ronal Serpas has led police departments from Nashville to New Orleans to the Washington State Patrol. After working for years between clashing mayors and city councils and their police unions, he teaches in the criminology department at Loyola University New Orleans.
"Sometimes you would hope that everyone involved could just take a deep breath," Serpas said by e-mail. "Unions are often criticized for defending what's perceived as the indefensible of their members' actions. Chiefs are often critiqued for their decisions as well. Calm reflection in both instances would advance the best in all of us."
Then, maybe, it will be time for some of those uncomfortable conversations.

Mpls. teen to receive PEN award for video of George Floyd under Chauvin's knee: Darnella Frazier will join past honoree Anita Hill.

Full text: A leading literary and human rights organization said Tuesday that it is bestowing its annual Courage Award to the Minneapolis teenager whose video of George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police was viewed by millions and inspired global outrage.
Darnella Frazier will receive the Benenson Courage Award from PEN America during a virtual gala celebration on Dec. 8.
"With nothing more than a cellphone and sheer guts, Darnella changed the course of history in this country, sparking a bold movement demanding an end to systemic anti-Black racism and violence at the hands of police," PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel said in a statement announcing Frazier's selection.
"With remarkable steadiness, Darnella carried out the expressive act of bearing witness, and allowing hundreds of millions around the world to see what she saw," Nossel added. "Without Darnella's presence of mind and readiness to risk her own safety and well-being, we may never have known the truth about George Floyd's murder."
Frazier is "humbled to receive this award and very grateful," said Kelley Bass Jackson, a public relations specialist who is assisting the teen's family in navigating her unintended presence in the public spotlight. "And she's grateful for PEN America for thinking of her."
On May 25, the 17-year-old Frazier documented the arrest of Floyd, who fell into unconsciousness as now-fired police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for roughly nine minutes. Floyd was later pronounced dead.
The video quickly spread across social media and led to protests around the world. Chauvin, who is white, and three other fired officers are awaiting trial on various murder and manslaughter charges in connection with the Black man's death.
Frazier has yet to speak publicly about her role in telling the story of Floyd's death beyond what she told the Star Tribune the next day. "The world needed to see what I was seeing," she said. "Stuff like this happens in silence too many times."
In June, attorney Seth Cobin spoke for Frazier and said she wasn't looking to be a hero but is "just a 17-year-old high school student, with a boyfriend and a job at the mall, who did the right thing. She's the Rosa Parks of her generation."
The New York-based PEN America announced late last month that former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was forced out of her job last year by the Trump administration, will join Frazier in receiving the Benenson Courage Award.
Yovanovitch was recalled from Kiev as unofficial Trump envoy Rudy Giuliani pressed Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless corruption allegations against 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Prior Courage Award honorees include Anita Hill, who testified during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas, who now sits on the Supreme Court; student gun violence activists from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Cameron Kasky, Samantha Fuentes, and Zion Kelly; the Women's March; Flint, Mich., contaminated water whistleblowers LeeAnne Walters and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha; and the surviving staff of the French publication Charlie Hebdo, honored in the wake of the killings of 12 of their colleagues.
The 2020 PEN America Gala is being held virtually this year as the world copes with the deadly coronavirus pandemic.
Others being honored by PEN in December include the author and musician Patti Smith and Chinese dissident Xu Zhiyong.

After all, as of last weekend, all of the nearly 700 soldiers from the Minnesota National Guard's St. Paul-based 34th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade will have returned home safely from a yearlong deployment scattered throughout the Middle East in support of Operation Spartan Shield and Operation Inherent Resolve.
But Kennedy's past year has had so many low points. Was it when Iranian missiles in January rocketed into American military bases in Iraq that housed fellow Minnesota soldiers?
Was it when, as America shut down due to a terrifying virus, she worried how her five children would weather a global pandemic without mom? Or when rockets struck Camp Taji in Iraq, killing two American service members, including a California soldier serving under Kennedy's brigade?
Was the low point when, on Memorial Day and just blocks from where Kennedy used to live, a white Minneapolis police officer killed a Black man and ignited a national uprising?
If Kennedy, a single mom of five who range in age from 28 to 3, had to pick one low moment from her yearlong deployment, though, it probably came in June, a couple of weeks after George Floyd's death.
She got two calls from home. One was her next-door neighbor, whose son was a Minneapolis police officer. The neighbor was crying; she feared for her son's safety. The other was Kennedy's own son. The 10-year-old was crying, too. It was as if racial lines were being drawn among friends he'd had since preschool. "What's wrong with my skin?" he asked his mom, half a world away at Camp Buehring, the American military base in Kuwait.
In her office, where she was in charge of administrative duties such as payroll, Kennedy broke down. With a goal to become the first Black female sergeant major in the Minnesota National Guard, she felt she needed at least one overseas deployment on her rsum.
"But if I would have known it would be so chaotic at home when I deployed," she said, "I never would have done it."
In normal circumstances, military homecomings are large, emotional events full of pomp and circumstance. Instead, this month's homecomings for the 34th have been scattered, sedated affairs -- intimate family reunions at the airport, packed with emotions but tinged with the reality that they are returning to a state and a nation completely changed from when they left.
A worldwide pandemic has struck the United States harder than any other country. An economy is devastated. A national reckoning on race began with George Floyd's killing in these soldiers' home state. Scars remain in the Twin Cities from the unrest of the aftermath, when fellow Guard members were activated to quell the violence. And the political landscape days before a general election feels more divisive than ever.
After a more chaotic deployment than anyone expected, it is this new and different world to which these Minnesotans return.
"The focus now is the reintegration of our soldiers," said Col. Gregory Fix, the brigade commander. "They've all lived with the stress of combat, and now coming back to COVID-19, everything is a little different."
This was supposed to be a routine deployment. The situation in the Middle East was relatively stable. The 700 Minnesotans were part of a brigade of about 2,000 service members. If a threat emerged -- as it would during their deployment, with the reemergence of local militias attacking U.S. troops -- Fix would tell concerned parents, "When we go places, we go to win."
Fix's brigade had just landed in the Middle East when, days after Christmas, the situation changed. An Iraqi militia killed an American contractor in a rocket attack. In retaliation, the U.S. killed 25 militiamen in airstrikes. That led to an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Helicopters from the 34th helped evacuate hundreds of coalition military personnel from the embassy. Then a U.S. drone strike killed major general Qassem Soleimani, one of the most powerful people in Iran, followed by Iran's tactical ballistic missile strikes at Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers. About 100 members of the brigade suffered traumatic brain injuries such as concussions, though nobody died. Of those injuries, 14 were to Minnesotans.
"These things all happened really rapidly," Fix said. "But it was inspiring how our soldiers just kept going. They never abandoned the mission."
Floyd's killing and its aftermath hit the Minnesota soldiers hard. Fix did one-on-one videoconferences with his soldiers to gauge their emotions. The brigade did town halls for soldiers. But it was tough, because of COVID restrictions and because the brigade was so dispersed.
"Our deployment was a unique deployment," said Kennedy. "I don't think anyone's ever quite experienced what we experienced."
After two weeks quarantined at Fort Hood, Texas, earlier in October, Kennedy hopped in the 2014 Infiniti QX60 she bought after the deployment and drove 16 hours home. She told her children she wouldn't be home until November, so when Kennedy, dressed in fatigues, walked into Mini-Hops Gymnastics in Plymouth, where her oldest daughter, Rayesha, works as a dance coach, it was quite the surprise. Rayesha kept touching her mom's face, as if uncertain she was real.
Little by little, Rayesha, 28 years old and a surrogate parent for her younger siblings the past year, has revealed bits of the past year's trauma that she'd hidden while Mom was deployed. Like when the kids packed go-bags in the middle of the riots, just in case. Or when they filled the bathtub with water, fearful a white supremacist might burn the house down.
Life back home is -- well, it's weird. Kennedy forgets to wear masks sometimes. She has yet to go grocery shopping. She took her aunt to dinner at Benihana in St. Louis Park; it felt strange but safe. She is still adjusting to 10-year-old Rayshawn and 14-year-old Ahkirrah doing virtual school. She's taking online classes herself, studying for her master's degree in executive leadership.
But she hasn't visited the site of Floyd's killing. She wants to. It feels important. But not yet.
"I don't think I'm ready to embrace that part of being home just yet," said Kennedy, who works full-time for the Guard as an equal employment opportunity specialist focused on diversity and inclusion. "I know it's there, but I'm just taking it slow. I don't want to be overwhelmed by anything."
She always knew she'd have to have The Talk with her son, when she discussed the challenges of being a Black man in America. She never imagined it would be when he was 10, when she was half a world away, when nationwide protests started blocks from where she was living when she was his age. Now, she sees someone different from the boy she left a year ago. He's still a kid at heart -- still fascinated by Legos and LeBron James and learning about constellations -- but a maturity has risen in him.
"He's asking grown-man questions," Kennedy said. "That's really the biggest change for me. That's not my little baby boy talking. This is a young Black man talking."

RESOURCE FAIR MOVES ONLINE
An event this week that aims to connect hundreds of area veterans to service providers is moving online due to the coronavirus pandemic.
On Thursday, the Minnesota Military and Veteran Exchange is partnering with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for Experience 2020, a virtual military and veteran resource and benefits event.
The free event from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. will connect veterans with dozens of service providers, federal and state government agencies, veteran service organizations, hiring officials and housing agencies.
Gov. Tim Walz will give opening remarks.
"When a man or woman ends their military commitment as a uniformed service member, they may not immediately realize that their journey as a veteran is just beginning," said Allison Alstrin, project manager for Minnesota Military and Veteran Exchange. "Our E2020 event is focused on connecting Minnesota's military-connected citizens with the resources they have earned."

FOR BLACK VOTERS, EQUALITY IS ON BALLOT: NATIONAL DISCOURSE ON RACE IS ECHOING IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Full text: Placards urging visitors to vote surround George Floyd Square, a reminder that the nationwide racial reckoning that emanated from this south Minneapolis intersection in May has reverberated through this year's election.
Black voters in South Carolina helped propel Joe Biden to the Democratic presidential nomination, and polls show that former President Barack Obama's vice president is overwhelmingly favored by African Americans nationwide over President Donald Trump.
But while many Black activists see a president who is running with the backing of self-styled white supremacist groups, some younger activists holding vigils at Chicago Avenue and 38th Street remain unconvinced that the outcome of the presidential contest will help achieve the racial equality they seek.
"I know we fought for our right to vote, but if we're given two clowns to vote for, that's not really giving us a choice, it's a Catch-22," said Andrew Jackson, who was part of a group that was helping to winterize the memorial the day after a record October snowfall.
Jackson said he would never vote for Trump, whom he views as a white supremacist. But Biden hasn't won his support, either; Jackson said he won't check a box in the presidential race. Like many of the activists at the site where Minneapolis police officers killed Floyd on May 25, Jackson said he's more focused on local elections.
He illustrates the challenge facing Biden and Democrats as they push to hold Minnesota against a concerted effort by Trump to turn the state red in a presidential election for the first time since 1972.
Trump nearly won Minnesota in 2016, an election that saw turnout by Black voters fall significantly in Minnesota and other states that were previously reliable for Democrats in presidential elections. For decades a vital part of the Democratic coalition, Black voters turned out in lower numbers in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- contributing to Hillary Clinton's losses in the battleground states that helped install Trump in the White House.
Minnesota's Black population is smaller compared with the total population of those three states, but a similar drop in turnout was a likely factor in Clinton's close call in Minnesota, which retains the longest unbroken string of backing Democrats for president.
A Star Tribune analysis of voting patterns in Minnesota precincts with a majority or plurality of Black voters shows a drop in registered voter turnout from 75% in 2012 to 70% in 2016. At the same time, statewide registered voter turnout hovered around 82% in both of those elections.
The analysis draws from 32 precincts in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Brooklyn Park and Brooklyn Center where census figures show Black residents either comprise over half the population, are the largest racial or ethnic group, or are about tied for the largest group.
Facing the possibility of another close election, the Biden campaign's organizing efforts in Minnesota, like in other battleground states, is focused on turning out Black voters. Any uptick in votes from those precincts, all reliably Democratic, would be a solid insurance policy to offset Trump's efforts to boost turnout in the vast rural regions where he's shown lopsided support.
"I've been really proud of this campaign for saying this is a community that we're going to make sure we give its proper attention, the proper resourcing, and do everything we can to get that vote out," said Corey Day, the Biden campaign's senior adviser for Minnesota. "These are voters that can make a big difference on our margins in this state."
In Minnesota, the Biden campaign has several staff members responsible for getting out the Black vote: an African American community engagement director, two organizers focused on the Black community, and a coordinator that works with Black churches and faith groups. They've targeted phone banks, community meetings, virtual events, and voter education and registration drives at Black beauty salons and barber shops.
The Trump campaign also has a strategy to make inroads with Black voters. The riots and destruction that followed Floyd's killing in Minneapolis quickly became the impetus for a "law and order" message that Trump has led with for much of the campaign. Vice President Mike Pence made a surprise visit to north Minneapolis in September as part of a Midwest tour to highlight what Republicans say is growing lawlessness in Democratic-controlled cities. There he met with Flora Westbrooks, a Black woman whose salon burned down in the riots in May.
"We see inroads we can make with community members due to things that have transpired," said Paris Dennard, senior adviser to the Republican National Committee on Black community affairs. "It resonates with you if you feel like you can't walk outside, your child can't walk outside in your neighborhood without getting shot, if you're a Black business owner worried that your building is going to burn."
Dennard said the Trump campaign has established field offices in some states aimed at engaging Black voters for Trump, but that Minnesota is not one of them.
Brian Herron, a former Minneapolis City Council member and the pastor at Zion Baptist Church on the city's North Side, said he's seen evidence of the Biden campaign's organizing efforts though he'd like to see more. But he said any efforts he's seen from the Trump campaign are "disingenuous at best."
Last week, some North Side residents reported receiving food boxes that were part of a coronavirus assistance program, complete with a letter from the White House signed by Trump. "I hope people aren't fooled by that," Herron said.
Under any scenario, winning large numbers of Black voters is an uphill battle for the president: An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in September found Biden leading Trump among Black Americans 90 to 5%.
Still, it's not impossible to find Black Trump supporters in Minnesota. "I am real with someone exposing our government for what they are," said Victor Gaten, a 31-year-old who cast his ballot for Trump last week at an early voting site in Minneapolis.
Walter Hudson, an Albertville City Council member, considered himself a "Never Trump" Republican in 2016 but said he's since come around to the president. "Nasty thoughts don't harm me," Hudson said. "I'm less concerned with whether or not Donald Trump is racist than whether his policies are racially discriminatory, and I've seen no evidence of that."
Polling has suggested that Biden's two terms as vice president under Obama and his selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate have left him in good standing with many Black voters.
"I figure he might be on that same platform, to get everything back to where it was," said Antoine Thornton, 54, who was also voting early last week. Thornton particularly cited Trump's handling of the pandemic and his treatment of women.
Some prominent Black leaders in Minnesota -- even those uncomfortable with past positions of both Biden and Harris on issues of criminal justice and mass incarceration -- say they still feel powerfully compelled to vote for the Democratic ticket.
"I'm biting the bullet and voting for Biden and Harris," said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer and activist. "Any harm they're responsible for pales in comparison to the actions of Donald Trump and the havoc he'd wreak on our society if he gets another four years."
Angela Myers, the second vice president of the Minneapolis branch of the NAACP, said she thinks the 77-year-old Biden is particularly well situated to win over older Black voters. That demographic helped carry him to victory in the Democratic primaries earlier this year, even as younger Black voters gravitated toward candidates like Harris and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
"For the young folks, I think they're ready to vote for Joe," said Myers, who's 25 and is running unopposed for the local NAACP presidency. "I think it's kind of just like, 'Of course, this is who we got?' "
Younger Black voters also seem likely to be the most animated by the wave of activism that followed Floyd's death and the Black Lives Matter movement. Biden has promised to get behind stronger police accountability measures at the federal level, though he has not joined activists' calls to defund police departments.
At the Floyd memorial site last week, some questioned whether their cause was actually any better served with Democrats in charge.
"George Floyd was killed with a Democratic governor, with a Democratic mayor and with a seemingly Democratic City Council," said Toussaint Morrison, a community organizer. "Black liberation and anti-white supremacy are not on the ballot, unfortunately."
Marcia Howard, a 47-year-old English teacher, had been standing watch at the snowy intersection for nearly 12 hours. She said she understands too well why so many in her community are disenchanted with voting. Democrats and Republicans alike have failed Black people, she said.
As she left the memorial, Howard said she was headed to an early voting site.
"I vote because people did what we're doing at George Floyd Square for our right to vote," Howard said. "However flawed that process is, the moment that they convince us that we shouldn't do it, they're winning."

IN GRIEF, A PLEA TO THE POLICE: FAMILIES OF SLAIN, UNITED BY TRAGEDY, PUSH FOR CHANGE

Full text: They are always wary of who might be listening, so the families met in a remote park pavilion 13 miles outside Minneapolis, where they could spread out among some picnic tables, pass around chips and bottles of water and talk openly.
It had been an exhausting summer, spent telling stories of their darkest moments to strangers on some legislative committee, or to a legion of activists gathered in Minneapolis' dog-day humidity, or outside police precincts. A couple of them had gone hoarse from telling the stories so many times.
Even so, at this private gathering on a late-summer afternoon, they began as they always do, by telling them again.
Each starts differently --
A young autistic man is living with his grandparents. He is close to graduation from culinary arts school. One day, after getting a wrong order at a Wendy's, he loses his temper ...
A man says he wants to die. His girlfriend is afraid he might take his own life, so she calls for help ...
An inmate complains of chest pains. He says he's having difficulty moving his limbs …
-- but they all end the same way: with a loved one dying in an encounter with law enforcement officers.
"They shot him in the head," said Amity Dimock, the mother of Kobe Dimock-Heisler, a 21-year-old on the autism spectrum who was killed by police last year. "They did it in front of his grandmother. They then let his body lay there so long that he couldn't even donate organs."
Since the police killing of George Floyd, this group, known in activist circles as "the families," has emerged as an influential voice in the movement to remake policing in Minnesota. There are about 20 of them in total, spanning three generations, men and women, of different races, religions and geographic backgrounds.
They function as part grief therapy group, part lobbyists. They meet in parks like this, or on Zoom, every week, often with politicians or anyone else who might be able to help their cause -- which is to upend a system they say prevents them from attaining justice.
Over the past two decades in Minnesota, at least 195 people have died in incidents involving law enforcement, according to a Star Tribune analysis. Only one officer has been convicted of an on-duty killing in the state's history -- and, as the families frequently point out, that officer was Somali American and the victim was a white woman.
The families have already succeeded in catalyzing some systemic changes to Minnesota policing. This summer, their stories helped persuade skeptical Republican leaders to compromise on new laws that include autism and mental health training for law enforcement, a prohibition on warrior-style training and the creation of a new advisory board to investigate incidents of deadly force.
Yet, according to the families, all of these changes fall woefully short of the reckoning that is necessary.
"Hundreds of families are out here suffering in the state of Minnesota alone, and thousands around the United States," said Toshira Garraway, the founder of the families.
"The rioting happened not because of one life," she said. "People finally had enough."
No charges
Ding …
In early August, a week after the meeting in the park, Dimock awoke to the sound of a text message. It was early, not quite time to rise for work, so she ignored it, rolled back over to sleep a little longer with her Chihuahua, Lettie.
Ding … Ding … Ding …
More messages poured in. She knew something had happened. She answered a call from Jason Heisler, her ex-husband and Kobe's father. As she listened to his news, she noticed she was not mad, not sad -- not really anything.
She walked into the living room and relayed the message to Encarnacion Garcia, her partner of 20 years, who was on the couch watching television.
"They're not charging," she said.
Garcia, who was both mad and sad, uttered an expletive. "What are we going to do?" he asked.
Dimock is a wiry 47-year-old with short black hair and a bright smile. Fifteen years ago, she broke her back as the passenger in a car wreck that doctors said would leave her permanently paralyzed. Dimock regained her leg function, though she still walks with a limp and she sometimes uses a cane, the latter mostly serving as a warning to give her space in crowds. She lives in Baxter, Minn., a rural town in a conservative part of the state, in a house on a lake with an American flag glimmering in the front yard, where she is among the less than 1% of residents who are Black.
Dimock is a self-professed introvert. Even before the pandemic, she left her 8-acre property as infrequently as possible. She never pictured herself speaking at protest rallies or on TV news or fielding personal calls from the governor.
By the time she got the call that Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman's office would not file charges, it had been 11 months and five days since two Brooklyn Center police officers killed her son.
Kobe had lost his temper at Wendy's and his grandfather, Erwin, left him to walk the six blocks home. Erwin thought the walk would cool him off, but instead it had the opposite effect. Kobe stormed into the house and grabbed a paring knife and a hammer and demanded an apology.
Kobe had recently lost his health insurance, leading him to go off his medication and quit a treatment program. He had never hurt his grandparents before, but earlier that year, during a similar episode, he'd cut himself with a kitchen knife and been committed to the hospital on a psychiatric hold. Erwin feared Kobe may hurt himself again and called 911.
In interviews with investigators later, Erwin said Kobe's demeanor changed abruptly when he found out the police were coming. "He was just crying. He was so upset that the police were going to come, take him away and commit him." Erwin took the weapons from Kobe and called back 911 to tell them to "just forget it." The officers arrived anyway. Erwin asked them not to come inside the house, but they insisted on making sure everyone was OK. Police body camera footage shows Kobe seated in the living room, holding his head in his hands and sobbing as the officers questioned him. Then, suddenly, he lunged for something hidden in the couch cushions.
"He's got a knife!" screamed one of the officers.
And then they shot him six times.
For a long time afterward, Dimock thought the officers would be held criminally liable for shooting her son. When months passed, and summer turned to winter and then spring, she thought maybe Freeman's office was
just taking time to build a rock-solid case.
Then George Floyd died. Watching the national news, she saw celebrities, reporters, presidential candidates -- everyone -- speaking Floyd's name.
"Why aren't you saying 'Kobe Heisler'?" she wondered. "Why is my son's name not in your mouth also?"
After that, Dimock and Garcia started driving down to Minneapolis for protests. There, they met the other families whose stories were similar to her own. Like Dimock, they too had waited for justice that never came.
When Freeman made the official announcement not to charge, if she felt anything at all, it was a relief to have that part over with. At least now she could take the next steps, like pursuing a lawsuit.
Dimock decided to hold a news conference that day outside the government center in Minneapolis, where Freeman's office is located, to call for an independent prosecutor to review the case. She cried for the first time just after 3 p.m., standing in front of hundreds of people, including the other families and a dozen TV cameras.
That night, before driving back to Baxter, Dimock attended another protest. It was a small but vigorous crowd. Instead of shouting "shut it down," they were screaming "burn it down." At one point, a squad car drove by and the protesters swarmed it, yelling expletives at the officers inside.
This wasn't Dimock's style. She and Garcia have law enforcement in their families, and she knows police are not all bad people. But that night she found herself flipping the middle finger to the police officers.
"Get a different job!" she shouted. "What's wrong with you?!"
Marking time missed
In the world of the families, birthdays and death anniversaries are sacred, so they held a rally across the street from the Fourth Precinct, the north Minneapolis police headquarters, on the day Travis Jordan would have turned 38 years old.
Police shot and killed Jordan in November 2018. His girlfriend had called for a wellness check, afraid he might follow through on a threat to hurt himself. When the officers arrived, Jordan was holding a knife. He walked toward them, screaming, "Let's do this!" The whole thing took less than two minutes.
Freeman said that Jordan presented a serious threat, and the officers were justified in using deadly force. Yet Jordan's friends and family say it could have gone differently, that someone could have talked him down, that the officers could have kept a barrier between them and Jordan so they didn't need to shoot.
"Travis had one bad day," said Paul Johnson, Jordan's best friend and roommate. "He could have easily recovered from that bad day. Easily."
Now, nearly two years later, outside the police precinct where the officers who shot him work, the crowd sang "Happy Birthday" to Jordan. Then the families spoke.
Youa Vang Lee told of how a police officer from this same precinct shot her son, Fong Lee, on a playground 14 years ago. "He was out playing sports when the police approached him and killed him," she said through a translator.
The officer who shot him eight times, Jason Andersen, said Lee had been carrying a gun. Lee's family argued the gun was planted and had been in a police evidence locker for two years. A federal jury ruled that Andersen used reasonable force, and after the police chief fired him, Andersen fought the discharge through arbitration and won his job back with back pay. He was also charged criminally and fired for kicking a teenager in the head; in 2010, a jury found him not guilty and he again got his job back. He still works for the Minneapolis Police Department.
The families stories vary greatly in key details, such as whether their loved one carried a weapon, or if the incident was caught on film. Many begin with a person in the middle of a mental health crisis, which is why the families believe more 911 calls should be handled by social workers instead of armed police officers.
ChaMee Vue is among those who don't know what happened during their family members' final moments. She connected with the families in hopes they could help her find answers. Her father, Chiasher Fong Vue, was killed last December by Minneapolis police, and Vue said her family still hasn't been allowed to view the body-camera footage.
"My dad was shot at by more than 100 bullets," she said outside the Jordan rally. "He was killed by 13 bullets."
Many of the families talk about how the system makes it difficult to find answers after these tragic encounters. Dimock was not permitted to see bodycam footage of Kobe's death until the week Floyd died -- nine months later -- when the Brooklyn Center mayor invited her to come to his office and watch it, she presumes in hopes of stopping riots from spreading to his city.
Dimock has asked legislators to pursue a new law that would require police to show blood relatives bodycam video within 48 hours of the death. The families also want to end qualified immunity, the legal principle that protects police from being sued if they're acting within their duties. They want to set up a system that allows them to seek reparations, and to eliminate the statute of limitations that stops some families from getting justice in civil courts years later. And they want to pressure prosecutors to more aggressively pursue charges against law enforcement officers who use deadly force or otherwise cause the death of a person in their custody.
Del Shea Perry, also present at the Jordan rally, spent two years calling for an investigation into how her son, Hardel Sherrell, died in Beltrami County jail. This summer, Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell joined her in demanding an investigation, after jail employees discovered two misfiled letters written by medical staff shortly after his death. In Sherrell's final days, the letters state, guards neglected his complaints about his diminishing condition and "spoke negatively" of him, including accusing him of faking the paralysis that had spread throughout his body. The letters state the guards left Sherrell in his cell in soiled clothes and a diaper, which they refused to change, before he died of an undiagnosed immune disorder on Sept. 2, 2018.
A few weeks after the Jordan rally, in late August, some of the families marched through Minneapolis with Mia Montgomery, whose father, Lionel Lewis, died in Hibbing after police arrested him in 2002. Lewis' death certificate lists the cause as "agitated delirium" -- a controversial diagnosis that often entails profuse sweating, aggressive behavior and hyperthermia -- and cocaine use. The day of the march, it was Montgomery's birthday, and hundreds of people showed up to walk with her to Father Hennepin Bluff Park, where they grilled dinner and held a memorial for her dad.
Across the river, a crowd gathered around Nicollet Mall, where some said a police officer had killed a man. The crowd did not believe the police, who said the man had killed himself. By the time police released a video showing the death was actually a suicide, it was too late. By nightfall, rioters were breaking windows and looting shops downtown.
All over the country, from New York City to Los Angeles, similar protests and riots were unfolding over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man in Kenosha, Wis.
'I just miss him so much'
On Aug. 31, exactly one year after her son's death, Dimock stood in front of a crowd of about 200 people outside Hennepin County Government Center in downtown Minneapolis, alongside five other women who have lost family members to law enforcement encounters.
The plan had been to march through downtown. But after the riots the week before, which Dimock did not want to see repeated, she asked the others to limit the event to a candlelight vigil.
The last few months have taken a toll on Dimock. She will continue to work behind the scenes to promote change. She may move to Minneapolis and run for office. She is considering turning her Baxter property into a retreat center for families who have lost people to police violence. But she's decided her time driving down to Minneapolis, often several times a week and requiring her to miss work, must come to an end.
When it was her time to speak, she found the words stuck in her throat, making her choke up. She leaned on her cane for support as she tried to force them out. "The last time I saw my beautiful boy, he was lying in the morgue. He was still hard from the ice. And cold and clammy. I'm still upset I didn't take the wisp of hair that I saw -- I wish I had it. I just want to see my boy again. I just miss him so much."
As she climbed in the car afterward, five deputies in tan uniforms rushed outside the Government Center, lined up across the street, and stared at her car. One of them placed a hand on his belt, near where his gun was holstered.
"Hey, we're going to get pulled over, man," said Garcia as he drove off. "I see him radioing."
"Oh my God. Oh my God," said Dimock. "I do not like this."
Garcia drove steadily, careful not to stray above the speed limit, his eyes darting at the rear view mirror, until they arrived safely at the corner of Park Avenue and S. 37th Street.
Just a few blocks from where Floyd died, there is a cemetery that runs about half the length of a football field, with the words "Say their names" written on a hill. The headstones hold names like Travis Jordan, Hardel Sherrell, Justin Teigen, Philando Castile, Thurman Blevins, Jamar Clark, Brian Quinones, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. No one is actually buried here, and the headstones are made of flimsy cardboard. But for Dimock, this guerrilla art installation has become a holy place.
"Look at all these people," said Dimock, walking through the memorial. "Isn't this sad?"
She arrived at the headstone that said Kobe Heisler. It was decorated with photographs. The date of his death is wrong. But since Kobe's ashes sit on a table in her kitchen, it's the closest thing she has to a grave site.
"When I see this, I just see that he was clearly loved," said Dimock.
Dimock, Garcia and a few family members cleaned up the headstone and rearranged the offerings, placing roses they brought from the vigil. They sat around the headstone and smoked cigarettes and talked until darkness shrouded the cemetery.
"It's getting dark," Garcia called to her. "I don't like being out here after dark."
Dimock lit one more cigarette and stuck around just a little longer.

Full text: A judge on Thursday dashed the hopes of four former Minneapolis police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill dropped a lower-level murder charge against the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into George Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, but kept a higher-level murder count against him. Cahill also ruled that there was enough evidence for jurors to decide whether three other former officers should be convicted of aiding and abetting charges.
The judge dismissed a third-degree murder count against Derek Chauvin but ruled that he will remain charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter.
The development prompted Gov. Tim Walz to issue an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard to provide "public safety services and security assistance" if needed.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey requested support from the Guard "out of an abundance of caution and for the sake of preparedness," spokesman Mychal Vlatkovich said.
Civil unrest following Floyd's May 25 death led to arson and vandalism costing many millions of dollars.
Cahill dismissed the third-degree murder charge because the law applies when someone causes the death of another person while committing an act inherently dangerous to others. No one else was put at risk in the Floyd case, so the charge must be dismissed, he ruled, citing Minnesota
Supreme Court precedents.
A Minnesota Supreme Court decision in a 2014 New Brighton murder case stated that third-degree murder " 'cannot occur where the defendant's actions were focused on a specific person,' " Cahill wrote.
The third-degree murder count was seen by many in the legal community as "defective" when Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman charged it on May 29.
It cost Freeman control of the case.
Some believed that second-degree murder should have been charged instead, and took their concerns to Walz.
"It was an inappropriate charge from the get-go, and it raised a lot of concerns for us as a community law firm," said Sarah Davis, executive director of the Legal Rights Center (LRC). "It really points to what the community has been saying all along about this prosecution, which is that it truly needs to be truly independent from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office."
Michael Friedman, who was the executive director of LRC at the time, said the LRC raised the issue with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Minnesota.
The ACLU dispatched an "emergency communication" to the governor. The next day Walz appointed Attorney General Keith Ellison as lead prosecutor in the case.
A few days later on June 3, Ellison's office charged Chauvin with second-degree murder.
"The ACLU-MN argued that more severe charges were necessary to seek justice for George Floyd, and that the way the law is written the third-degree charge wasn't likely to stand," ACLU-MN Executive Director John Gordon said in a written statement. "Today was a good day for achieving justice for George Floyd."
Gordon said in an interview that Cahill's decision was not a setback, but rather a step toward "clearing away some of the underbrush" so the accurate, more serious charge could be pursued at trial.
Freeman issued a written statement noting that his office was involved in charging the higher count.
"Our office did file second-degree murder charges against Chauvin," said a statement from his office. It notes that the complaint carries the signatures of both Ellison and Freeman.
Third-degree murder is an uncommon count that some defense attorneys have said didn't suit the Floyd case. The charge best fits a situation such as someone shooting randomly into a moving train and killing someone, some have said.
The legal definition of the charge states that it applies when someone causes a death while perpetrating an act "eminently dangerous to others" and while "evincing a depraved mind," a standard that can be difficult for attorneys and judges to explain to jurors.
Freeman's office initially filed the charge and a manslaughter count against Chauvin four days after Floyd was killed.
Don Lewis, who served as a special prosecutor in the Ramsey County case against Jeronimo Yanez, the former St. Anthony police officer who was acquitted in the death of Philando Castile in 2016, has said that the third-degree murder count was viewed by many as "defective" in the Floyd case.
"I'm still somewhat perplexed by the way it was charged," Lewis said several months ago.
Similar questions about third-degree murder also arose when Freeman's office tried former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in 2019 for fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond. But prosecutors noted at trial that Noor fired his gun across his partner's body and out a squad car window toward occupied homes while a teenager was bicycling nearby.
Jurors convicted Noor of the count along with second-degree manslaughter. They acquitted him of second-degree murder.
Lewis hypothesized that Freeman charged Chauvin with third-degree murder because he was "comfortable" with it given the outcome at Noor's trial.
Cahill's rulings resolved issues that had some activists worried that Floyd's death would go unheard in the court system like many previous cases of police killing Black civilians. And the rulings quelled fears that Minneapolis would once again erupt in protest, arson and looting if the former officers were to avoid criminal prosecution.
Cahill also ruled that Chauvin's former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- will remain charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Attorneys for each of the defendants had filed motions to dismiss the charges against their clients.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, said he's confident Ellison's office will prevail at trial.
"We are gratified that the court preserved eight of the nine charges against Derek Chauvin, including the more serious second-degree murder charge for which we expect a conviction," Crump said in a written statement.
Ellison issued a statement noting that the rulings were a positive development.
"This is an important, positive step forward in the path toward justice for George Floyd, his family, our community, and Minnesota," the statement said.
Cahill gave Ellison five days to appeal the dismissal of the third-degree count.
The trial is scheduled to begin March 8. Cahill is weighing motions to move it out of the county based on pretrial publicity, civil unrest and recent threats made against Chauvin and his attorney.
The judge said at a Sept. 11 hearing that he did not have enough information to decide the matter yet, signaling a possibly longer wait on that matter.
Cahill is also expected to rule soon on a motion filed by Ellison's office to try the four defendants in one trial instead of separately.

Full text: From ramen to roast beef, our food writers highlight the favorites of their weekly dining experiences.
Roast beef sandwich at Maverick's Real Roast Beef
Arby's made the roast beef sandwich a commodity, but for the real thing, head to Maverick's.
Chef/owner Timothy Hughes
bought the business in 2018, and in the intervening years he's obviously been channeling his energies and skills into improving the kitchen's standards and slowly expanding the menu.
My go-to remains the classic roast beef sandwich ($8.99), a case study in how carefully considered preparation and uncomplicated presentation can yield jackpot-level payouts.
It's composed of lean eye of round that's roasted, low-and-slow (the math is roughly 12 to 14 hours at 140 to 180 degrees), until the deeply flavorful beef is ridiculously succulent and mouth-wateringly pink. The meat is thinly shaved to order, then generously stacked into a bun (from
Franklin Street Bakery
) that gets the toasted-
and-buttered treatment. As buns go, it's an ideal choice, because it manages to retain a softness while being sturdy enough to stand up to the beef's juices and an essential swoosh of the kitchen's snappy horseradish-sour cream sauce.
Next time, I'm going to try Hughes' open-faced version ($13.98, and also available with pulled pork or roast turkey), which incorporates a generous dollop of mashed potatoes and a pool of savory gravy into the equation.
"We make our potatoes and our gravies from scratch," he said. "It's perfect in the fall and winter because it's a big, hot, steamy plate of food. It'll warm you up and put you right to sleep."
(Rick Nelson)
1746 N. Lexington Av., Roseville, 651-493-9672. Open for dine-in, takeout and curbside pickup 11 a.m.-8 p.m. daily.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg cookies at PJ Murphy's Bakery
I like what they have done with the place.
"They" are spouses Francois Kiemde and Melissa Borgmann-Kiemde, and the "place" is the bakery that the couple purchased three years ago and have been quietly making their own, one pound of butter at a time.
Yes, Kiemde's croissants are a delight. The caramel-pecan coffee cake is temptation personified, and there's a reason why Twin Cities chefs are lining up to buy the first-rate sandwich buns. And, yes, the apple turnovers, prune kolaches and maple-iced long Johns are all worth a visit.
But right now, cookies are the bakery's most attention-getting attraction. Not just any cookie, but edible homages to the life and legacy of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
The idea for them popped up overnight, literally, following Ginsburg's death on Sept. 18.
"She died on a Friday, and I woke up on Saturday morning and shot a text to our decorator, Sharaya Mickelson, asking if there was anything we could do to honor the likeness of Ruth Bader Ginsburg," said Borgmann-Kiemde. "She immediately wrote back and said, 'Let me see what I can come up with.' "
A few months earlier, in the shadow of the police killing of George Floyd, the bakery launched a cookie-centric fundraiser to support Healing the Heart of Our City. They decided to follow a similar format with Ginsburg.
"We thought that making cookies would help people both grieve and celebrate her life," said Borgmann-Kiemde. "We kept circling as a staff and thinking about what we could do in support of women."
That brainstorming led to Sara's Oasis, a place for women seeking refuge and safety. The nonprofit receives $5 for every $30 pack-of-six cookies sold (order them online at pjmurphybakery.com).
"It's really taking off," said Borgmann-Kiemde. "At last count we were looking at a $500 donation. It's been a sweet spot for who we are as a bakery, and in our own little way to be a part of the community."
The RBG six-pack will be available through the U.S. Senate's confirmation hearings for Ginsburg's replacement, Amy Coney Barrett.
As for the cookies, they're delicious. That is, if you can bear to bite into them, because who wants to disrupt Mickelson's meticulous royal icing handiwork? They're the kind of soft-yet-crisp sugar cutout that I've never been able to perfect. Which is why I'm glad that there are bakeries.
In other news, although they're not quite ready to share the details, Kiemde and Borgmann-Kiemde are working on rebranding their 99-year-old bakery.
"It's growing into who we are," said Borgmann-Kiemde. "We're not P, or J." (R.N.)
1279 Randolph Av., St. Paul, 651-699-9292. Open 6 a.m.-noon Mon. and 6 a.m.-3 p.m. Tue.-Sat.
Ramen from Zen Box Izakaya
Takeout ramen is a tough order. The broth has to be hot, the noodles firm, the egg soft. That's an uphill battle when the Japanese soup has to travel across town in a plastic to-go container. But Lina Goh and her husband, John Ng, who own Zen Box Izakaya, engineered a way to get their ramen out the door with integrity by developing a take-home ramen kit.
"We never did takeout ramen before COVID," Goh said. "We had to think on our feet." Similar to how pho is often packaged at Vietnamese restaurants, they separate the broth from the toppings and give customers instructions on reassembling the dish at home so it's of restaurant quality.
This is one of several recent adaptations at the nine-year-old downtown Minneapolis restaurant. At the start of the pandemic, they turned to a pay-what-you-can model to ensure all guests could eat despite rampant unemployment. They witnessed downtown traffic slow to a trickle and then come to a halt after the riots following George Floyd's death. They installed a patio in late summer, even though ramen, their signature dish, isn't exactly what people want to eat on a 90-degree day. ("Although some people argue it's ramen season every day," Goh said.)
Now they're about to take the patio apart, and as of Nov. 1, are reverting back to takeout and delivery for the winter with a pared-down menu.
"Our staff are front-line workers and they're important to us, and their health and safety are important to us, so that's what we've decided to do," Goh said. "We have to start taking things away."
The ramen, thankfully, isn't going anywhere. The tonkotsu ramen ($15) is built from an astoundingly deep, 18-hour heritage pork bone broth. It's topped with slices of pork belly, strings of wood-ear mushrooms, seasoned bamboo shoots, a soft-boiled egg and black garlic oil. Those chewy noodles bring it all together, with the rich broth clinging to each wavy strand.
The dish is inspired by Goh and Ng's winter travels to Japan, and they hope its magic will sustain their business in takeout form this coming winter.
"It's cold, but when you eat ramen on the street, it warms you up instantly," Goh said. "It's the feeling that brings us back to Japan. It just warms your soul." (Sharyn Jackson)
602 Washington Av. S., Mpls., 612-332-3936. Open for takeout (and patio dining through Oct. 31). 4-8 p.m. Tue.-Sat.
Tandoor-baked salmon at Curry in a Hurry
The happiest news to come along in ages is that Ruhel Islam is back in the kitchen.
The chef/owner of Gandhi Mahal lost his popular south Minneapolis restaurant when it was destroyed in late May during the riots following George Floyd's death.
Islam estimates that rebuilding his 12-year-old business could take several years. In the meantime, he's picked up the lease of the former Chef Shack Ranch and has started a takeout-only operation. Talk about resilience.
The Curry in a Hurry menu reads as an abbreviated Gandhi Mahal greatest-hits roster. Islam is keeping his tandoor oven busy, deftly applying its concentrated heat to chicken, lamb and salmon. It's a smart strategy, because this style of cooking really travels well, a foil to the quality-dimming rigors that can dampen enthusiasm for takeout dining.
The salmon -- plentiful portions of thick fillets -- was dreamy ($18), its crisped-up exterior humming with a lively five-spice rub and its interior lusciously creamy and flaky. We paired it with a well-seasoned biryani peppered with crunchy cashews and sweet golden raisins, and of course Islam's soft, slightly tangy naan. A totally satisfying dinner, and an equally delicious lunch of leftovers the following day.
Yeah, this welcoming pop-up definitely belongs on your takeout rotation. (R.N.)
3025 E. Franklin Av., Mpls., 612-729-5222. Open 4-9 p.m. Tue.-Sun. Lunch service and delivery coming soon.
Cocktails at Cora's Lounge
My wanderlust is getting so bad that I even miss the chaos and frustration of travel. Heck, I'd take my shoes off just for a drink in an airport lounge. Fortunately, TSA screening is not necessary to get into Cora's Lounge, a just-opened extension of Holman's Table at St. Paul Downtown Airport.
Because of indoor dining restrictions, and the end of patio season, the already small restaurant with runway views is down to just 11 tables. So, the owners made a necessary expansion into the 1939 terminal's lobby, installing midcentury furnishings and offering small plates, cocktails and happy hour.
"It's all about trying to go back to that era, '40s, '50s, when this building was hopping," said co-owner Troy Reding.
The lounge is named after Cora M. Fuller, Minnesota's first licensed female pilot.
To lend the place some exclusivity, it has a different menu from the special occasion-worthy main dining room. A few signature items cross over, such as the $300 Burger, an homage -- with inflation -- to the age when pilots would land at the airport, fuel up and grab a burger for $100. At a recent preview of the new space, I marveled at that decadent burger, swimming in truffle gravy, melty foie gras slathered on top. Relax, it's not $300, just $18. (The rest of the menu stays well below $12.)
The highlight for me, though, was the cocktails. After months of home bartending, I still can't get over the luxuriousness of having someone mix me a drink. I ordered the Hemingway Was Here (rum, Luxardo, grapefruit and lime, $10) and my friend got a pretty serrano-pepper spiked paloma ($11). Pretty quickly, I got over my longing for beverage cart mini bottles at 35,000 feet. (S.J.)
644 Bayfield St., St. Paul, 612-800-5298. Lounge open 3-9 p.m. Tue.-Thu. and 3-10 p.m. Fri.-Sat.

Full text: Protesters streamed onto the Interstate 35W bridge just days after George Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police when, suddenly, a tanker truck barreled down the closed freeway.
Suwana Kirkland, a commander with the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office, watched in horror at the near disaster.
Three of her children were in the crowd, demonstrating against police excessive force. Miraculously, no one was hurt by the driver, who state officials say may not have known the road was closed.
"I've raised my children to stand, to be present, to be impactful," she said of the peaceful protests while condemning looting and rioting. "I agree with them wanting to see better from law enforcement. We all know that we've got some work to do in this state."
As president of the state chapter of the National Black Police Association, Kirkland is among Minnesota law enforcement leaders responding at a critical time to rebuild trust and diversify a predominantly white profession. Amid rising tensions over policing and racial justice, Kirkland's phone is ringing nonstop with requests to speak to Twin Cities community groups and journalists from the BBC to the New York Times.
"The world is watching Minnesota," said Kirkland, who has led the chapter since 2019, an all-volunteer position, and is the vice chairwoman of the national association. "As Black law enforcement leaders, we're being asked to speak up and to be part of the reform, to be part of the improvement, to be part of
the change … For those of us who truly want to see better, this is it."
The association, which has about 150 members -- from students to corrections and patrol officers, including several white sheriffs and police chiefs -- has boosted outreach, from meeting with community groups to volunteering to feed people facing homelessness. The chapter, one of 23 in the U.S., has also focused on mentoring and diversifying hiring as well as increasing mental health help for officers, adding a chaplain to take calls.
"It hit home, especially for a lot of officers of color," Kirkland said of Floyd's death and the aftermath.
She opposes the calls from some activists and Minneapolis City Council members to defund or dismantle police departments. In a Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll, a majority of Minneapolis residents surveyed opposed reducing the size of the police department, with half of Black residents against reductions. In the poll, residents did overwhelmingly support shifting some funding to social service programs.
Kirkland agrees that reforms are needed -- from more implicit bias training to increasing de-escalation training to reduce the use of force.
"We might wear a uniform. We might carry a gun and a badge. But we're people just like you," said Kirkland, 48, of Rogers. "We want what's best for the community."
When she's out in the community, she often gets asked the same question.
"Everyone wants to know -- especially if you're a Black law enforcement officer -- they want to know, 'How are you surviving?' " said Kirkland, a mother of five children, ages 9 to 27. "Before I'm anything, I'm a woman. Before I'm anything, I'm a mother. Before I'm anything, I'm a person. And things that affect the general community, they affect us as well. And we've seen some difficult days."
Diversifying the profession
Kirkland was a trailblazer when she landed her first job in 2005 with Minnetonka Police: the first African American to join the suburban department. Then at Ramsey County, she was the first African American female hired as deputy sheriff and the first to be promoted to sergeant and commander.
Now, she's looking to inspire the next generation. She started a women's academy at the Ramsey County Sheriff's Office, which is a women's-only introduction to law enforcement, and teaches at North Hennepin Community College.
Of about 11,000 officers in Minnesota, 12% -- nearly 1,300 -- are women, according to the state Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training. Kirkland estimates there are 270 Black officers, 2% of law enforcement, despite Black Minnesotans representing nearly 7% of the state's population, according to the Census. There are even fewer Black women, especially in leadership roles, she said; of four Black police chiefs, all are men.
"We've got work to do," Kirkland said.
Bridging the gap
Law enforcement wasn't her first career. Kirkland worked as a real estate agent before enrolling at 29 at Minneapolis Community & Technical College (MCTC) to study psychology. She worked for Hennepin County Medical Center in records in the high pressure and sometimes deadly world of the cardiac/renal floor.
But, intrigued by criminal justice, she switched fields, propelled into a new career and passion.
"She's doing an exceptional job," said Nick Kellum, a former St. Paul police officer who started the Minnesota chapter of the National Black Police Association in 2008.
There are similar statewide associations such as for Asian and Somali American officers.
"We're trying to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the community," added Kellum, who teaches at MCTC. "It's hard being Black in this uniform."
Black officers, he said, are likely asked more to respond to the killing of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky or Floyd, both of which he condemns. "Wrong is wrong," he said. "The community thinks you have the answer for everything. That's why I think departments have to be more diverse."
Besides hiring more people of color, Kirkland said officers have to get out in the community more, not just show up when someone calls 911.
"Law enforcement has gotten away from telling the community about why you're doing what you're doing," she said. "Every day, I wake up and ... I'm working for someone other than myself. I'm working to make the profession, the interactions and the engagement better."

Judge rejects hold on Floyd filings: Defense wants to admit video from his May 2019 arrest by Mpls. police.

Full text: A Hennepin County District Judge overseeing the prosecution of four former officers charged in the May 25 killing of George Floyd has denied a prosecution request for a 48-hour seal on filings in the case.
Judge Peter Cahill announced the decision at a hearing Thursday after a defense attorney moved Monday to file into evidence a video and transcript from Floyd's arrest by Minneapolis police in May 2019 -- a year before he died in custody on a south Minneapolis street corner.
Cahill said the video "shows what basically everybody already knows: George Floyd was arrested on a previous occasion." He said he would not build in any additional time lag on the release of filings in the case, but added that he won't allow audio, video or photos attached to future filings. That material, if deemed public, will be available at the courthouse, however.
A media coalition, including the Star Tribune, opposed the prosecution motion and received the document as a party in an ongoing dispute over what documents are public in the case. The document and video at issue, submitted by lawyer Earl Gray, highlights similarities in Floyd's behavior in 2019 to what was seen on video in his fatal 2020 encounter with police.
Cahill dispensed with the matter in a 25-minute hearing. He explained that an electronic lag exists between when a document is submitted through the court's e-filing system and when it is accepted by a court clerk and becomes part of the official case record.
The prosecutors sought to build a permanent, 48-hour lag into the process, giving them time to object to filings and keep them out of public view. Prosecutor Matthew Frank accused the defense of "e-mailing things" to the court "just to make them public." This practice, Frank argued, was likely to interfere with a fair trial.
Cahill, however, dismissed that criticism. "I do find that this was good faith on Mr. Gray's part because I left the door open," Cahill said of the
possible admission at trial of the 2019 arrest.
The judge noted that he had closed the door on admitting evidence of an armed robbery in Texas involving Floyd. Had Gray's filings included specifics of that case, that would have been in bad faith, Cahill said.
Cahill also said he viewed the 2019 arrest video as potentially helpful to the prosecution's case. The document and video became publicly available immediately after the hearing. What wasn't at issue Thursday was whether the earlier arrest video will be shown to the jury during trial. That ruling will come closer to or during the trial currently set to begin March 8.
According to Gray's memo, he wants to show the video at trial because prosecutors have presented a "false narrative" by portraying Floyd as a "law-abiding citizen that was afraid for his life." In the video, as described by Gray, three police officers were working to get Floyd to respond to commands to show his hands, stop moving around and spit out something he had put in his mouth. Floyd cried out for his "mama" and told police, "Don't shoot me, man."
Gray represents Thomas Lane, who is charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao face the same charges, while former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck, is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
All lawyers were present for Thursday's hearing, but only Gray stopped briefly on his way out of the courthouse to speak to reporters. After a few minutes, 10K Foundation activist Jonathan Mason grew argumentative and cut off Gray's comments to reporters.
Mason pressed Gray about alleged prior behavior by Chauvin. The lawyer responded that he doesn't represent Chauvin.
As Gray turned to leave, Mason drew close to him and followed him out, accusing him of "protecting a killer." The two men appeared on the verge of exchanging blows.
Gray accused Mason of being under the influence of alcohol; Mason accused Gray of being "afraid" of him.
Despite heavy security, it's the second consecutive hearing on the case that ended in a potentially explosive confrontation of defense counsel. A woman was charged with damaging another lawyer's truck after a Sept. 11 hearing as angry protesters followed and yelled "murderer" at two former police officers and their lawyers on the way out of the courthouse.
Mason told reporters he's not done protesting. "Derek Chauvin will not be allowed to walk free," he said.
Hennepin County sheriff's deputies handcuffed two protesters in the courthouse later in the afternoon. A group of about eight protesters walked around the skyway level of the courthouse a little before 3 p.m.
An unidentified man who yelled "Kill Derek Chauvin!" was handcuffed, searched and taken away after Hennepin County sheriff's deputies apparently found a black handgun on him.
Sheriff's spokesman Andy Skoogman said the man was arrested because an officer recognized him as someone wanted in connection to an Aug. 15 riot and property damage incident that occurred near the Fifth Precinct police station. He was booked into the county jail for probable cause weapons possession, Skoogman said. Guns are prohibited in the courthouse except for law enforcement.
Deputies also handcuffed protester Sara Marshall, 24, who was standing near the man but said she did not know him. She was released after being questioned for about 45 minutes.
"It was traumatizing," Marshall said.
In the brief hearing, Cahill didn't hint at when he might rule on several other significant motions that were argued Sept. 11. They include motions to dismiss the charges against the former officers, to try them separately, and to change the venue of their trials because of pretrial publicity.

Full text: Prosecutors in the death of George Floyd have asked the court to take the extraordinary step of withholding all case filings from public view for at least two days, including the most recent defense filing that detailed his 2019 arrest.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill scheduled a hearing at 12:30 p.m. Thursday to hear arguments about the prosecution's request. A media coalition, including the Star Tribune, opposes the motion. Multiple legal analysts described both motions as general pretrial jockeying, but said the prosecution's request to seal documents interferes with the public's right to access court proceedings.
At issue was a motion filed Monday by Earl Gray on behalf of his client, former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane, who held down Floyd's legs when he was arrested May 25 and died in police custody. Gray wants to include video from an incident on May 6, 2019, when Floyd was a passenger in a vehicle that had been
stopped by the Minneapolis police.
According to Gray's memo, three police officers were working to get Floyd to respond to commands to show his hands, stop moving around and spit out something he had put in his mouth. Floyd cried out for his "mama" and told police, "Don't shoot me, man," according to the memo. The behavior was strikingly similar to Floyd's behavior during the arrest that resulted in his death a year later.
The Star Tribune obtained the filing because it's a party in an ongoing dispute over what documents are public in the case. Gray's filing was not released to the public nor did it appear on the public website for the case as of Tuesday, although several prosecution motions filed Monday are listed.
Instead, Gray's motion and the body camera footage from the 2019 arrest remain under seal, apparently because prosecutors filed a motion seeking to bar the immediate release of documents in the case.
Prosecutor Matthew Frank seeks to suppress all motions and exhibits in the case from public view for at least two days. "This will permit the parties to review those filings before they are made available to the public and, if necessary, to notify the Court within two business days of their intent to oppose public disclosure," he wrote.
If the parties oppose public release of the documents, they can request to file briefs and hold arguments on withholding them, Frank wrote. This would ensure that "potentially confidential, prejudicial, or inadmissible information is not improperly or prematurely released," he said.
Mitchell Hamline School of Law Prof. Raleigh Hannah Levine, who specializes in First Amendment issues, said such an arrangement would delay public access to the documents well beyond two days. She said the U.S. Supreme Court heavily supports public access to pretrial activity.
"It is a rare case in which the value of public access will not outweigh privacy or other concerns," Levine said. Motions such as Frank's "largely don't succeed at the higher court," she added.
Retired Hennepin County Judge Kevin Burke agreed, saying the pretrial documents should be public.
"The difficulty with some lawyers is they believe in transparency at their own news conferences, but after that, forget it," Burke said.
He described both the prosecution and Gray's motion as routine pretrial maneuvering, laying the framework of their cases.
Burke said there was no rush for Cahill to rule on whether to allow the evidence at trial of Floyd's behavior in his 2019 arrest. Judges have broad discretion on such evidentiary matters and Cahill can decide later, Burke said.
Gray argued in his latest motion that Floyd's behavior in the 2019 encounter is relevant to his client's defense because prosecutors have presented a "false narrative" by portraying Floyd as a "law-abiding citizen that was afraid for his life."
Instead, Gray said, Floyd's behavior in the earlier arrest is "almost an exact replica" of how he behaved during his fatal encounter with police a year later outside Cup Foods in south Minneapolis. The defense lawyer noted that Floyd cried, mumbled and yelled throughout his interview with the police and claimed that's how he behaves under "the influence of a pill."
The only difference between the fatal 2020 incident and the earlier arrest, Gray wrote, is "Floyd complied when getting into the squad car on May 6, 2019."
Gray is seeking dismissal of the charges against his client, Lane, who is charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao face the same charges, while former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck, is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Floyd fell silent, yet torment went on: Prosecutor's new filing casts more light on death.

Full text: Prosecutors' latest narrative of George Floyd's final moments reveal that Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned George Floyd's neck to the ground for 9½ minutes, longer than previously cited, according to a court filing Tuesday.
The motion, in which Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's team argues for the admissibility of key evidence, provides the most detailed account yet of Floyd's final moments as attributed to body camera footage from three of the officers that has since been made public.
It says the officers pinned Floyd to the asphalt for about 9 minutes, 30 seconds -- longer than the 7 minutes, 46 seconds and 8 minutes, 46 seconds previously cited by prosecutors, the latter time stamp having been adopted by activists as a symbol for police brutality in protests following Floyd's May 25 death.
Both Floyd and those in a growing crowd pleaded for his life, but "for over four and a half of those minutes, Floyd was silent," according to the court document. "For at least three of those minutes, Floyd appeared not to be breathing. And for at least two and a half minutes, the officers were unable to locate Floyd's pulse.
"After Floyd fell silent, the crowd alerted the officers 10 times that Floyd was no longer moving, warned them nine times that Floyd was unresponsive, and pleaded with them nearly 30 times to check Floyd's pulse."
Four former officers are charged in relation to Floyd's death. Chauvin faces charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- who helped hold Floyd down -- and Tou Thao, who held back the crowd, are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All four have been fired.
The court document depicted Lane as quick to draw his firearm and scream obscenities at Floyd, who was sitting in his car when he and Kueng arrived. In another instance as Floyd pleaded to breathe, Chauvin responded: "You're doing a lot of talking, a lot of yelling. It takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to say things."
The body camera video captured Kueng reacting to Chauvin's comments with a smirk, according to the filing.
Early in the encounter, after the officers handcuffed Floyd, Kueng brought Floyd to the curb and asked him to sit down. "Floyd did so, immediately becoming calmer and saying thank you to Kueng three times," according to the court document.
Later, Floyd appeared afraid to be in the car alone, repeatedly telling the officers he suffered claustrophobia. After Chauvin and Kueng pinned him against the back seat, Thao said they were "just going to have to hogtie him." Floyd shouted "I can't breathe" almost a dozen times after they pinned him to the ground, according to the motion.
A growing crowd shouted concerns that Floyd couldn't breathe and he "wasn't even resisting arrest."
"He's talking, so he's fine," said Thao. "This is why you don't do drugs, kids."
An off-duty Minneapolis firefighter introduced herself and asked to give Floyd medical assistance, and Chauvin, holding a can of Mace, warned her to stay away.
When Floyd passed out, Lane asked the others if they should roll him on his side in a recovery position, a suggestion he repeated as the crowd expressed concerns over Floyd being unresponsive. "Chauvin rejected that option out of hand, telling Lane and Kueng to 'stay put where you got him,' " according to the document.
"Just leave him," Kueng concurred.
Kueng finally complied with the crowd's pleas to check Floyd's pulse.
"I can't find one," Kueng reported. He tried again 10 seconds later, then leaned back and sighed. "I can't find one."
Still, the officers held him there -- Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck, Lane and Kueng atop Floyd's legs and back, Thao on crowd control -- for another two minutes and thirty seconds.
"The officers also ignored the off-duty firefighter's plea for them to begin chest compressions," says the motion. "Indeed, none of the officers ever attempted CPR while Floyd was on the ground."
When paramedics arrived, Lane told them Floyd wasn't responsive and they leaned to check his neck for a pulse. Chauvin still kept his knee pressed into Floyd's neck.
Floyd was pronounced dead later at the hospital. The Hennepin County medical examiner ruled Floyd died from "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression," listing the cause as "homicide." A separate medical examiner also listed "police subdual and restraint" as the cause of death.
Ellison's motion also argues for the admissibility of the officers' histories, saying their past shows a pattern of behavior, knowledge of their actions and that their use of force went beyond what was necessary.
Many of the accounts include Chauvin using force, sometimes while working security off-duty, on people who don't comply with his commands. In one case, Chauvin "delivered a few strikes" to a juvenile who was not cooperating, then "applied a neck restraint" and rolled him over to handcuff him. The juvenile was bleeding from the ear after the struggle and needed stitches.

GOP report says Frey, Walz failed to quell unrest: Democratic leaders reject findings, call document fodder for election.

Full text: A report by Minnesota Senate Republicans three weeks before the election argues that DFL Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey failed to do enough to quell the days of looting and arson that followed the police killing of George Floyd.
The 61-page report, compiled after a series of summer hearings on the topic, blames what Republicans have long argued was an apparent lack of understanding of the quickly escalating situation and a hesitation to deploy additional law enforcement to end the violence and destruction in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
The report follows months of criticism by President Donald Trump and state Republicans, who have turned the civil unrest that followed Floyd's death into a campaign theme emphasizing law and order and support for police.
Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests against police brutality and racism across the globe. In the Twin Cities, more than 1,500 properties, including the Third Precinct police
building in south Minneapolis, were damaged or destroyed over several days. Some were looted on multiple nights.
"One central theme emerged fairly quickly during our hours of testimony: the governor's slow decisionmaking caused the riots to be far, far worse than they should have been," said Sen. Scott Newman, R-Hutchinson, Transportation Committee chairman, who co-authored the report.
Senate Democrats described the report as a political document that they were given little time to review. A statement by state Sens. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, and Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, also accused Republicans of overlooking the underlying causes of the disturbances.
"They completely failed to acknowledge what caused the unrest in the first place, the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers," they said. "They fail to face the issues of structural racism, racial injustice, and lack of police accountability reforms in the Senate."
Newman said he plans to convene another public hearing of the joint committee so members from both parties can weigh in on the report. He insisted that "the purpose of the report was not political."
Walz still questioned the timing of the report and defended his administration's response to the aftermath of Floyd's death.
"I know that getting close to an election they need to do that," he said. "I would just ask them to work with us on this. Let's say we all agree on this, for public safety, and I think the mayor and I certainly believe our administration … whether it be the National Guard, the State Patrol or the DNR [Department of Natural Resources] our front line folks responded in a noble and heroic manner. They saved lives."
"A one-sided report coming out right before an election isn't as helpful," said Walz, a 24-year veteran of the National Guard. "But if there is helpful advice in there, I'll certainly take it."
Walz and other top leaders have previously defended their decisions, saying they did the best they could to respond to a complex and fast-changing situation. State and local officials have also sparred over who was to blame for communication problems related to mobilizing the National Guard.
The administration has said the response was the fastest and largest National Guard deployment in state history. But the state is commissioning its own independent external review analyzing the unrest and the administration's response.
The GOP report, signed by Newman and Judiciary and Public Safety Chairman Warren Limmer, R-Maple Grove, identifies what Republicans say are a number of lapses with the state and local response. The authors argue that Walz's team "failed to distinguish between demonstrators and rioters" and that city and state leaders did not act decisively enough.
The report, based on public hearings, news coverage and social media posts, argues that officials should have increased the law enforcement and National Guard presence sooner and authorized the use of additional nonlethal forces. It rejects concerns expressed at the time that a bigger law enforcement presence could actually inflame tensions and make the situation worse.
"Governor Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey initially chose to negotiate with and appease the rioters rather than give law enforcement the authority to cmonfront criminal acts with enough force to restore law and order," the senators wrote. "Inaction on the part of state and local officials led to an increase in violence."
The report does not mention Derek Chauvin, the officer filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck before he died, or the history of questions surrounding the Minneapolis Police Department that many activists and outside experts say fueled distrust and frustration in the community after the video of the incident went viral. It also does not address the role social media might have played in spreading confusion and disinformation during the unrest.
Senate Republicans included a number of recommendations for dealing with future disturbances, including developing a comprehensive state plan to address rioting, prosecuting those who "commit criminal acts under the guise of social protest" and facilitating a "frank and open conversation about social injustice."
"It is unlikely that the 2020 Minnesota riots are the last episodes of lawlessness the state will experience," the senators wrote. "With the nation deeply divided by political, economic, and social tensions, even a small incident could spark a new wave of lawlessness. The time to begin preparing for 'next time' is now."
The report was based on hearings conducted by the Senate's Republican majority. At the time, Democrats criticized their GOP colleagues for politicizing the unrest instead of focusing on rebuilding or addressing police brutality and racism.
The release of the report, 21 days before the Nov. 3 election, comes as both sides escalate messaging wars in the fight for control of the Legislature.

Can opera make an impact? It's his job: Meet the Minnesota Opera's new V.P. of impact, Lee Bynum.

Full text: Special to the Star Tribune
"Impact: the force of impression of one thing on another, a significant or major effect."
The dictionary definition is as good a place as any to start in describing the job Lee Bynum has just begun at Minnesota Opera.
"Vice President of Impact" is Bynum's official title, one that skirts the boundaries of corporate management self-parody.
Behind the jargon, though, is a serious issue -- 2020 is a year that has deeply affected opera, calling into question its continuing relevance in an era riven by racial division, political upheaval and the merciless impact of the coronavirus.
Bynum pulls no punches in considering the gravity of the situation.
"In the moment we're in now, if we don't master a new set of demographic realities, we are not necessarily going to have classical music and opera in the way we've had it in the past."
The past Bynum is talking about has been overwhelmingly white in color.
White singers and audiences. White male composers. Opera has mainly looked that way for centuries
now, despite sporadic efforts to make it more representative of broader society.
The difficulties of addressing that situation have been highlighted by the recent controversy surrounding the firing of the Black Classical MPR host Garrett McQueen and renewed debate over the role of "blind auditions" -- in which musicians play anonymously behind a screen -- in the hiring of players for orchestras.
For Bynum, the time for change is now, because the tragedy and trauma of 2020 has, paradoxically, created a major opportunity for change to happen.
"After the unfortunate murder of George Floyd a few months ago, classical music is paying attention to broader social issues right now in a way that it hasn't always been," he said.
"And because Minnesota Opera has always had a reputation for being an innovator and very forward-thinking in terms of what it presents and for whom, it was a natural fit for me."
Bynum has spent a considerable chunk of his career so far in educational settings, including spells at Columbia University and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, where he administered diversity, equity and inclusion grants to colleges and universities.
So why the switch to opera? And why now, when the COVID-19 crisis hangs like a threatening sword of Damocles over arts organizations across America?
For Bynum, 40, flipping to opera does not feel like a major change of direction. Born in Richmond, Va., he was raised in surrounding Henrico County before moving to Manhattan in his late teens. Classical music is in his blood, Bynum says.
"I grew up in classical music from age 8, with instrumental music and singing, and for a while I also worked as a composer," he said. "Minnesota Opera seems more of a homecoming than a hard pivot."
So what exactly will Bynum do as the company's vice president of impact, a newly created position? What does he feel most urgently needs to happen?
Impact, Bynum says, is first and foremost about "making opera more accessible for a much wider range of individuals" -- people with disabilities, non-baby boomers, LGBTQ people, female composers and people of color, for example.
But how to reach them? How do you bring the marginalized into the operatic fold?
Outreach programs to schools and local community organizations will continue to be part of the answer. "New and deeper connections with the community" is how Bynum puts it.
But changes in the way that younger generations approach music also pose a major challenge.
"Generation Xers, millennials, and Generation Z, they haven't been conditioned to appreciate classical music in quite the same way as in the past," Bynum said. "They are hungry to have the relevance of music explained to them, what impact it is making on our society. We need to have some answers."
"Opera in the Outfield," Minnesota Opera's recent baseball-themed event at CHS Field in St. Paul, and the online stream of Bernard Herrmann's opera "Wuthering Heights" (available Oct. 10-24 at mnopera.org), are steps in the right direction.
But making sure the music created and performed at Minnesota Opera "matches the demographics" of the Twin Cities area will be crucial to keeping the company viable in the longer term, Bynum argues.
"Unless the industry models shift, the traditional audience for classical music will continue to shrink," he says. "And by the time we get to 2042, when we live in a society that will be predominantly people of color, we have to make sure that opera is still speaking to them."
Bynum has no doubt that Minnesota Opera can keep its relevance in an era when the pace of change is dizzying, and upheaval is a way of life for many people.
"If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be moving my husband and my cat across the country from Manhattan in the middle of the worst public health crisis we've had in a century," he said, smiling.
But Bynum's move to Minneapolis is intentional and timely, not rawly career-driven. The George Floyd killing has, he thinks, created a moment of moral reckoning for the city, and he is confident that Minnesota Opera can play its part in a solution.
"So many people think opera stopped speaking about what we are as a society about a hundred years ago. But I think opera has an incredible capacity to examine larger-than-life ideas at an incredibly human level.
"And if we want to help address current issues like food insecurity and affordable housing, that has to come through the music. We need to use it to get people thinking how we can be better to each other."

Woman, 24, charged with damaging lawyer's car: He and defendants in George Floyd case had just left hearing.

Full text: A 24-year-old woman has been charged with a felony after a group of angry protesters damaged the vehicle of a lawyer for a fired Minneapolis police officer implicated in the death of George Floyd.
Edith N. Okerlund, 24, of St. Paul, appeared in Hennepin County District Court on Friday on charges of first-degree property damage, a felony, and gross-misdemeanor riot in connection with attorney Thomas Plunkett's allegations that demonstrators threatened him, client J. Alexander Kueng, co-defendant Thomas Lane and another defense lawyer as they left the courthouse after a hearing last month.
Plunkett wrote in a memo filed in court on Oct. 1 that the encounter further supports the defense's call for the four former officers' trials to be moved out of Hennepin County.
Okerlund was arrested and jailed Wednesday, then released two days later. Messages were left for her Sunday seeking her comment.
Defense attorney Jordan Kushner said Sunday that Okerlund did not damage the vehicle and that he has supporting video. At the same time, he said, "the video doesn't show everything that's going on."
According to the charges, first reported by KMSP-TV: Plunkett and Earl Gray, the defense attorney for former officer Lane, were walking from the Hennepin County Government Center with their clients to Plunkett's vehicle parked at a meter on Sept. 11 when they were approached by about 20 people.
Plunkett said the group surrounded his vehicle and pounded on it with a drumstick, fists and a bicycle as the lawyer and the rest of his group sat inside.
Gray said he saw a woman, later identified as Okerlund, strike Plunkett's vehicle with a bicycle.
Plunkett added that some protesters were calling for him and Gray "to be murdered for their representation" of Kueng and Lane, the criminal complaint read.
Plunkett drove from the scene, saw the damage to his vehicle and provided an estimate to police that it was in excess of $2,000.
According to Plunkett's filing, one protester punched and grabbed Gray; others blocked Lane as he walked on the street; and Lane was physically assaulted.
Attorneys for Kueng, Lane and co-defendants Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao are arguing that news coverage of Floyd's May 25 death while in police custody has tainted the local jury pool. Judge Peter Cahill, who is overseeing the case, has yet to rule on the matter.
Floyd's death following his arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill at Cup Foods in south Minneapolis was captured on a bystander's cellphone. The video went viral, prompting worldwide outrage and unrest.

QUEST FOR DIVERSITY LED THEM TO CITIES: THE LUNDQUISTS SEE TWIN CITIES AS A BETTER FIT POLITICALLY AND CULTURALLY

Author: Hyatt, Kim

Full text: A pilgrimage to the George Floyd memorial in Minneapolis this summer confirmed what the Lundquist family had thought for a long time: They could no longer live in the overwhelmingly white city of Roseau, Minn.
In September, the family of eight moved 340 miles south to Brooklyn Park -- one of the most diverse cities in the state, with 57% of residents identifying as Black, Indigenous and people of color.
Two of Kate and Jacob Lundquist's six children are adopted from Haiti and were often the only students of color in classrooms in Roseau, whose population is 97% white.
"I'm doing the opposite of white flight," Kate said from their new home with framed pictures still in bubble wrap. "We made the decision and eight weeks later, we turned our entire life upside down."
Even though Floyd was killed in the Twin Cities, the Lundquists were drawn to the metro by its diversity and anti-racist activism. They contrast it with what they heard in Roseau after Floyd's death in May.
Kate said people she considered friends and neighbors were saying Floyd deserved it, that he was a criminal.
"I've been watching how people react to the death of unarmed Black people for years now, and it's just very subtle. But when George Floyd died, it wasn't so subtle anymore. That was scary. As a mom, you just think, 'Well, what if that was my kid? How would my community react? Would they fight with me? Or would they
tell me that the world is better off without them?' And that's why we're here."
In early June, Kate packed the minivan and drove six hours with her Haitian-born sons Nelson, 11, and Maki, 9, along with son Ridge, 9, and daughter Charlotte, 11, to visit the memorial in south Minneapolis. Jacob stayed home with 2-year-old Verabeth and eldest daughter Addi, 14.
The experience at 38th and Chicago Avenue, known as George Floyd Square, was so transformative that it served as the final push for the Lundquists to leave Roseau after 16 years -- not only in the midst of a pandemic and political uprising sparked in the city they wanted to call home, but also breast cancer treatment for Kate, now in remission, and just in time for the start of a new school year.
A month after the visit, Jacob had a job offer in the Twin Cities, and they put their house on the market.
Kate said signs of affirmation for their migration are everywhere, and literal, like the abundance of Black Lives Matter flags comparable to the Trump 2020 signs Up North. Their neighbors are Asian, Ethiopian and Egyptian. Nelson has his first Black male teacher -- a "racial mirror" the family longed for.
"I've only had white women as teachers here in America," Nelson said during another day of distance learning in which he and his siblings spread out throughout the house with laptops and headphones. He still wears a Roseau Rams T-shirt.
Over the years, Kate, 39, heard from other transracial families about moving to be near diversity -- whether that meant a different school district with more dynamic demographics or a completely new city. For kids adopted into families that don't look like them, she knew this was a crucial transition. "Love wasn't enough," she said.
"When my Black sons have something that's difficult for them in relation to their race, nobody's going to understand. [Roseau] wasn't the best soil for us to grow anymore," Kate said. "And now that I'm here, I feel this huge gap fill, and it's filling fast."
Alexis Oberdorfer, president of Children's Home Society of Minnesota, which provides adoption services, said the Lundquists are not the first transracial family she's heard of moving to the metro area for more diversity.
Oberdorfer views this from a professional lens but also a personal one. She is raising adopted children and is an adult transracial adoptee who moved to a white community in the suburbs of the Twin Cities shortly after she was born in Chicago in 1971. So she understands the importance of children of color seeing their race and culture reflected in their everyday lives.
"Being an African American family, race is a routine discussion we have in our house, pre- and post-George Floyd," she said. "When you're raising a child of color ... they need to have proximity and access to individuals and communities of color."
Oberdorfer said she helps transracial adoptive families create a bridge to make their adopted child feel comfortable in school, church and their community. "You have to have positive influences where they can see themselves reflected."
It's not that Roseau is without diversity. Like many rural communities across the state in the past 10 years, more people of color are moving in, according to state demographer Susan Brower.
In Roseau and neighboring Warroad, Polaris and Marvin Windows are big employers of Laotians and Puerto Ricans.
"The vast majority of greater Minnesota counties are only growing because of populations of color the past decade," Brower said.
Longtime Roseau Mayor Jeff Pelowski said he thinks of his city as a welcoming place. "I'm not aware of any racist problems in Roseau. I will argue till I'm blue in the face that there's not a racist mentality here," he said. But he recognized that as a white man, he can't fully comprehend what it would be like as a person of color living in the community. "We assume you're one of us. It's easy to overlook."
Nadine Yanok, a family friend who lives in Warroad, can relate to the Lundquists' decision to move. Adopted from Haiti as a baby along with her sister, Yanok, now 23, has a 1-year-old of her own.
"I told [Kate] how much it touches me to see what she's doing for her kids because that's what me and my sister always wished for," Yanok said. "It's going to mean a lot to those boys."
Jacob Lundquist, 38, said he's been ready to move for years. It's been increasingly difficult to live Up North where their political views don't align with the city and county where voters overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016. Since then, he said the division continued to worsen. Bible studies would turn political and he felt like a progressive outlier.
He deactivated social media as a way to avoid some of the tension that he said was so apparent that "you can taste it." Recently, during his first visit to the Floyd memorial, he described the moment as a somber reminder of why they uprooted their lives.
"This had to happen now. It felt right. The Cities was the right spot. I'm excited for the future, for the kids, for the culture," he said. "We thought we were doing everything right, protecting them but sheltering them in a bad way."
The kids started to notice the tension in town before moving, too. Addi said her support of Black Lives Matter meant losing friendships and feeling isolated. At a BLM rally in Roseau the Lundquists attended, Kate said it was good to see dozens of people come out with signs in support, but it also put on full display the reasons they felt they needed to move: People drove by revving their engines and shouting insults.
A pastor confronted a protester in disapproval, Kate said, so she started hosting church at her house during their last weeks in Roseau.
Not long after their migration south, Kate said she and Maki went searching for a Sunday service and returned to the Floyd memorial. That's where this summer she saw her children's heart for humanity grow before her eyes, and her Black children blend in with the crowd for the first time.
Kate said she often thinks of Floyd's 6-year-old daughter, Gigi, saying that "Daddy changed the world."
"[Floyd] changed my world," she said. "He brought us to Minneapolis."

TOWN LASHES OUT AT FLOYD'S UNCLE: S.D. RESIDENTS GO FULL CONFEDERATE OVER FLAG ISSUE

Full text: GETTYSBURG, S.D. - Selwyn Jones moved to his wife's hometown of Gettysburg, S.D., four years ago, bought a motel and settled in for a quiet life in the country.
But not long after his nephew, George Floyd, was killed by Minneapolis police in May, Jones found himself an unlikely voice for social justice. The first time, it was amid a throng of television cameras in downtown Minneapolis decrying his nephew's death. Not long after, Jones led the charge to remove Confederate flag-adorned patches from the uniforms of Gettysburg police.
Finding that voice came at a cost.
The backlash against Jones, who is Black, was immediate as hundreds of people from the town of 1,162 and elsewhere took to Facebook calling for the flag's return. They attacked both him and his late nephew, and eventually, the personal jabs evolved into attacks on Black Lives Matter (BLM) and the broader call for racial equity.
"What I know is power and control showed up: 'We're not going to do anything to change the patch because a Black guy that got murdered [has an uncle who lives] in our town,' " Jones said on a recent September morning. "There's progress in every place of the world -- every nook and cranny -- except in my little town."
The reaction within the town settled by Union soldiers and named after a Northern victory over the proslavery South didn't surprise Jones.
"If you're offended by a piece of cloth, but think dealing drugs to kids is alright, you might be this moron," said one post with Jones' picture.
The turmoil in Gettysburg, about 350 miles west of the Twin Cities, is among many signs nationally of racially charged expression erupting more in public life, even becoming normalized. Many civic and political leaders are worried that President Donald Trump's rhetoric and lack of condemnation of white supremacy is emboldening those who hold such beliefs.
University of St. Thomas Prof. Lisa Waldner, who has studied white supremacy for 20 years, reviewed posts from a private Facebook group, "Gettysburg South Dakota FOR FREEDOM," created to support the Confederate flag and mock Floyd and Jones.
"I certainly think they reflect white supremacy ideology," said Waldner, a professor of sociology and criminal justice and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. "White supremacists will say, 'We're not against Black people, we just don't think Black people should get special treatment.' Or, they'll say, 'We love white history.' "
The main grievance among the group's approximately 342 members appears to be that their voices went unheard in the decision to do away with the Confederate flag logo.
"This man lives in Gettysburg … and we have reason to BELIEVE was planted there to cause problems and demand the Confederate Flag patch to be removed …" one woman wrote under the picture of Jones. "… How does ONE guy influence a whole town to get rid of Americas [sic] history …"
Monty Mikkelsen, who created the Facebook group, said he, the group and the flag are not racist.
"If someone don't like the comments being put on there they are more than welcome to go somewhere else," said Mikkelsen, who lives 60 miles away in Pierre. "These are people that are speaking their mind."
Mikkelsen, 47, organized a pro-flag rally in late July in Gettysburg. He regularly demonstrates in Pierre with pro-Trump, Confederate and anti-BLM flags.
Going home
Jones, 54, moved from his home state of North Carolina to Rapid City, S.D., in 1999 to play arena football. He met his wife, Joie Jones, there two years later.
After having two children, ages 7 and 4, the call to return to Gettysburg lured them back in 2014. Joie's mother also lives in the small town nestled among sunflower and soybean fields.
The interracial couple -- Joie is white -- bought the shuttered Sage Motel, began renovations and rebranded as KJ's Inn and Suites. They opened in late 2019.
Months later a video showing then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes thrust them into the spotlight. Chauvin and three colleagues who responded to a call May 25 that Floyd allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill are charged in his death; a trial is scheduled for next year.
The day Floyd was buried in early June, a South Dakota reporter called Jones and asked his opinions of the police badge.
"My first thought was, 'You're kidding me, right?' " said Jones, who was not aware it featured the flag until the call. "I started laughing."
Jones called Mayor Bill Wuttke, who defended the badge, and Police Chief Dave Mogard. He asked for its removal. He voiced his dismay in articles published around the state and country.
"It just went to hell from there," Jones said.
Before the City Council could vote on the matter in early July, Mogard quietly removed the badge and identical emblems that appeared on squad cars and the Police Department's door.
The badge had been in use for 11 of the town's 137-year history.
The issue remains such a sore point that many Gettysburg residents, where Jones is one of four Black residents, declined to comment.
Pastor David Otten of the local Emmanuel Lutheran Church declined to address the conflict. He issued broad guidance: "When you post something on Facebook, are you building the person up or are you tearing them down? We're supposed to be building people up."
Quick backlash
"Everyone is sick and tired of seeing the statues and everything ripped down," Mikkelsen wrote in the Facebook group. "The removal of the Confederate patch on law enforcement was the straw that broke the camel's back. THIS IS WHERE 'WE THE PEOPLE' MAKE A STAND!"
Mikkelsen and others said town residents should have voted on the issue; the badge was introduced in 2009 by then-police Chief Gayle Kludt without a vote by the public.
Some people from town and across the state called out Floyd's criminal history. Others noted that he had fentanyl in his system when he died.
"60 days sober today!!!!! Congrats George Floyd!!!!!" said a post Bruce Kessler shared two months after Floyd's death.
Kessler, who owns Gator's Pizza in Pierre, declined to comment.
The posts are emblematic of the country's new "overt racial consciousness" that is divided between social justice efforts and resurging white nationalism, said Enid Logan, associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota and associate chairwoman of the department.
Logan, who reviewed the posts, attributed the polarization in part to backlash against Obama's presidency. The badge was introduced the year Obama was first inaugurated as president. Kludt said the events were coincidental.
"A lot of this … discourse has clearly been inflamed and encouraged by Donald Trump," Logan said, adding that such beliefs gained "a new sort of legitimacy" under him.
On Aug. 23, Edward Flad Sr. shared a post that said, "We are the silent majority. … We believe all lives matter because that is what we learned from reading the Bible."
Two days later, his brother, Scott Flad, shared a post: "Does anyone buy this BLM Black oppression [expletive]?"
The Flad brothers defended the Facebook group during an interview in mid-September.
"Everybody's got the right to their own opinion," said Edward Flad, 56, who lives just outside Gettysburg. "If [Jones] would apologize for causing such a ruckus, I wouldn't have a problem."
"If anybody knew us, whether we threw that rally down in the park with the Confederate flag … we are the least racist people," said Scott Flad, 53, who lives in town.
The Facebook activity transported Jones to his childhood in the South.
"I realized that I was still a boy in certain people's eyes, you know?" Jones said, referring to a derogatory term used against Black men. "It's a lot disheartening, but it's nothing that I honestly didn't know."
Civil War heritage
Mikkelsen and the Flad brothers said the Confederate flag is part of the country's and town's history -- that Union and Confederate soldiers settled Gettysburg. The story is repeated on the city's website.
Historical records show otherwise. Two Gettysburg residents published a book in 1993 identifying one Confederate and 180 Union settlers for the entire county.
Kludt said that when she became police chief in 2009, she worked with a designer from South Carolina to craft a new badge that would reflect local history. There was no ill intent, she added.
Asked if the flag was a symbol of racism, she paused: "To me, no. To others, yes, and I respect friends of mine who have experienced racism and if they believe it's offensive to them, it is offensive."
Mikkelsen rejects white supremacist and alt-right labels. He didn't own a Confederate flag and knew little about it until the badge debate.
"I have no heritage in the flag, no nothing, and I didn't know much about it," he said.
Angered with Jones' influence, Mikkelsen researched the flag and bought three of them. He draped one across a window in his RV. He tows another around Pierre with his motorcycle.
"Just because a group of people say something's racist don't mean it's racist," he said.
For all the pushback, there is also support.
Pierre resident Bree Oatman helped organize a counter-rally in Gettysburg to support Jones and Mogard the same day as Mikkelsen's rally. Oatman and Pierre native Clark Stone, who lives in California, monitored the Facebook group and reported posts until they were kicked out.
"If I just sit back and not say anything, then I'm basically condoning the racism and the violence," Oatman said, "and that's not OK."
Pierre resident Joshua Penrod organized the city's first BLM rally in September. (A peaceful protest was held there in June.)
It's proof to Jones that his nephew's death wasn't in vain. He's met with demonstrators and civil rights leaders across the country. Jones and his sister, Angela Harrelson, have more than 200 virtual speaking engagements scheduled with colleges and universities to talk about race.
"Sometimes I sit back and I think, 'Where am I at?,' you know? 'Where am I living?' " Jones said. "And reality is my nephew got murdered in the middle of the street over a supposedly [fake] 20 dollar bill … but it was enough to change the whole entire world and to maybe make the world a better place."

Chauvin allowed to leave state for safety: Judge says he can go to any bordering state.

Full text: Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has permission to leave Minnesota for any of four bordering states for his own safety following his release from jail, a judge ordered.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over the trial of Chauvin on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the death of George Floyd, modified his release conditions Thursday without a public hearing, citing unspecified safety concerns that were presented to him in secret. Until Wednesday, Chauvin was held at a state prison in Oak Park Heights but was released after posting bail on a $1 million bond. Initially, the conditions of his release barred him from leaving the state.
Cahill's order, made public Friday morning, says Chauvin will be listed as having no permanent address but could reside in an adjacent state providing he keeps a cellphone with him at all times and stays in touch with the Department of Corrections and other state authorities. It says Chauvin's whereabouts will be restricted on a "need-to-know basis."
Chauvin and his wife, Kellie Chauvin, who has filed for divorce, previously owned a home in Oakdale, but they sold it in August. He has relatives in Iowa.
In the days after Floyd's death, the Oakdale home was the site of days of protests, part of widespread unrest that resulted in substantial destruction, including the burning of the Third Precinct police headquarters in south Minneapolis, where Chauvin and the three other officers accused in Floyd's death were stationed.
Chauvin's release prompted Gov. Tim Walz to activate 100 National Guard members in anticipation of violent protests.
On Wednesday and Thursday, hundreds of people marched down the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul, calling Chauvin's release pending trial another example of inequality in the justice system.
It is unclear who paid for Chauvin's bail. Court documents show his $1 million conditional bond was secured through A-Affordable Bail Bonds of Brainerd, Minn. Under Minnesota law, bond companies are not required to disclose who secured the bond or how much was paid in advance. A man who answered the phone at A-Affordable would not even confirm his agency posted for Chauvin.
Chauvin was the last of four former officers involved in Floyd's death to be released pending trial, which is scheduled to begin March 8 in Hennepin County District Court. Each of the other former officers, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, is charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All four have filed motions to dismiss the charges against them.
Last week, Kueng attorney Thomas Plunkett filed a memorandum in support of his earlier motion to move the trial out of the Twin Cities, saying "violent rioters" threatened the defendants and attorneys as they walked from the courthouse after a hearing last month. All four defendants were in attendance.
Floyd died following his arrest on suspicion of passing counterfeit bills at a Cup Foods convenience store in south Minneapolis. The medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, at least partly because of the police apprehension and restraint methods.
The killing, captured on a bystander's cellphone video, went viral on the internet, prompting worldwide outrage and civil unrest in Minnesota and across the country.

Mpls. police could be left 'one-dimensional': Budget discussion draws residents weary of crime.

Full text: Budget cuts and staff shortages will make the Minneapolis Police Department "one-dimensional," with fewer detectives to crack patterns of crime, Chief Medaria Arradondo warned council members Thursday.
Facing a potential $14 million cut, Arradondo said the department will have to shift its resources to officers who respond to 911 calls and investigate crimes. That means other, proactive work will be scaled back, the chief said during a public budget meeting.
"It's really something I would rather not do," Arradondo said.
Hours after they discussed the cuts to the Police Department, a City Council committee signed off on a $110,000 plan to hire two more workers, and potentially a contractor, to solicit public input as they seek to overhaul public safety in the city.
The Minneapolis Police Department has found itself in a precarious situation since George Floyd's death, with some residents calling on city leaders to end the department and others calling on them to increase resources there amid a spike in violent crime.
At the same time city leaders are debating how to change the department, they are also dealing with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, which will lead to budget cuts in nearly every city department.
A final vote on the budget will likely come in December, after the council negotiates changes with Mayor Jacob Frey. A budget plan Frey proposed earlier this year calls for roughly $1.5 billion in spending for 2021, about $179 million of which would go to the Police Department.
In a presentation Thursday morning, Arradondo outlined in new detail how initial proposed changes would affect his department. Because of the budget cuts and an unprecedented wave of officer departures, the city anticipates the department will have 937 full-time employees in 2021, down from 1,083 budgeted in 2020. Those figures include both officers and civilians.
The employees who remain will likely work more overtime, which will have a "human and financial cost," Arradondo said, and residents should expect longer response times if the existing crime levels persist.
Of the remaining employees, the bulk of them -- 531, down from 604 budgeted in 2020 -- would be assigned to public safety services, meaning they would focus primarily on responding to 911 calls. The next largest group, 192 employees, down 34, would work on investigations and forensics. Arradondo said detectives will have to work as "generalists," following up on many types of crimes, rather than specializing in one, such as homicides or robberies. As a result, the chief said, investigators would have larger caseloads.
Council Member Steve Fletcher said he had concerns about cuts to investigations, noting it was the "place I'd be the least likely to cut."
"I'm concerned that we are cutting, but then at the same time, also making ourselves less effective for the money," said Fletcher, who represents part of downtown.
Council Member Lisa Goodman, who also represents downtown, called the chief's report "somewhat alarming."
"I don't feel that it's taking into account the crime and safety issues we have generally and what I'm hearing from my own constituents," she said, adding that she has heard from business owners who say their employees are scared to come to work and residents who have told her they're afraid to go outside.
Those concerns were echoed Thursday afternoon when several dozen people shared their thoughts with a council committee. The public comment period -- the council's first on safety issues since Floyd's death -- was scheduled after people demanded it.
One after another, speakers said that they had lost their sense of safety because they or their loved ones had been victims of crimes, ranging from break-ins to assaults to having shots fired into their homes.
Unlike at earlier hearings held by the Charter Commission, when people widely advocated for cuts to the Police Department, many of the people who spoke Thursday said they wanted more officers and more funding for the department.
George Saad, a 10th Ward resident, told council members he is an immigrant, a minority and a "child of war." He said he chose to live in Minneapolis because of its "rich diversity." But, with the recent spike in crime, he no longer feels safe walking or driving around. He places some blame on the City Council.
"Since the unjustified and unfortunate death of George Floyd, the City Council has engaged in rhetoric that has emboldened criminals, the proof of which is in the unprecedented spike in crime," Saad said, adding later: "You have endangered us, our homes and our businesses."
Some suggested their own alternatives, such as implementing an emergency 60-day plan, or bringing in officers from other locations to help on a part-time basis. Many said they wanted more clarity from the council on their plans for changing policing -- and whether they are willing to tweak or abandon them.
"I'm wondering: If this next year of community engagement and research for the new policing model does not show support for this, are you prepared to not move forward with this plan?" asked one speaker, Shannon McCormick.
A short while after the public comment period, the council's Public Health and Safety Committee signed off on a plan to boost community engagement efforts on public safety issues.
The plan would waive the hiring freeze to hire two more employees and city bidding rules to hire a contractor to help with other outreach efforts, such as translation services or graphic design.

Protesters out for second night

Full text: Protesters took to the streets for a second night Thursday to decry the release of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd on May 25.
The rallies -- one in St. Paul, one in Minneapolis -- came on the heels of a march Wednesday night in south Minneapolis that ended when 51 people were arrested near the Police Department's Fifth Precinct headquarters.
As of 10:15 p.m. Thursday, the rallies appeared to have wrapped up, and no one had been arrested. Most participants wore masks and appeared to be practicing social distancing.
At the St. Paul event, dubbed the Secret March, hundreds of people, including family members of Minnesotans killed by police, marched down University Avenue to the State Capitol.
The march was organized by the Justice Squad, Visual Black Justice, Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence and the 10K Foundation.
Former NBA player Royce White, a march organizer,said its message was "that the state has human lives, deaths, murders, on their hands, and this is a symbol of the state's authority here in Minnesota. And so we brought our sorrows and pains to their doorsteps to leave."
The marchers carried signs bearing the names of 100 people killed by police in Minnesota, along with five coffins and a sign that said, "Who will be next?"
"That's the feeling amongst the people right now," said White. "Obviously we are extremely dissatisfied with the decision to release Derek Chauvin on bond."
In Minneapolis, several hundred people gathered outside the Hennepin County Government Center for a protest organized by the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, Black Lives Matter Minnesota and other activist organizations.
Standing on the center's steps, speakers called for Chauvin to be taken back into custody as Aztec dancers from Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli circled two drum players.
The crowd chanted, "Say his name! George Floyd!" and "No justice, no peace!"
Chauvin shouldn't have been given the option of bail, the protesters said. They also decried the arrests of people involved in protests over Floyd's death over the past few months.
After the rally, the protesters marched around downtown Minneapolis, chanting, "Black power!" and "Native lives and trans lives, they matter here!"
Chauvin left Oak Park Heights prison Wednesday after posting bail on a $1 million bond. In anticipation of unrest, Gov. Tim Walz activated the Minnesota National Guard and mobilized 100 State Patrol troopers and 75 Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officers to help local law enforcement.
Chauvin, who has been fired, was initially booked into the Ramsey County jail after being charged and then moved to the state prison. He is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
On Wednesday evening, about 300 people marched from the site where Floyd died a few blocks north and then back. Some of the marchers made their way to the Fifth Precinct, where many of the 51 arrests took place.
Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said 49 of the arrests were for misdemeanor offenses. The Hennepin County jail log showed many were cited for unlawful assembly. One person was arrested for fourth-degree assault and one other on a felony warrant.
The state Department of Public Safety said 24 of the overall arrests were made by the State Patrol and another 10 by DNR officers.

Full text: Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murdering George Floyd on Memorial Day, posted bail on a $1 million bond Wednesday and was released from the state prison where he was being held pending trial.
In response, Gov. Tim Walz announced Wednesday afternoon that he was activating the Minnesota National Guard and mobilizing 100 state troopers and 75 conservation officers to help local law enforcement.
"Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of Minnesotans, we have asked the Minnesota National Guard to prepare to assist in keeping the peace," Walz said in a statement.
It said the mobilization was requested by the city of Minneapolis to allay public safety concerns regarding Chauvin's release from custody. The Guard is mobilizing 100 soldiers and providing equipment and facilities needed to support public safety.
Chauvin was released at 11:22 a.m., the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said.
neapolis to protest Chauvin's release.
Chauvin was released at 11:22 a.m., the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said.
Chauvin was initially booked into the Ramsey County jail after he was charged in Floyd's May 25 death and then moved to the state prison at Oak Park Heights for security reasons.
He is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe.
It's unclear how Chauvin afforded the noncash bail, which was backed by a New Jersey-based bail insurer. Financial information tied to bond and bail postings isn't public.
A bail fundraising effort on GiveSendGo, a Christian crowdfunding site, reported 37 donations totaling $4,198 as of Wednesday; its goal is $125,000.
"Chauvin has excellent legal representation but it's extremely difficult to mount a full & vigorous defense when you can only meet with your attorney once a day for only two hours," said the fundraiser description. "As importantly, Chauvin deserves to be with his family and friends."
The effort was organized by Chauvin's family, according to the site. The information could not be independently verified.
It's unclear where Chauvin is staying. According to Washington County property records, the Oakdale home he shared with his wife, Kellie Chauvin, who has filed for divorce, was sold Aug. 28 for $279,000.
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, did not return a message seeking comment.
"His release on bond is a painful reminder to George's family that we are still far from achieving justice," tweeted attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd's family in a federal civil rights lawsuit.
At a June court hearing for Chauvin, a judge set his bail at $1 million with conditions and $1.25 million without conditions.
The conditions include that he remain law abiding, have no contact with Floyd's family, not work in law enforcement or security, surrender any firearms and licenses to carry, and remain in Minnesota under court supervision.
Three of Chauvin's former colleagues who assisted with Floyd's arrest -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- each are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All three have been released on bond.
Trial is set for March 8.

Full text: The George Floyd mural at E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue South in south Minneapolis was defaced recently with red paint.
Surveillance video shows a man wearing shorts, a black vest and a black ski mask -- with a face mask over the ski mask -- walk up to the mural and spray it at 4:21 a.m. on Sunday, said T.J. Abumayyaleh, an employee at Cup Foods.
This is the second time that the mural has been damaged. A former medical student at the University of Minnesota admitted to the Reformer, a local online news site, that he was the person seen in surveillance footage one night in August defacing the Floyd mural with black spray paint. The 26-year-old man claimed he was drunk at the time and apologized; he's no longer enrolled at the U.
The mural has not been repaired after either incident.
The city has made plans for a permanent memorial to Floyd at the intersection where he was killed May 25.

Meet the alt press: With immersive, on-the-ground coverage of protest movements, Unicorn Riot adds an alternative perspective.

Full text: Niko Georgiades, like so many youths, wanted to be a pro athlete when he grew up. If not that, a sportscaster, he thought, narrating jump shots and three-pointers while practicing basketball at his home near Albert Lea.
Instead, at 38, Georgiades provides play-by-play of a different sort, while livestreaming protest marches, sit-ins, mass evictions and civil unrest for Unicorn Riot, an alternative media group he co-founded.
In late August, three short months after George Floyd was killed, he was filming the unrest in downtown Minneapolis spurred by rumor that a Black man -- yet another Black man -- had been unjustly killed by police. "People are rummaging through many stores down here," he said, describing the scene to thousands of viewers watching his continuous, first-person video via social media.
The tall, bearded Georgiades framed his shot on a large broken window of Saks Off 5th as police shoved intruders back onto the street. "They're pushing people, Why, dude?" he hollered to the police. "They do not practice de-escalation," he said of the officers' actions.
Georgiades filmed police arresting people. He panned his camera across several storefronts, reading the fresh graffiti ("keep looting" "more dead cops"). He offered the mic to passersby. He sneezed his way through a cloud of chemical irritant, revealing the visceral realities of boots-on-the-ground reporting.
"The anger is palpable," Georgiades said, describing the mood of the crowd. Then he dodged a projectile law enforcement shot his way. "Getting hit from those marking rounds does not feel good," he added.
In the five years since Unicorn Riot incorporated as a nonprofit in Minneapolis, the organization has drawn praise from journalistic institutions as lofty as the New Yorker for its thorough, intimate coverage of social and environmental conflicts, while also spurring some controversy.
In 2015, Unicorn Riot exhaustively livestreamed the 18-day occupation of the Minneapolis Police Department's Fourth Precinct following the death of Jamar Clark, who was killed by police. A year later, several Unicorn Riot reporters spent months embedded with opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline project, camping alongside them in blizzards and getting arrested in the process.
But it was the media collective's coverage of the unrest following Floyd's May 25 death, at the hands of Minneapolis police, that brought a surge of attention. Suddenly Unicorn Riot's feeds were being watched by people across the Twin Cities, and well beyond, who wanted an immediate, uninterrupted view from the front line.
Born of discontent
Georgiades talks the way a lot of people talk, using vocabulary and elocutions you'd be hard-pressed to hear on a mainstream news broadcast. Colleagues are "cats," something unjust is "super whack," someone out of control is "off the chain," and "police" is pronounced with a long, drawn-out "o." Which is to say, he doesn't present the traditional demeanor of the hyper-groomed, helmet-haired TV reporter.
Georgiades also doesn't have the same background as most mainstream journalists.
At age 12, he broke his neck playing basketball, and losing his athletic identity sent Georgiades into a tailspin. He started acting out, got arrested, and cycled in and out of various juvenile detention centers for the remainder of his teenage years. "My life was up in turmoil," he said. "But there's a lot I learned -- I wouldn't take back anything."
In his early 20s, Georgiades got a fresh start. His girlfriend (now ex-wife) connected him to a job as a van driver with the We Win Institute, a Minneapolis nonprofit that supports underprivileged youth, where he has worked, in various roles, ever since.
Around that time, Georgiades became involved with various social-justice movements, including those protesting police killings and the FBI's raiding of Midwestern antiwar activists' homes, as well as Occupy. He first picked up a camera in 2008 when the Republican National Convention came to St. Paul, just to film the protests for himself.
Georgiades started freelancing for online independent media outlets, including the grassroots collective Indymedia, filming protests of the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago and those surrounding Michael Brown's killing by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer. But Georgiades soon became frustrated with lack of control in how his work was published, and he began meeting with a small group of like-minded independent journalists.
The collective became Unicorn Riot, an educational nonprofit funded by grants and donations. Its members, who lived in cities across the country, would operate with a horizontal structure, make decisions via consensus, and offer their footage free for noncommercial use. Their mission was to bring to the surface the underlying causes of social and environmental issues while amplifying often marginalized perspectives. "We are a platform that was created for the community," Georgiades explained. "Mostly for the people who don't have a voice in the mainstream media."
A unique niche
While Unicorn Riot may be best known for its livestreams, the collective also produces edited videos, documentaries, articles and investigations. It reports on a wide range of issues, from homelessness to climate change to white supremacist groups, posting videos and stories several times a week.
Georgiades and another local member, Georgia Fort, are at work on a long-form project about the families of people who have been killed by police.
Though Unicorn Riot's most dramatic work gets the most eyeballs (Georgiades' livestreamed footage from inside Minneapolis' burning Third Precinct, following Floyd's death, drew nearly 2 million views), much of its coverage involves patiently gathering the perspectives, grievances and motivations of protesters demanding change.
Over the years, the organization's size has ebbed and flowed. It currently has eight members, many of whom also work day jobs, based in Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Washington, D.C., and South Africa. (Georgiades is the only remaining co-founder in Minneapolis.) Members don't have prescribed roles and instead share duties of filming, editing and writing as well as production and administrative tasks.
Jenn Schreiter, who joined Unicorn Riot shortly after its founding, calls it a "leaderful" organization, because everyone takes responsibility for guiding coverage. What Georgiades brings to the group, she said, is being driven, organized and "deeply concerned about other people's freedom."
Early on, Unicorn Riot struggled to find an audience, and members basically volunteered their time for the first two or three years. "We were lucky to have 30 people watch," Georgiades said of a weekly live show he co-hosted. "We would get super excited if we got a $5 donation." After the group's anniversary fundraiser this March, it had only a few thousand dollars in the bank.
But coverage of the Floyd-related unrest sent viewership soaring, along with donations. In recent months Georgiades said Unicorn Riot has pulled in more than a million dollars, a sum he calls "amazing but frightening," that will allow the group to sustain itself and grow.
A place in the media landscape
It's easy to see how Unicorn Riot's coverage looks different from the major television networks.
During the late-August unrest, Georgiades' livestream had the gutsy, first-person feel of a GoPro action camera compared with TV's omniscient helicopter shots. He broadcast unedited interviews instead of condensing them to clipped sound bites. When the Twin Cities' three major television stations simultaneously aired Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's news conference, Georgiades stuck to the streets, streaming for hours without interruption for weather reports or commercials.
But defining precisely where Unicorn Riot sits on the media landscape is more complicated.
Journalists aren't as easy to distinguish from the general public as they once were, now that anyone with a smartphone and a social media account can document and publish news. In the United States, journalists aren't licensed, nor must they abide by a universal code of ethics.
Unicorn Riot has been referred to as "activist journalists" or "citizen journalists," vague terms that cause Georgiades to bristle at the dismissive connotations. (He admits that while the name Unicorn Riot, chosen on a bit of a lark, is certainly memorable, it also can be polarizing.)
While Unicorn Riot's work fits the basic definition of journalism -- collecting and presenting news -- its reporters have crossed lines that most mainstream news outlets would prohibit. For example, Georgiades captured dramatic footage inside the Third Precinct by trespassing.
He and the other Unicorn Riot reporters also tend to avoid filming the faces of protesters engaged in criminal activity, knowing that law enforcement could use the footage to implicate them. And the group has used the word "murder" to describe George Floyd's death, a term other news media would refrain from using without a criminal conviction.
Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law in the University of Minnesota's journalism school, said she appreciates how Unicorn Riot covers stories that don't get the attention they deserve. But she said the reporters' decision to shield protesters engaged in lawbreaking creates an edited narrative that benefits one group.
This approach conflicts with the journalistic fundamental of maintaining an independent perspective, and neutrally capturing what happens, she said. "It's not what I would consider to be journalism," Kirtley said.
But longtime Unicorn Riot member Schreiter argues that the choice not to identify people who may be breaking the law isn't necessarily distorting the truth. "I think our responsibility is actually to document what's happening without exposing our subjects to unnecessary additional risk," she said.
Georgiades said that any favoritism Unicorn Riot may show protesters is a response to the preferential treatment he said mainstream media gives the police, and that Unicorn Riot can be an equalizing force in an unbalanced power dynamic.
"If the corporate media is biased toward the police and the state-run narrative, Unicorn Riot is biased toward the community narrative," he said, citing the initial misinformation about George Floyd's death, disseminated by the Minneapolis Police Department and reported by mainstream media, as an example.
Fort, who joined Unicorn Riot about two years ago, said that when she worked as a reporter/anchor for commercial television stations in Georgia and Duluth, she saw police subjected to less scrutiny than community sources. In one story Fort reported, she said that the criminal history of a man shot by police made the five o'clock news while complaints filed against the officer were omitted.
This reflects what Danielle Kilgo, an assistant professor in the University of Minnesota's journalism school, has found in her research on protest coverage, that mainstream media has not been neutral, especially when it comes to anti-racism issues. Mainstream coverage tends to pay more attention to sensational aspects of protests vs. the substance, she said, focusing on the spectacle or disruption protesters are causing instead of the change they seek.
Kilgo notes how Unicorn Riot's coverage doesn't prioritize "official" sources and considers the citizens most immersed in a situation as those closest to its truth. "Because it is raw and unfiltered, it does have a different feel and a different vibe than perhaps mainstream journalists would be willing to produce," she said.
That's why you might see a Unicorn Riot reporter give a hug or high-five to a source after an interview -- something many mainstream news organizations would not construe as impartial. But Kilgo suggests that ethical boundary doesn't account for different social norms, that a reporter high-fiving a protester can simply be a polite sign of respect, street culture's equivalent to saying to a government official, "Thanks for your time."
While neither alternative nor mainstream press is perfect, Kilgo said, they should be seen as complementary. "We need both to be able to get to the heart of this representation," she said.
Regardless of how, exactly, Unicorn Riot is defined, there's a growing appetite for its work -- an appreciation of which is occasionally caught on camera.
"Niko, we love you," a man shouted into a megaphone during Minneapolis' late-August unrest. "Thank you for being here."

Keeping Floyd's spirit alive: Art reflects the moment in four exhibits at Minnesota African American Heritage Museum.

Full text: Tina Burnside doesn't want people to think that George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police was an isolated incident. Co-founder of the Minnesota African American Heritage Museum and Gallery, she sees it as part of Minnesota's history of systemic racism.
"A lot of people were surprised by George Floyd's killing, and we want people to know it didn't happen in a vacuum," said Burnside, a journalist-turned-attorney. "Even though Minnesota has this history of being a progressive state, there is a lot of racial discrimination and disparity that has happened to African Americans."
Burnside worked with co-founder Coventry Cowens, volunteers and community members to organize a series of exhibitions that resonate with this historical moment. The Minneapolis museum reopened Aug. 18
with four exhibits, each filled with artwork inspired by the movement, documenting it and reflecting on its history. "As time goes on, people will forget George Floyd or people will forget about what happened or people will have fatigue," said Burnside. "We want the energy to stay so that people can continue fighting for racial justice."
Located in a corner gallery on the fourth floor of the former Thor Construction building, now known as the Regional Acceleration Center, at Plymouth and Penn avenues N., the volunteer-run museum turned two years old in September.
Floor-to-ceiling windows bring in natural light. Because of the pandemic, chairs are gone and museum-goers must take a one-way, clockwise route through the gallery. Visitors get a temperature check and must wear masks.
The exhibition "A Reckoning: 100 Years After the Lynchings in Duluth," a collaboration with St. Paul-based publishing company In Black Ink, commemorates the events of June 15, 1920, nearly to the day of George Floyd's killing this past summer, when an angry mob lynched three young Black men who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman.
On the wall, there is a nauseating photo of the murdered Black men, surrounded by a mob of white people, many of them smiling. The photo, which was turned into a souvenir postcard (something that was common at that time), might remind a viewer of the viral video showing a Minneapolis officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.
"When people share videos of people being killed, it triggers a lot of anger and hurt, but nobody would believe what was happening to Black people if it weren't for those videos," said Burnside.
The museum also has premiered a video collection called "Un-heard" offering responses to Floyd's killing from 11 performing artists working in dance, spoken word and music.
Queen Drea's "Black on Black Love" muses on its title through flowing, chill beats. In the passionate spoken-word piece "Hold On," Joe Davis speaks to the camera, calling for collective healing and liberation.
Alexis Camille's bitingly funny, stream-of-conscience video "Minnesota Nice and Racist," filmed at home with her dog in the midst of the uprising, offers a raw emotional take heightened by the pandemic ("There's an influx of hate and joy and violence and healing").
Hannah Hagen and Sandrine Sugi's spoken-word piece "B.L.A.C.K." intersperses facts about being Black in America ("one in three Black men at some point in their lives are likely to be sent to prison versus one in 17 white men. Did you know?") with empowering and affirming words ("My Black brothers and sisters: You are important. You are needed. You are powerful beyond measure.").
Patrons can watch in the gallery or on the museum's YouTube page.
Don't fade
Elsewhere at the museum, "Gather in His Name: From Protests to Healing for George Floyd" is a compilation of photographer John Steitz's portraits from the unrest following Floyd's death. And a video by nonprofit media organization Unicorn Riot documents the first day of protests.
In the hallway facing the gallery, there's a bird's-eye photograph, shot by a drone, of a museum-sponsored mural on Plymouth Avenue that spells out "Black Lives Matter." The letter "I," painted by Donna Ray, includes a hawk symbolizing Floyd. She sees the hawk as a messenger bird for the spirit world.
"I do believe that we do come back as birds, and when we meet an untimely death we come back as a higher bird, like a hawk," she said in a video documenting the making of the mural, available on the museum's YouTube page.
The mural is still visible outside the museum, and though it's faded since mid-July, the video makes it feel fresh.
To keep that spirit alive, the museum is collaborating with Save the Boards to Memorialize the Movement to preserve plywood murals that once covered storefront windows. Volunteers can register online (tinyurl.com/y85j294p) and then show up at the Northrup King Building on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. to move the boards. (They will be part of an outdoor exhibition in south Minneapolis next year.)
"We need to document history as the events unfold because I think that has a greater impact," said Burnside. "We want to keep the movement going."

BURNED BY RIOTS, TAPPED BY GOP

Author: Rao, Maya

Full text: Korboi Balla was honored when Donald Trump's staff invited him to join the president for a rally at MSP Airport this summer to speak about how rioters burned down his Minneapolis sports bar.
But the Liberian immigrant also worried about backlash from the Black community, which overwhelmingly votes Democrat. Balla doesn't closely follow politics and is still undecided in the election. He just wanted to talk about what happened to his business. "A lot of people are going to take that the wrong way," Balla said he thought at the time. "People might look at it [as] he was just there because the president reached out to him to use him to be a Black face."
Some entrepreneurs of color who suffered losses from the riots after George Floyd's death are wrestling with the political implications of Trump using their stories to blame Democrats for permitting the chaos and trumpet himself as a leader who will restore law and order.
As the owner of a North Side barbershop that was ruined in the riots, Ray James objects to the Trump administration's denial of Gov. Tim Walz's request for federal aid to rebuild.
He's still undecided about who to vote for -- he finds Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden "shaky" in some areas -- but isn't happy about the president using business owners' stories about the riots in his campaign.
"I do not like that because you're using us as shiny objects to get people to vote when you don't care," said James, who is Black.
Flora Westbrooks, who is Black, lost the Minneapolis hair salon she owned since 1986 to rioters, months after she dropped her business insurance because she could no longer afford it.
Last week Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and Vice President Mike Pence visited the pile of rubble with her on West Broadway before gathering at the airport's Intercontinental Hotel for a "Cops for Trump" campaign event.
Lamenting the destruction of Westbrooks' business, Pence told the crowd, "We are going to have law and order in every city in every state in this country for every American of every race and creed and color ... which is quite a contrast to the other side." Westbrooks declined to tell the Star Tribune whom she is voting for.
"I don't feel used," said Westbrooks, who was contacted by the Trump campaign to participate after appearing in various media outlets. "I just want to get my word out there and I just want people to know who I am and what I stand for. It has nothing to do with Mr. Trump. [Ivanka Trump and Pence] didn't bring his name up to me at all."
To Westbrooks, the riots are a local issue. "I don't think it has anything to do with presidential politics."
After Fox News interviewed Westbrooks following the visit, donations rolled into her GoFundMe page from people around the country who said they saw her on TV. Some framed their contributions in political terms: "No one deserves to lose [their] business to these vandals. Trump 2020," posted one donor. "God bless you Flora and never give up! Vote for President Trump!" wrote another. "Wake up, Black America -- VOTE TRUMP," urged a contributor.
"Personally, I haven't heard enough from Biden and Kamala Harris during these tumultuous times," said Dina Payne, who works as an airport ticket agent and lives on the North Side. "I don't know if their strategy was to sit back and let Donald's clown show go on for a little bit and let him just expose himself without even needing any ignition from anybody else."
Payne was upset to lose some of the businesses she patronizes during the riots, including Cub Foods.
But as a Black woman, she cannot imagine voting for Trump. She went on Facebook to criticize the decision by Westbrooks to speak at the Trump event, accusing her of selling out for a president whom she believes does not care about Black people.
"To allow him to use you as a prop to try to further himself in an election where he has no agenda on helping further any [Black Americans] as far as the struggle, I just don't get it," said Payne.
The Biden campaign, which has condemned the riots, hosted a virtual roundtable in July that included Ruhel Islam, whose Gandhi Mahal restaurant was burned down in the riots.
"We deserve a president who will join with us, rather than one who comes to our state to further politicize the murder of George Floyd and try to pit us against one another," Islam said then.
The National Small Business Association found in a 2018 survey that more small-business owners identify as Republican than Democrat (38% vs. 28%), but the largest category is politically independent.
On Sunday afternoon, Hmong pop music played in Long Her's empty clothing store on University Avenue in St. Paul as he reflected on how first the pandemic, then the riots, destroyed his livelihood.
He showed a reporter letters threatening to shut off his power because he was behind on his bills, even after laying off his workers. Looters caused him $160,000 in losses.
Her said he agreed to speak at the "Cops for Trump" event at the invitation of the Republican congressional campaign of Sia Lo. Her backed Hillary Clinton in the last presidential election and is now considering a vote for Trump.
Her came here in 1980 as a Hmong refugee from Laos. Trump has criticized refugees and reduced refugee admissions to record lows, but Her said he isn't voting based on refugee policy.
"Trump supports law and order. ... Whoever is the new president, I need them to hire more police," said Her.
Balla said he's been racially profiled regularly as a Black man who drives nice cars.
He always makes sure to keep his documents current and his taillights working.
Balla ensures that he is polite to officers who pull him over and keeps his hands displayed in a "10 and 2" position on the steering wheel.
As rage exploded over Floyd's death under the knee of a cop, Balla and his family joined in protests calling for racial justice.
"I am a Black male living in America, so I was out there protesting about what had happened with the whole George Floyd and everything else," said Balla, a firefighter in Brooklyn Park. "So at the end of the day I'm all for [peaceful protests]. But when they come to burn down people's hard work that they have worked their butt off for to try to build something for their family, I'm not for that."
Balla said the Trump campaign reached out from day one after arsonists torched his Scores Sports Bar on Lake Street. Fox News reported in June that nearly two dozen Trump staffers donated to help Balla rebuild; among them was Trump's former campaign manager Brad Parscale, who tweeted a link to Balla's GoFundMe page. Contributions to the page now top $1.1 million.
After the campaign invited him to meet with Trump in August, Balla said he consulted his pastor and wife for advice. He concluded that meeting the president was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
"As Black men, we have to worry about the backlash in everything we do," said Balla. "If you meet up with the president, 'Oh, he's just another Black dude that's trying to be an Uncle Tom.' "
But he said that's not the case at all, explaining, "He invited me to talk about my story and my life and the whole world heard my story. It wasn't anything about any politics."
At the Aug. 17 rally, where Balla was among four riot-affected business owners to speak, Trump blamed local Democratic leadership for allowing the Twin Cities to burn.
Gemechis Merga, who spoke at the event, also blamed local Democratic officials for how they handled the unrest that severely damaged his auto shop.
"Say we have a gubernatorial election -- I wouldn't vote for the same governor," Merga, who is an Ethiopian immigrant, said in an interview with the Star Tribune. "I wouldn't vote for the same mayor. But the [presidential] election has nothing to do with Minneapolis. The general election is not going to change anything on the ground here."
He won't disclose how he's voting in the presidential race. He does, however, appreciate a politician showing interest.
"When the president of the United States talks to me about my problems, I feel a little bit better," said Merga. "I never heard from the mayor or any officials in the state of Minnesota. Nobody asked me what happened to me."
