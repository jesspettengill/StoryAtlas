Full text: For Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender, every day is now a high-stakes juggling act.
When she and her colleagues took the stage at Powderhorn Park and promised to abolish the Minneapolis Police Department following George Floyd's death, they captured the world's attention.
Now, nearly three months later, some people are waiting for council members to fulfill their promise of ending a department that disproportionately uses force on Black residents. Others are urging them to keep police during an especially violent summer. This, on top of a homelessness crisis spurring encampments, and yet another night of unrest last week that highlighted the fragility of the city's relationship with residents.
"I think we need to proceed with enormous humility as people who are in office at a time of extraordinary pain in our community," Bender said. "We're balancing that with the need to respond in a way that meets the moment."
To succeed, they'll need to win over residents and activists who say they've heard promises for change too many times in the past -- only to see them fail.
Inside her ward, people's views on policing and the council vary, and they're often nuanced.
John Meegan, who owns Top Shelf, which creates custom suits and shirts, said he wants the Police Department to change and racial profiling to end. He also wants violent crime to stop rising. Customers have told him they're scared to come to the city.
"I don't know what the city can do about it," he said, "but, again, I've seen no action, no activity and no addressing of issues like that."
Nothing has been the same since Memorial Day, when Minneapolis police killed Floyd, prompting protests around the world.
Bender was in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness with her two children and learned about his death in a text message and a voice mail from other city officials.
When fires and looting began in Minneapolis, she and her children paddled frantically against the wind for a full day, she recalled. They made it back four days after Floyd's death, and the days that followed were a flurry of activity.
When they slowed slightly, Bender and eight of her colleagues gathered in Powderhorn Park and made a bold promise to end the Minneapolis Police Department. While they acknowledged they didn't have all the answers about what a "police-free future" would look like, they promised to spend a year getting feedback. Their pledge was at odds with the policies backed by Mayor Jacob Frey, who favors changing the department instead of abolishing it.
While their stances differ, Frey said he has appreciated his relationship with Bender and their constant communication.
Looking back, Bender also describes the Powderhorn Park pledge, for her, as a compromise. Bender said she has had a long relationship with Reclaim the Block and the Black Visions Collective, which hosted the event. She said she declined to commit to cutting a specific amount from the police budget but agreed with the final pledge.
"Part of the thing that was difficult for me was having been out of town in those early days, I wasn't here ... wasn't doing the things I would normally do," she said, adding: "I think we were all working to respond to the moment, and the pain and anger in our community."
Shortly afterward, Bender appeared on CNN. She said the department wasn't working for everyone, and that defaulting to relying on police for emergencies "comes from a place of privilege."
"Of course, I wish I had said it differently now," Bender said. "But in Minneapolis, it is a privilege to feel like you can call 911, and it shouldn't be. Everyone should feel safe."
Since Floyd's death, she has spoken repeatedly about privilege and the need for white residents like her to work to end racism.
When people questioned the city's decision to release video of a man's suicide on Nicollet Mall this week, Bender tried to strike a middle ground. She sympathized with the desire to quell unrest amid false rumors that the man, a homicide suspect, was killed by police. But she said she supported the decision to remove the video from the city's social media channels, noting that watching a man kill himself could also be traumatic.
'We all need to do more'
A couple weeks after the announcement in the park, five council members unveiled a plan that would allow the city to replace the Minneapolis Police Department. Instead, it would have a new community safety department, in which police would be optional.
Bender joined as an author, saying she wanted to "signal my support" for her colleagues' work and that getting it quickly through procedural hurdles "would need leadership."
The council had just under two months to get its plan on the November ballot. Some praised it for quickly working to fulfill the pledge, while others accused it of violating the promise to spend a year talking to residents.
Bender's office was flooded with messages from people living both inside and outside of her ward, which includes the neighborhoods of East Harriet, ECCO, Lowry Hill East, South Uptown and Whittier.
Bender said she prioritized calls from her constituents while trusting her colleagues to represent their wards.
"I was elected by Ward 10," she said. "I wasn't elected by the city."
Nekima Levy Armstrong, founder of the Racial Justice Network, said she didn't feel Bender had done enough after previous police killings. Instead, she feels Bender placed a greater priority on bike lanes and "issues geared toward white people."
"It hasn't been the area of focus and so, for her as a white woman to stand in Powderhorn Park and make the declaration that she's going to disband the police without any real engagement with the Black community or the broader group of folks across the community, it's just unacceptable and unconscionable, and it is very poor leadership."
Bender said she has tried to push for equity in housing and transportation, top issues raised by her constituents. She said she hopes the city will boost its outreach efforts as police reform discussions continue.
"We all need to do more to make sure that our Police Department is functioning in a manner that keeps our community safe and doesn't continue to cause harm," she said. "We should have done more to prevent George Floyd's death, all of us, every single person at City Hall and, frankly, our whole Minneapolis community. We need to move forward in a way that acknowledges that we can't go back to normal."
Danny Schwartzman, who owns the Common Roots Caf, said he appreciates Bender's willingness to "confront the issues in a constructive way." Changing the Police Department is a complicated issue, he said, and some of the solutions also require work from other government entities.
"I think, for me, just because we don't have a plan that's ready to roll out doesn't mean we shouldn't be making progress," Schwartzman said. "The status quo isn't working."
Bender and other council members promised to keep working on police issues, aiming to get a question on the 2021 ballot. As the months pass, many will watch to see if the council's views shift.
In a letter to the Charter Commission this month, Bender and some of her colleagues said they "envision a public safety system that includes law enforcement."
Bender said she still envisions a future without police but doesn't see that happening quickly.
"To me that isn't by May or June, and I never meant that it was," Bender said. "And I never said that it was."

New on campus, juggling crises: New leaders at Bethel, Macalester, N. Hennepin face daunting semester.

Full text: Rolando Garc-a had yet to meet most of the students enrolled in North Hennepin Community College this fall, so the new college president loaded nearly a dozen "welcome bags" into his Kia Optima on a recent Wednesday and set out on a delivery route.
Donning a royal blue NHCC mask, Garc-a delivered tote bags filled with T-shirts, notebooks and "all kinds of North Hennepin swag" to new students' homes. He fielded questions about the school's fall classes -- about 90% of which are being taught online -- and assured parents that precautions will be taken to prevent students from contracting COVID-19.
"If going to their houses makes them feel comfortable, I'm more than willing to do that because they're giving so much to try and come to us and improve their lives," said Garc-a, who took over as North Hennepin Community College president July 1. Students are "yearning for that contact."
Garc-a and other newly appointed college presidents in Minnesota are taking the helm of their schools in the midst of a pandemic that threatens the sustainability of higher education institutions and on the heels of social unrest that rocked the state after the death of George Floyd. Instead of easing into their roles, these leaders are grappling with high-stakes decisions ranging from how best to reopen their campuses this fall to how they will respond to students testing positive for COVID-19.
Such decisions are at the forefront of college planning nationwide. An American Council on Education survey of 270 college presidents in early July found that safety was the most pressing concern for the fall semester, followed by enrollment, student mental health and the long-term viability of their institutions.
"New presidents are stepping into an unprecedented leadership moment for American higher education," said Philip Rogers, senior vice president at the American Council on Education. "The tolerance for ambiguity and the need for agility will be extraordinarily high."
Garc-a left his job as president of the south campus of Broward College in Pembroke Pines, Fla., to take the reins at North Hennepin. The Miami native and son of Cuban immigrants said he was drawn to the Brooklyn Park community college because of its diverse student population: 49% are students of color, 55% are first-generation college students and 31% are age 26 or older.
Coming from a state that was "on fire" with COVID-19 cases, Garc-a said he quickly got up to speed on North Hennepin's campus safety protocols and COVID-19 monitoring plan. His main mission for the fall is keeping students, staff and faculty safe and healthy by having mostly online classes, he said.
A mostly remote semester will have its challenges. Garc-a still needs to introduce himself to students, employees and stakeholders. He also must ensure students have access to critical resources such as food banks, counselors and the technology for distance learning.
"The data indicates that … it's going to be the underserved populations of students which will be left behind because they have issues with access to all those areas," Garc-a said.
Equity and safety needs
The need to address issues of inequity and racism was front of mind for Macalester College President Suzanne Rivera when she started her job June 1. Her first day came exactly one week after George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody, and just days after civil unrest led to nearly 1,500 Twin Cities businesses being damaged by vandalism, fire and looting.
A transition she once thought would be "extremely smooth" became "immensely more complicated." Rivera, Macalester's first female and Latina president, readjusted her priorities to focus her immediate efforts on addressing racism and safely reopening the campus.
Soon after Floyd's death, Macalester announced the creation of a scholarship fund to recruit and support more underrepresented students of color in Minnesota. A set of "bolder" racial justice initiatives is also in the works, Rivera said.
Last month, Rivera made her toughest decision yet. The start of the semester was just a few weeks away, and daily tallies of new COVID-19 cases were not dropping. She chose to scale back Macalester's reopening, starting the semester online and limiting the number of students who can live in dormitories. It was a departure from the school's original plan to hold two-thirds of its classes in a hybrid format, which includes a mix of online and in-person instruction.
Rivera leaned on her background in bioethics in making the decision. The ethical principle of "non-maleficence" -- minimizing harm -- guided her decision to take more precautions while still allowing first-year and transfer students to move into dormitories.
The principle of justice, which emphasizes fairness, informed Rivera's plan to test all students twice for COVID-19 without straining state resources. Macalester acquired swabs and other testing materials from an out-of-state vendor.
Rivera added that she also brings a "mother's heart" to these tough choices. Her daughter, a junior at Brown University in Providence, R.I., is facing similar uncertainty.
"Through her, I have a greater understanding of how challenging this whole situation has been for college-age students," Rivera said.
Financial considerations
Bethel University President Ross Allen, a former Medtronic executive, is taking a calculated approach to charting the private Christian college on a path to financial sustainability. His background at the medical device company involved working with distressed entities that were struggling financially.
Allen's job at Bethel is not so different. The Arden Hills school has long grappled with declining enrollment and budget cuts. In December, the school announced it would shutter some buildings, phase out academic programs with low enrollment and cut as many as 60 staff and faculty members to help tackle a projected $11 million budget shortfall over the next three years.
Allen, who took the helm May 1, said he is optimistic further deep cuts will not be needed. He plans to tap outside expertise to help Bethel become a more effective and efficient school. And he said he will look for ways to increase affordability, so more students consider Bethel as an option.
But the college's financial health will largely depend on how long the pandemic lasts, he said. Fall enrollment is down about 13% compared with last year.
The school welcomed students back to campus last week with a slew of virtual and in-person activities, including a socially distanced "movie on the lawn." The in-person experience is a focal point of Bethel's faith-driven campus community, Allen said. Even in a pandemic, "you've got to be clear who you are."
"We want people to be safe … but we also want them to be able to have the experience," he said.

Pence takes message from RNC to Duluth: The vice president spoke on jobs, tax cuts and gun rights.

Full text: DULUTH - Vice President Mike Pence visited Minnesota on Friday, bringing many of the same messages from the Republican National Convention to the politically divided region.
"We're going to make Minnesota more prosperous than ever before," Pence told a crowd of a few hundred outside a port warehouse in Duluth. "And we're going to make Minnesota safer than ever before."
As part of a two-state campaign swing, the vice president delivered a 50-minute speech that touched on religious freedom, tax cuts, gun rights and military spending. As at the convention, he emphasized the Trump administration's coronavirus response and law-and-order mantra.
But the focus of the event was written on large signs hung on the surrounding shipping containers: "Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!"
"Joe Biden wants to bury our economy under an avalanche of red tape," Pence said, adding: "I don't have to tell you here in Minnesota, Joe Biden and Barack Obama tried their best to shut down mining in the Iron Range."
DFL Chairman Ken Martin issued a statement before the rally, calling the Trump administration "a complete disaster for Minnesota families -- from its attacks on Social Security to trade wars that hurt our farmers to attempted rollbacks of the [Affordable Care Act] that would take away people's health insurance."
Martin said President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been disastrous and that "Minnesota families are still dealing with the fallout," with more than 70,000 Minnesotans infected by the virus, and tens of thousands suddenly out of work.
A mayor from the northeastern Minnesota region, Larry Cuffe Jr. of Virginia, joined the vice president to read a letter from him and other local leaders -- from Chisholm, Eveleth, Two Harbors, Babbitt and Ely -- endorsing Trump.
"Like many in our region, we have voted for Democrats over many decades," Cuffe read. "Today, we don't recognize the Democratic Party. It has been moved so far to the left it can no longer claim to be advocates of the working class."
Minnesota has become a prize eyed by Trump after he lost the state by 33,000 votes in 2016. Pence's visit came two weeks after the president went to Mankato to talk to farmers and small-business owners.
While Duluth itself remains a DFL bastion, the geographically large Eighth Congressional District that for decades sent Democrats to Congress has seen a Republican shift, with GOP U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber winning the seat in 2018.
Pence said he started in politics as the youth Democratic Party coordinator for his Indiana county in 1975. He said his grandfather, a lifelong Democrat who worked as a bus driver in Chicago, wouldn't recognize the party today. Many in the crowd may have similar stories, he said, trying to appeal across the partisan divide.
"Join us," he urged.
Nancy McReady wore a shirt that said: "We support mining and clean water. We CAN have both."
"And I just took off my 'recovering Democrat' button," said the longtime Ely resident, who said she became a Republican more than two decades ago after realizing her former party "kept taking more and more away."
McReady's husband retired from the mining industry after 40 years. Their house sits on a Boundary Waters lake.
"If you think I'm going to let it get polluted, you're crazy," she said. "But we need jobs. Our towns are dying. Our storefronts our closed. We need a resurgence of young people back into our community."
Scott Dane, an Iron Range logger who spoke at the Republican convention Wednesday, said Trump's work on tariffs and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has sparked needed change for the timber industry.
Before Pence arrived, about 100 protesters gathered in front of Duluth City Hall. Speakers focused on protecting the Postal Service and combating police violence.
Stauber's opponent, Quinn Nystrom, said her campaign is gaining momentum from the division the administration is bringing to the region. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, visited Duluth Pack, a local outdoor equipment store, last month.
Pence briefly mentioned two of the biggest issues facing the state and country. "We are on track to have the world's first coronavirus vaccine before the end of this year," Pence said, lauding Minnesota's "great health care tradition."
He also addressed the death of George Floyd at the hands of police: "There's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd in Minneapolis, and justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting and violence that has followed."

Full text: As they make decisions about how to protect the city during a summer of unrest, Minneapolis' elected leaders are trying to balance the concerns of residents who want a larger law enforcement presence to prevent rioting and looting against the pain that presence triggers in historically overpoliced communities.
Those concerns bubbled up during Friday's City Council meeting -- hours after the curfew was lifted -- as elected officials weighed a variety of public safety issues: how to respond after this week's unrest, whether to approve a temporary site for the Third Precinct that burned in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, and whether to start allowing more protective coverings over store windows.
Many of those decisions will require collaboration between Mayor Jacob Frey and the City Council.
Curfew came and went Friday morning with barely a hint of what erupted earlier in the week, when rioters targeted buildings up and down Nicollet Mall and block after block of sometimes fiery destruction resulting in more than 130 arrests. The return to relative calm prompted authorities to decide against implementing another curfew. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said law enforcement remained ready to respond in steady numbers if looting, violence and fires continued.
"We are not completely stepping that down, frankly. There will still be State Patrol on tap for this weekend; there will still be DNR and other state officers," Harrington said. Minneapolis and St. Paul also have their strike force teams ready to respond rapidly if crises emerge, he said, and other agencies are ready to help out as well.
Harrington said there were still about 100 arrests by all law enforcement agencies before the curfew expired at 6 a.m. Friday, 80 for curfew violations. Others were for weapons violations and narcotics. The National Guard, which was deployed Wednesday night, remained in Minneapolis on Friday.
In Minneapolis, the mayor can declare a state of emergency, which triggers the ability to institute a curfew. If the city wants that state of emergency to remain in effect for more than 72 hours, the City Council must ratify that.
Frey declared a temporary emergency Wednesday night after crowds gathered on Nicollet Mall following false social media reports that police had killed a Black man. The man shot and killed himself as police approached him in connection with a homicide.
That emergency would have expired Saturday night, but council members extended it to 8 a.m. Monday. Before they did, some members asked Frey to clarify the point of curfews used during unrest that has happened since Floyd's death.
Council Member Phillipe Cunningham, who represents part of the North Side, which has been hit particularly hard by a recent spike in violent crime, asked the mayor whether the point of a curfew was to protect people's safety or protect people's property.
"I just want to name, for the record, that it makes us feel a certain kind of way on the North Side when it feels that the property of downtown has a larger priority than our lives here in north Minneapolis," Cunningham said, adding that some people were shot during the curfew.
Frey said the purpose of a curfew is to protect people, prevent property damage and allow police to more easily distinguish peaceful protesters from arsonists and other destructive rioters. He asked Cunningham to clarify whether they wanted more law enforcement on the North Side.
"No," Cunningham said, adding later: "I just wanted to name that juxtaposition of experience."
Late Friday, four men were shot and wounded in north Minneapolis by suspects who fled, police said. The gunfire marked yet another outbreak of violence in Minneapolis, much of it unrelated to the unrest.
The council had been expected to vote Friday on a lease for a temporary site for the Third Precinct at 2633 Minnehaha Av. They decided to take more time to review that after Council Member Cam Gordon, who represents the area, said some residents raised concerns about their safety, noting the police stations have been focal points for protests and destruction. The precinct's headquarters on E. Lake Street was destroyed during unrest after Floyd's death.
"Probably, if this was a year ago, this wouldn't have raised the same concerns," Gordon said, "but everything about community safety has changed right now in the city of Minneapolis since the killing of George Floyd, and people are anxious to get involved and engaged and having the discussions about what the new community safety is."
Separately, Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins and Council Member Lisa Goodman said they are working on a proposal that would make it easier for business owners to place retractable coverings over windows.
Business owners have said they are frustrated by a city ordinance prohibiting exterior security shutters, noting that windows broken during unrest can cost thousands of dollars to replace.
"I do think this extraordinary time in our history calls for responsive flexibility from the City Council to be able to really relook at these ordinances that may or may not necessarily serve our community in the ways that we want them to now," Jenkins said.

Best Buy is hiring, and Diversity is job 1: The pledge is part of ramped-up efforts since George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis police custody

Full text: Best Buy plans on hiring more than 1,000 new tech employees in the next two years -- and 30% will be people of color or women.
"We are being incredibly intentional about our hiring decisions and how we approach each and every team to make sure it aligns with the communities in which we operate," said Mark Irvin, Best Buy's chief inclusion, diversity and talent officer, in an interview.
Executives at the Richfield-based electronics chain said the new hiring plan for positions such as engineers and product managers is one of several steps the company is taking to address disparities within the tech industry. They said the move also will result in better services and experiences for Best Buy customers.
Earlier this year, the company furloughed about 51,000 employees, the majority of whom were part-time workers. Best Buy has brought about two-thirds of them back to work.
Best Buy's technology team works on a range of tasks from working on the company's website and mobile app to creating the tools that employees use to troubleshoot for customers. Positions include user-experience designers, data scientists and digital engineers.
The company said its new hires will extend beyond the Twin Cities to also include remote, full-time opportunities in its technology offices in San Diego, Boston and Seattle.
Best Buy specifically wants to add more Black, Latino, Indigenous and female workers to its digital and technology ranks.
Nationally, people of color and women continue to be underrepresented in many science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) occupations.
Black and Hispanic workers make up 16% of STEM workers but 27% of the total workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. While women make
up half of all U.S. workers in STEM jobs, the percentage is lower in roles such as computer science and engineering.
In early June after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry wrote an open letter to customers, vowing that the electronics retailer would "do better" in addressing racial inequality.
"What do we do to change the cycle in which Black men or women, with tragic frequency, are harmed by those who are supposed to protect them? Or the gut-wrenching truth that to be a person of color in America is often to not feel fully safe, seen or heard?" she wrote in a company blog post. "For me, it starts with seeing the situation for what it is, acknowledging these experiences for what they are and, quite simply, apologizing for not doing enough. As important, it includes committing the company I lead down a path of systemic, permanent change in as many ways as we can find."
Best Buy has since formed an internal task force to look at ways the company can combat inequity.
As part of its commitment to diversity, Best Buy has announced a new $3 million scholarship fund in partnership with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) for Black students attending historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The company also has launched a scholarship for students attending the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.
Best Buy executives also said they hope the company will be able to recruit future workers through its network of Teen Tech Centers, which provide young people with hands-on experience in technology, training and mentorship.
The centers offer career programs that provide training for tech jobs as well as potential internship and entry-level jobs at Best Buy. The company has 35 centers across the country and has a goal of more than 100 centers.
The company also is developing additional programs to train those interested in technology with skills that can be used in careers at Best Buy.
"Our obsession is to create amazing customer experiences with technology, and we are only going to do that if we have the full diversity of our team behind that in a way that's aligned with the diversity of the population," said Brian Tilzer, Best Buy's chief digital and technology officer. "We can only create amazing experiences if we understand the breadth of the customers we are serving."
Strengthening digital capabilities will only become more important to Best Buy's strategy moving forward. Earlier this week, Best Buy reported its strongest online sales ever for a fiscal quarter. Best Buy's online comparable sales for the second quarter jumped 242% to $4.85 billion.
The company also announced it would experiment on with its mobile app with the use of augmented reality technology and a self-service, in-aisle checkout pilot.

Stunned Mpls. picks up pieces: Rumor fueled by lost trust quickly broke fragile peace

Full text: Not long before sundown Wednesday, word began to spread that a Black man had just been killed by police. At a Black Entrepreneur State Fair event in Father Hennepin Bluff Park, across the Mississippi River from downtown and barely a mile from where the death had taken place, a DJ announced that police were using a suicide story to cover it up.
A group marched across the Stone Arch Bridge to where the man died. Soon, hundreds gathered in downtown Minneapolis to protest what they believed was another fatal police shooting of a Black man only three months after George Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police. A replay of the last week of May felt imminent.
As protesters gathered, the Minneapolis Police Department sent out a tweet.
"*WARNING: This video contains graphic images*," the tweet read. "This evening, a murder suspect committed suicide as police approached them at 8th & Nicollet. No officer weapons were fired. This is a tragedy for our community that is still hurting."
The embedded video showed the police account to be correct: The man turned a gun on himself as police closed in, and as a group of bystanders scattered. Community activists worked to spread the word online and to the downtown crowd that this was not a police shooting and it wasn't a moment for protest. As the video of Floyd's killing inflamed May's uprising, it stood to reason that video of Wednesday's suicide could cool the night's heated emotions.
But that was not fully the case.
The tense and destructive evening underscored the distrust between the community and police. The gut reaction from plenty of protesters was simple: The police were lying.
"We know there is distrust now in certain parts of our community," Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said Thursday. "As soon as we started hearing the first rumblings that this was an officer-involved shooting, we needed to get that [suicide] information out. There would have been probably a lot greater destruction and chaos had we let that unsubstantiated ... rumor of an officer-involved shooting go."
And yet on Wednesday night, even as a man with a megaphone shouted, "We have the video -- the man killed himself!" emotions morphed into violence. A group looted a nearby Target. A man sat on the hood of a squad car, and two police officers shoved him off and sprayed him with mace, dousing several bystanders. Some tossed garbage cans to the street, and a few took the lids and smashed windows of businesses in IDS Center. They broke windows to Nordstrom Rack, climbed inside and then left with stolen merchandise.
"MPD did not kill him, but people assuming they did is rooted in a steep distrust," Minneapolis City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison tweeted Wednesday night. "Seeing windows broken and items stolen can be beyond frustrating, especially when all that rage was sparked (this time) by misinformation. But so often our policing institutions have themselves been the source of misinformation. We forfeited our goodwill and this is the ugly cost."
Late Wednesday, the Star Tribune and other news outlets published at least a portion of that video showing the moments before the suspect's death. Most news organizations, as well as Minneapolis police, later removed the video because of its graphic nature and as the immediate concerns about public safety eased.
Steve Floyd works with former gang members at the Agape Movement nonprofit in Minneapolis. About 8:30 p.m. Wednesday he took a group of the former gang members and headed downtown to de-escalate any violence. As the Foot Locker was being looted, people threw things at police. Floyd and his group stationed themselves between police and protesters and slowly pushed the crowd back. "If you got to vent, just vent -- don't be crazy," he told them.
"There's still a lot of pain from the George Floyd deal," said Floyd, who is not related to George Floyd. "Just the misunderstanding that they thought police shot somebody triggered anxiety. And then when police show up in riot gear and gloves on, it automatically escalates the mentality: 'OK, you all want to battle.' "
Brad Wright, a north Minneapolis native who now lives in Brooklyn Park, went downtown to find witnesses to the death and be certain it was suicide. Later, he stood in the smashed window of a breakfast joint and prevented looters from entering. More than protecting the business, it was about protecting the integrity of the movement that's gained momentum since Floyd's killing.
"It's a feeling of validation that we've finally gotten, and I didn't want that momentum to get sidetracked by something that wasn't true," Wright said. "So I stood in the window and yelled to the crowd, 'This is not what we do! This is not what we're standing for!' "
Wright and a group of 10 men from several churches patrolled parts of downtown until 1 a.m., shooing away looters who Wright assumed were simply opportunists.
For Wright, it was easy to see how people immediately believed the worst and assumed police were responsible: "We've seen things like this over and over in our community," he said. "It's not hard for us to believe that something like that would happen in broad daylight in front of everyone. The community does not have trust in the police right now."
City Council President Lisa Bender said she disagreed with the decision by city leaders to post the video on social media.
"I know the video was shared with the intention of transparency, but it is also a traumatic incident that was painful for people to see," she said. Its wide public display may have caused additional "trauma and harm."
But some activists believe that Wednesday's events would have spiraled out of control without the video.
"It would have been catastrophic" if there was no video, said state Sen. Jeff Hayden. "It shows you how much on edge people are, that even a rumor of police shooting a Black man is enough to infuriate people. I don't condone the behavior, but I understand it."
Or, as the Rev. Jerry McAfee of New Salem Missionary Baptist Church said Thursday afternoon, "If it was a cop killing, the city would still be burning."
"But the flip side is, without the video in the Floyd case, we might still be wondering what really happened," said Jim Hilbert, a former civil rights attorney and a law professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. "That's part of the reason we're seeing so much more energy and efforts for accountability.
"The last 10 or 15 years, we're all witnessing what used to be kept secret, the shocking brutality that's now caught on film," he said. "[Wednesday night] was about mistrust that's been built over decades of miscommunication and even misleading statements."
Some activists on Nicollet Mall encouraged people to see the nuances that help explain the situation.
When Kevin Reese, the director of criminal justice at Voices for Racial Justice, heard of Wednesday's violent death of another Black man, he made his way to Nicollet Mall.
The looting and property damage, he said, was unacceptable. It was also understandable, he said, an expression of raw hurt, anger and feelings of futility in the aftermath of Floyd's death.
"Take a half step back," he said. "It's rooted in real trauma."
Looting, he said, isn't about stealing; it's about lashing out at the power structure that otherwise won't let them in.
"What happened last night was deeper than disdain for the police," he continued. "Every day, in some formal or informal way, we are still seeing Black blood in the streets."

Stunned Mpls. picks up pieces: 2 cities on curfew, officers stationed to quell violence

Full text: Workers and volunteers in downtown Minneapolis swept up glass, boarded up buildings and assessed the emotional toll of another night in a summer of civil unrest Thursday after rioters damaged more than 40 buildings overnight, this time sparked by a false rumor that police had killed a man.
More than 1,000 uniformed personnel including 400 National Guard members and 250 State Patrol troopers stood ready to quell potential disturbances Thursday night as an 8 p.m. curfew fell upon both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Windows and doors on dozens of businesses and office buildings had been covered in plywood or otherwise barricaded for protection.
Well into the evening, Nicollet Mall remained peaceful with only a few people on the streets. A caravan of National Guard and law enforcement patrols traversed the corridor, warning over a loudspeaker that those who did not disperse would be arrested.
Authorities were vigilant about confronting stragglers and ordering them home, while volunteers with out reach organizations such as MAD DADS helped facilitate rides home by bus or vehicle. A Domino's pizza delivery driver called out to a stranger and her three young girls, offering the family a ride.
In Minneapolis, law enforcement arrested 30 people within the first hour, according to police spokesman John Elder. They seized one illegal gun. St. Paul had reported no arrests late Thursday.
The destruction, tension and law enforcement presence that began Wednesday night was reminiscent of the aftermath of George Floyd's death three months earlier -- in that case, the killing of a Black man at the hands of Minneapolis police spurring protests, both peaceful and violent, across the country.
Before curfew took effect, local and state leaders urged people to stay home Thursday night. Gov. Tim Walz said his concern was "safety and security and bringing peace into the city."
The unrest had erupted Wednesday evening after officers on Nicollet Mall approached a man implicated in a killing a few hours earlier in the day at a nearby parking ramp. Suspect Eddie Frank Sole Jr., 38, quickly ducked into a doorway and killed himself with a shot to his chin as bystanders scrambled for cover.
Crowds gathered quickly as rumors spread on social media that officers had killed him. Authorities almost immediately released footage from city cameras showing that the death of Sole, who was Black, was a suicide. But by then the destruction had begun.
Rioters broke windows downtown at retail stores, restaurants, bars and coffee shops including Chipotle, Caribou Coffee, Walgreens and Nordstrom Rack. Some businesses, such as Target, escaped with minor damage and reopened Thursday. A handful of suspicious fires had also been set, including some in south Minneapolis miles away from Nicollet Mall. Many businesses were already struggling financially from decreased shopping and eating out due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Local leaders called on people to restore peace Thursday by staying safely inside, acknowledging a need for continued work to end racial disparities.
"That conversation on equity, whether it's in our schools, in our health outcomes, has to happen," Walz said. "It cannot happen when violence is prevailing. It cannot happen when our cities do not feel safe. It cannot happen when our businesses are targeted."
Destroying the city would not create additional accountability, Mayor Jacob Frey said.
"The looting of businesses -- both small and large -- community-oriented businesses that have been the fabric of our neighborhoods for generations, does not lead to more accountability," he said. "We need to be exceedingly clear about that."
The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said earlier Thursday that 132 people had been arrested by multiple agencies in the overnight destruction that began Wednesday. Fire officials were investigating the apparent torching of four retail outlets that expanded the destruction well beyond the city's core. One fire was downtown at Brit's Pub at 1110 Nicollet Mall. Other fires broke out miles away at Tires Plus at 1103 W. Lake St., China Wok at 2800 S. 27th Ave., and Walgreens at 4323 S. Chicago Ave. Nobody was injured in the blazes, though crews rescued two residents from above the China Wok restaurant.
The rioting's effects stretched from 5th to 12th streets along Nicollet, then reached over to a Speedway and the neighboring Greenway Liquor Store and Lotus Restaurant near Loring Park. Caution tape surrounded the gas pump and gas station entrance.
"They took everything," a Speedway employee said, register and all. The retailer was closed and turning away customers trying to cross the tape.
Reactions to the destruction along the urban mall from commuters and residents on Thursday included anger, grief, frustration and thoughts of getting out.
A teary-eyed Diana Williams, hurrying to catch a bus for work, said the rioters are "making it hard for good working people who are trying to make their lives better. Since George Floyd died, people are acting crazy."
Michael Sanchez walked his dog down Nicollet past the damaged Target headquarters where he works. He said he and his wife began considering moving out of Loring Park a few months ago. They have a baby at home, and "we want to keep him out of harm's way," Sanchez said.
City Council Member Lisa Goodman, whose ward includes downtown and the Loring Park area, said Thursday that she's been hearing from other constituents who fear leaving their buildings. Goodman said these are people who "believe we need to end the systemic racism in the Police Department, and believe that Black lives matter, and who believe what happened last night was lawlessness."
Rick Alaric agreed the looting Wednesday was pointless. But he added that he's tired of Black people like him not being treated equally. "No Black people own these buildings," Alaric said.
The death of Floyd on May 25 while being restrained on the pavement by police in Minneapolis sparked days of rioting that left hundreds of properties torched, looted or otherwise damaged in the Twin Cities. Two deaths have been attributed to the unrest.
Floyd's killing became a national rallying point for protests across the world in a call for justice and racial equity.
Before heading to work early Thursday, Jerome Jackson, 60, perched under the Mary Tyler Moore statue on Nicollet Mall to listen to gospel music and survey the aftermath.
"Sad state of affairs," said Jackson, who said he had been a police officer in Louisiana. "Tearing up your own community won't result in anything. But a lot of people feel left out."

But how can anything feel normal, here in the city that killed George Floyd? Minneapolis went to bed to the sound of sirens and smashing glass and circling helicopters and woke to the sound of sirens and circling helicopters and hammers pounding plywood across shattered windows.
It has been 95 days since George Floyd died, and all that's changed is that we're angrier at one another.
As the curfew lifted at dawn, downtown business owners were out, sweeping up, tallying the damage and putting plywood into place with the speed of experience.
On Nicollet Mall, Roger was sweeping up glass in front of the shattered Britt's Pub. He'd filled 2 ½ large trash cans with broken glass and debris already and was planning to work his way the length of the mall, as long as it took. This is his city. He was born here and it's his job to look after Minneapolis now, as a street ambassador working for the Downtown Improvement District.
"This was all so unnecessary," he said, shaking his head at the damage to the pub, whose owners he said are always so kind, offering him water on hot days, chatting when business was slow. "Why can't young people take the energy they put into smashing stuff and use for something constructive? Even flipping burgers would be better than this."
Things had been quiet for the past few weeks. The chalk artists went to work for the socially distant Downtown Minneapolis Street Art Festival. Shops and restaurants were open downtown and people relaxed on rooftop patios and in outdoor dining areas that spilled out in the park. There were people playing shuffleboard in Loring Park the evening before the gunshot rang out on Nicollet Mall on Wednesday.
But underneath, the tension was building. Half of Black Minnesotans have lost work during the pandemic, compared with about a quarter of white Minnesotans. Around the country, the protests haven't stopped and the deaths haven't stopped.
Then, one state away, police shot a Black man seven times in the back in front of his children.
Then the same police force let a white teenager walk through police lines carrying the weapon he'd just used to gun down protesters on the streets of Kenosha.
And Wednesday, gunfire rang out on Nicollet Mall.
"I was sitting at the bus stop. I heard the shot," said Noel Santos, watching the cleanup from Peavey Plaza. "I saw about 100 people running by me. I was like, 'What? What?' People were going 'They're shooting people in the head!' So everybody ran."
The gunshot was self-inflicted, as police closed in on the man they suspected of killing another man in a downtown parking ramp.
But nobody believed the police, not after George Floyd. By the time the city tweeted out graphic surveillance footage of a death by suicide, it was too late to stop the angry people already in motion.
Last night was better than the unrest in the spring, Santos and his friends agreed. This time, he said, police responded fast.
One block, two smashed pubs and a Chipotle later, Roger had emptied his fourth bin of broken glass.
"This is our city," he said. "We need to act like it."

Ex-officer wants change of venue, dismissal: J. Alexander Kueng contends he did not knowingly help anyone commit a crime in death of George Floyd.

Full text: An attorney for one of the former Minneapolis police officers charged in the May 25 killing of George Floyd filed motions Thursday to dismiss the charges against his client, but if the trial proceeds, he wants it moved out of the metro.
Attorney Thomas Plunkett argued that prosecutors have publicly shared " 'potentially' prejudicial" evidence and that former officer J. Alexander Kueng did not aid or abet a criminal assault that led to Floyd's death.
Kueng and former officers Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are charged as accomplices to manslaughter and murder in the incident.
Former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
In his motion to dismiss the case against Kueng, Plunkett argued that the restraint Chauvin used was "reasonable" because it met training standards in a case where a suspect was actively resisting arrest. Even if the restraint of Floyd was an assault, Plunkett wrote, there's no evidence that Kueng knew Chauvin was going to commit a crime.
"Kueng could not intentionally aid and abet an act that he did not know was criminal," Plunkett said. "Chauvin was the senior officer and Kueng followed Chauvin's lead."
If the case does go to trial March 8 as scheduled, Plunkett wrote in a separate motion, it should be moved out of the seven-county metro area. He proposed Stearns County or another county with the "appropriate facilities and demographics."
Prosecutors have released evidence that could create a "reasonable likelihood" that a fair trial is impossible in the metro, Plunkett argued. Plunkett didn't cite the specific evidence, but noted that more than 1,700 local news articles have been published about the case.
Prosecutors have filed an audio and a video recording of interviews Lane and Thao gave to investigators in court, along with a motion. State law requires release of publicly filed evidence, and both recordings were released. Before that, Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, filed bodycam footage recorded by Lane and Kueng, resulting in their public release.
Thao's bodycam video was also released after a filing from his attorney, Robert Paule.
In the motion to dismiss the charges, Plunkett argued that Floyd refused to get into Kueng and Lane's squad car, that he stiffened up and fell to the ground and that Chauvin used reasonable techniques he had been trained in.
"Kueng had a minimal role in the incident," the motion said. "Kueng was merely present at Floyd's back."
Bodycam video showed that Kueng knelt on Floyd's back as he lay handcuffed on his stomach in the street. Lane restrained Floyd's legs off and on.
A judge will hear arguments about the motions and other outstanding motions at a Sept. 11 hearing.

Actions and reactions: NBA halts playoff games again but plans return; Twins, Tigers opt to not play ; Baldelli says team followed the right course

Full text: DETROIT - Rocco Baldelli listened as his players spoke, watched as they voted, and applauded as they walked out of Comerica Park. The Twins were unanimous in their determination to skip playing baseball for a day, in symbolic solidarity with their fellow pro athletes too appalled at the latest instance of excessive police violence against Black people to play sports -- and their manager couldn't have been prouder.
"It feels good. It doesn't feel good to ignore things that you know are wrong," Baldelli said after his players refused to take part in Thursday night's scheduled game with the Tigers. "The fact that we're even talking about these things means we're all moving in the direction that we should be moving in."
The entire organization quickly moved to back up their players' decision, releasing a statement that emphasized their commitment "to using our platforms to push for racial justice and equality. Therefore, we fully respect our players for their decision not to play tonight's game. … The recent shooting of Jacob Blake [in Kenosha, Wis.] a mere three months after the killing of George Floyd, shows again that real change is necessary and far overdue in our country, and it is our responsibility to continue playing a role in efforts to affect meaningful reform."
The game, one of seven postponed on Thursday by the growing protest, will be made up Friday as a doubleheader of seven-inning games, starting at 12:10 p.m. Coincidentally, Friday is Jackie Robinson Day around the major leagues, commemorating the Hall of Fame player who broke the racial barrier in baseball in 1947.
The Twins learned Wednesday that NBA and WNBA playoff games had been postponed, and several MLB games called off, too late to consider their own options before playing in Cleveland that night. But they discussed it on the flight to Detroit, and when they arrived at Comerica Park on Thursday, player representative Taylor Rogers called a team meeting.
Standing in the same room in which he and his teammates sprayed one another with champagne after clinching the AL Central title 11 months ago, Rogers stood up and said, "I don't believe we should play today," according to Baldelli.
Nelson Cruz and Trevor May also addressed the team in the midafternoon meeting.
"It was a very powerful gathering. The players were in solidarity in the decision," Baldelli said. "They ultimately, formally, raised their hands and unanimously voted not to play out of respect for all. I'm very proud of the way it was handled by our group, respectfully and thoroughly. A very powerful moment throughout baseball."
Including in the other clubhouse. As the Twins met, the Tigers held their own gathering on the home side, and the discussion grew emotional, according to Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire.
"Our players spoke out about what's going on in this country. [Cameron] Maybin stepped up and really spoke out deeply," Gardenhire said. "After going through that meeting, I didn't want to go out there. I listened to these guys talk with their heart, explaining what goes on in their lives every day, some of our young players. And I didn't feel like we should be playing baseball."
Not playing won't solve the country's racial problems, of course, but that doesn't mean that a night away from the baseball diamond, not to mention the Black Lives Matter T-shirts and the Justice for George Floyd tribute on the outfield wall, can't have an impact toward eradicating systemic racism, the Twins believe.
As May succinctly tweeted shortly after the vote, "Be an ally."
And, said Derek Falvey, the Twins' president of baseball operations, be an example, too.
"Your behavior matters. The way we go about our business on the field, we think, is something that players and young kids are watching at home and thinking about [or] they want to emulate. Maybe a younger child or another person is saying, 'Well, why? I want to learn a little bit more about why they made that decision not to play.' And maybe that's a way to make an impact, a small way," Falvey said.
"We're not saying that's going to solve all of these challenges. But if we have a chance to use our platform to potentially call attention to the why, and as a result, a few more people get educated by that and we can talk about it a little more and stand behind members of our community that are really hurt by some of what has transpired, not just in the last six months but for a long time, then I think that's our responsibility."

Downtown businesses clean up after night of riots, looting: It is the latest hit for Mpls. shops, restaurants hurt by the pandemic

Full text: The scraping of glass could be heard up and down Nicollet Mall as business owners and building managers began to clean up Thursday after a night of riots left a large swath of the shopping and dining thoroughfare vandalized.
While many downtown Minneapolis businesses sustained only minor damage -- some even able to reopen Thursday -- for others the damage is just the latest substantial setback they have had to overcome this year.
Brit's Pub was one of the most damaged businesses.
"Looters were stealing anything they could get their hands on from food, liquor, TVs, [point of sale] equipment and kitchen equipment," said Kam Talebi, owner of Brit's Pub. "The inside of the restaurant is completely trashed."
He vowed to rebuild.
The most significant sign of the Wednesday night rioting was boards being put up as broken glass was swept away all along Nicollet Mall, the main pedestrian and shopping thoroughfare in downtown.
The sudden violence resulted from false information about a suspect police were pursuing. The suspect died by suicide, but the crowd gathered, believing it was a police shooting.
The quick escalation and number of people involved in the destruction showed Minneapolis remains on a hair trigger three months after the police killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man. His death
sparked protests as well as violent riots and fires that damaged hundreds of businesses in Minneapolis and St. Paul -- many that were destroyed or are still in significant disrepair.
On Wednesday night, more than two dozen businesses reported property damage, including the headquarters building of Target Corp., national chains such as Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off 5th and small businesses like Brit's Pub and the Lotus Restaurant.
Brit's, at 11th Street and Nicollet, could be closed for months after damage from both looting and a fire that did significant damage to one end of the building.
Talebi, who bought the restaurant a year ago, said workers ushered customers out of the restaurant and patio around 8 p.m. after crowds and protests swelled.
He said there was no police presence as his bar was being destroyed.
He is uncertain about when he can reopen and concerned about the short-term future of the restaurant's 70 employees.
"It's disheartening with the financial hard times and the pandemic that they have to deal with this, too," he said. "I don't know what to tell them, but we will take care of our employees."
Restaurants and many of the stores were required to close in the spring as the state tried to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The unrest that followed Floyd's killing came just as they were able to reopen.
Haskell's Wine and Spirits on 9th Street had escaped damage or looting during the May riots. The windows then had been boarded up as a preventive measure. On Wednesday, though, the windows were smashed.
"At about 7:45 [after the store had closed] the staff heard pounding on the windows and the glass was breached, so the four employees in the store at the time kind of panicked and holed up in the beer cooler," said Ted Farrell, president of Haskell's. "Fortunately, a squad car pulled up within five minutes so everyone dispersed."
The store was closed Thursday for repairs to two large windows and the front door panels. It will reopen Friday with hours to be determined.
Yoom Nguyen, whose family owns the Lotus Vietnamese restaurant near Loring Park, voiced his frustration with the riot and posted pictures on Facebook of his family restaurant with its windows smashed in.
"Most of the damage that's done to small businesses like ours are fixed and paid for by the owners," he wrote.
The management of the IDS Center, the biggest building and central crossing of downtown Minneapolis, decided to open only to its commercial tenants on Thursday.
Nordstrom Rack and Hubert White stores both had windows smashed, as did the main entrance to the center.
"The [police] were getting us accurate and clear info so we could stay as safe as possible. I have nothing but good things to say about Minneapolis Police and how they handled this," said Deb Kolar, general manager of IDS, in an e-mail. "This is just like last time where pockets of [disorder] erupted here and there. They [the police] did everything they could do to stay on top of it last night."
Bob White, president of the 104-year-old menswear store Hubert White at IDS, said four of his windows were broken and had been boarded up.
"There were three of us in the store when it started, and we were watching it," White said.
The store was not looted, but he expected it would be closed the rest of the week.
Jim Durda, general manager of the City Center retail and office complex on Nicollet, said the most important thing was people's safety.
"It's really unfortunate. We had this loss of life yesterday, two lives lost," Durda said, referring to the man who shot himself and the homicide victim he was suspected of killing. "We are a big city with big-city problems and mental health issues, so there are broader issues to tackle."
In earlier unrest after Floyd's death, there was a lot more damage to the building. "This time it was only three windows at Starbucks and Saks [Off Fifth]," Durda said.
City Center -- and the Marshalls in it -- were open Thursday.
Minneapolis-based Target had several stores with significant damage in the May riots -- including the Lake Street store, which won't open for several months. On Wednesday, the Nicollet Mall flagship store was damaged and merchandise stolen; it was closed until noon Thursday for cleanup.
"Our first priority was keeping our team members and guests safe, and no one was injured in the building," the company said, in a Thursday morning statement.
The corporate headquarters at the corner of Nicollet and 10th Street also were damaged. External windows were smashed and a small group of people broke into the basement mailroom and started a fire, the company said.
Steve Cramer, chief executive of the Minneapolis Downtown Council, was out early Thursday to assess the damage. He called downtown businesses resilient.
"We'll bounce back from this," he said. "It's a tough blow, though. I think there's a lot of discouragement about this. On top of everything else that's happened this summer since Memorial Day and the killing of George Floyd, it really calls into question how we're going to come together as a community. That's the challenge we have in front of us right now."
While the worst damage was along Nicollet Mall, rioters also damaged an Avis and Budget car rental on South 10th Street and a Walgreens miles away on Chicago Avenue at E. 43rd Street.
Target stores in Uptown and Dinkytown also sustained minor damage, the company said.
The Lunds & Byerlys Wine & Spirits store on Harmon Place received minor damage and was closed Thursday. The main store was fine. However, hours at the three Minneapolis Lunds will be reduced through Saturday as a precaution, said spokesperson Katie Tomsche.
It still remains to be seen what the long-term impact to the unrest will be to downtown businesses moving forward.
Although he plans to reopen Brit's, Talebi said the government needs a plan to deal with violent acts.
"Downtown residents and businesspeople count on that leadership," he said. "I just hope they find a plan and get something in place to rebuild the city and bring safety back."

U.S. probe moves quickly in Floyd case

Full text: Spurred by intense public scrutiny and political pressure, federal authorities are moving faster in their investigation of possible criminal civil rights crimes in the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody than what has been customary in recent decades.
Less than three months after the Justice Department opened its own investigation into the four officers involved in Floyd's killing, a charging decision is likely to be handed up soon by a federal grand jury in Minnesota, according to sources with knowledge of the case.
Should charges result, the timing would be highly unusual in that such cases -- which are exceedingly rare -- are not typically filed until a state case concludes.
Current and former law enforcement officials say the pace of federal civil rights investigations accelerated after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., which sparked nationwide protests in 2014.
The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota began investigating Floyd's killing in police custody almost as soon as state criminal investigators did. The four former officers are being investigated under a federal criminal statute reserved for those who deprive others of their civil rights while acting in a law enforcement capacity. Dubbed "deprivation of rights under color of law" cases, the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison in cases that result in a death.
At the state level, Derek Chauvin is already facing charges of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. He was arrested after bystander videos showed him kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao
are each charged as accomplices. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office is leading the state's prosecution of the four former officers, scheduled to stand trial in March.
Chauvin remains in custody at the state prison in Oak Park Heights while the other three former officers are free on bond.
The grand jury investigating civil rights violations in Floyd's case could finish its work by the end of August, according to sources familiar with the federal investigation. They spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to talk openly about the case.
Meantime, defense attorneys have moved to dismiss the state charges against the officers. If the state's case does proceed to trial, it is expected to proceed before any possible federal trial.
The federal civil rights statute for abuse of authority is sometimes used in cases of excessive use of force by police. Such charges can also be brought against prison guards or when medical officials working for law enforcement refuse to administer aid.
The statute has traditionally been used as a backstop in cases where state prosecutions result in acquittal -- such as in the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles and the 2015 police shooting death of Walter Scott in South Carolina.
According to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, federal prosecutors brought just 49 "color of law" cases last year out of a total of more than 184,000 prosecutions nationwide. The Syracuse researchers found that such cases have been charged just 41 times a year on average in the past 20 years.
The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota declined to comment on the Floyd investigation. In a recent interview about color of law cases in general, FBI Supervisory Special Agent Mike Melcher, who oversees the unit that investigates civil rights cases, said such cases have a higher bar to clear because investigators must prove that those charged knew what they were doing was wrong yet did it anyway.
"The differences in what might be chargeable depend on a second-by-second analysis of those involved," Melcher said. "Our job is not to accept the narrative defined by a particular cut of video. We are neutral collectors of facts."
The process was highlighted last year during a meeting of a task force on deadly police encounters led by Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Ellison, months before the attorney general would be tapped to lead the state's prosecution of the officers charged in Floyd's killing.
First Assistant U.S. Attorney Anders Folk, in prepared remarks delivered during a panel discussion, explained that prosecutors could not win a conviction solely by showing that an officer made a mistake, "acted negligently, acted by accident or used bad judgment."
"Further, the law requires that the law enforcement officer's use of force be analyzed by a fact finder not with the benefit of hindsight, but rather from the perspective of a reasonable law enforcement officer on the scene," Folk said. He noted that investigators may consider the fact that officers "are often forced to make split-second judgments in circumstances that are tense and often involve life and death. … Indeed, it is a high standard of proof."
Even so, calls for the feds to step in after police killings of civilians have heightened since Brown's 2014 death in Ferguson, seen as a turning point in the traditional order of state-federal investigations and prosecutions.
"From my experience, since Ferguson, the call for federal investigations has increased as perceived trust in local authorities on a national level has decreased," said former U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger, whose office investigated the 2015 police shooting death of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis. "Whether that's warranted or not is a different story. And so you sort of hear people, as we did in Jamar Clark, you heard this outcry for a federal investigation, and almost immediately."
In the Clark case, the Justice Department, like the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, declined to bring charges, citing conflicting witness statements and evidence pointing to Clark not being handcuffed at the time of the shooting.
Richard Thornton, who was the special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis office at the time, said federal investigations probe deeper than state cases involving murder or assault charges. Thornton said agents are looking at how officers are trained, whether they were involved in similar incidents or used similar techniques before. Oftentimes these cases entail the review of compelling and emotional video evidence, like in Floyd's death.
"The video evidence is highly compelling; it's a huge part of the case," Thornton said. "But from a proving-willfulness standard it is certainly not the only thing that is important. You're trying to, in effect, get into the officer's mind. You're really dissecting them as a person and professionally throughout their career to look at all of those things that caused them to make the decision that they made."
In a video of Thao's voluntary interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) eight days after Floyd died, an FBI agent can be seen in the room. Robert Paule, Thao's attorney, told the agent that he had previously told Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Paulsen that he would not consent to questioning from the FBI during the BCA interview.
Paulsen, a veteran federal prosecutor, helped Ramsey County prosecutors try the murder case against former St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez, whom a jury acquitted in 2017 on murder charges. Yanez shot and killed Philando Castile during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights a year earlier. Paulsen has also helped prosecute and investigate cold-case killings, including the 1970 ambush killing of St. Paul police officer James Sackett, and he has handled a variety of major gang prosecutions.
Like the Clark probe, the federal investigation of Floyd's death is also relying on resources that include a separate autopsy performed by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner at the Department of Defense. According to court filings this month by state prosecutors in Hennepin County, the federal autopsy concluded that Floyd's death was caused by police actions and that the restraint used "had elements of positional and mechanical asphyxiation."
While federal civil rights prosecutions against law enforcement have been relatively rare, convictions in Minnesota on such charges are rarer still. Two of the three cases filed in the past decade resulted in acquittals.
In 2016, a federal jury acquitted Minneapolis police officer Michael Griffin of most of the charges against him, including violating the civil rights of four men in a pair of brawls in 2010 and 2011, respectively, outside nightclubs in Minneapolis. Jason Anderson, a member of the shuttered Metro Gang Strike Force, was also acquitted in 2010 of violating a Black teenager's civil rights by allegedly kicking him in the head.
However, St. Paul police officer Brett Palkowitsch is awaiting sentencing in October after being found guilty last year of deprivation of rights in connection with a 2016 incident in which he repeatedly kicked an innocent bystander in the chest, causing serious injuries, while a police K-9 mauled the man's leg. Frank Baker, an unarmed Black man, was left with seven broken ribs and collapsed lungs.
Robert Richman, a St. Louis Park defense attorney who represented Griffin in his trial, said the amount of video evidence -- between bystander cellphone videos and body-camera footage -- might also make the Floyd case different.
"Watching that George Floyd video, which is more than eight minutes long, as that guy pleads for his life, it's very difficult not to have a changed perspective about the police and at least be willing to accept the possibility that there can be bad eggs in the police force," Richman said.
The timing of an indictment in the Floyd case could also mark a new paradigm shift.
"They would be forfeiting, to some degree, the advantage of patience," said Thomas Heffelfinger, a Minneapolis lawyer who twice previously served as U.S. attorney in Minnesota. "It is not like there is a statute of limitations here, and it's not like they can't follow up. Even if Chauvin is convicted at the state level, nothing says they can't come along at the federal level."
Color of law cases -- much like terrorism or tax-related prosecutions -- require approval from the Justice Department. Heffelfinger allowed that there may be pressure from Attorney General William Barr, who described the Floyd investigation as a top national priority at the outset. He said federal authorities may also have enough evidence to warrant action now rather than to wait to prosecute.

Full text: Stricken after watching the video of George Floyd dying under a cop's knee, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made a late-night phone call.
His aide Jennifer White was still awake. Their talk, he would recall, was one of the most "emotionally packed" conversations of his life.
Noting the sadness, anger, frustration and pain of watching the footage as a Black woman, White shared her thoughts on how he should draft his public statement about a Black man dying as a white officer knelt on his neck.
"I kind of advised him to lead with his heart and to really speak from that place of honesty," said White, a senior policy aide overseeing public safety, criminal justice and police community relations.
As Floyd's death set off national protests over the systemic oppression of Black people, Frey has tried to navigate his role as a white mayor of a city where Black residents are reeling over racial injustice and police brutality.
Aides pushed for him to have a visible presence in the Black community in the days following Floyd's killing and worried about losing Black approval. In the months since, Frey has solicited advice from Black leaders and staffers, read about the multigenerational harm of racism, and vowed to expand his connections with Black constituents.
For Frey, race was not front and center for much of his political career. He was elected in 2013 to the Minneapolis City Council representing a mostly white ward spanning downtown and Northeast, where he advocated for housing policies to reduce segregation but did not have to confront racial justice in a broader way until the 2017 mayoral campaign.
"I knew from the campaign trail and all of the debates, which centered a lot around racial equity and police accountability, that Jacob Frey was underequipped to tackle many of those issues," said civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, who ran against him. "One of the reasons had to do with his lack of exposure to the native-born [Black] population."
As mayor, Frey said, he has spent more time on the mostly Black North Side than anywhere else outside of his own Northeast neighborhood and City Hall. But after Floyd's death, he knew he had to do more.
"The approach that we took in the days and weeks following George Floyd's killing was to center our Black and brown communities as much as possible," Frey said. "I don't know how many calls I made in that first day to make sure we were reaching out."
The morning after Floyd's killing, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo summoned a group of Black leaders to City Hall, including heads of the NAACP and Urban League, pastors and civil rights activists. North Side activist Al Flowers recalled that when they asked Frey, who walked into the meeting toward the end, if he would support the chief in firing officer Derek Chauvin right away, "the mayor said yes."
Later that night of May 26, Frey went to an hourlong community listening session hosted by Black media outlets. And in the days after, Frey made a point of calling a list of Black leaders, first to apologize. He heard from Black citizens that "it's important for me to both understand my responsibility and also not make this about myself."
In some of his most difficult moments, Frey said, a source of strength was local NAACP President Leslie Redmond praying for him over the phone. He described counsel from her and activist Spike Moss as "blunt and inspirational."
White, for her part, was determined that Black residents see the mayor in person, not just on TV. As aides discussed getting Frey out into the community in the weeks following Floyd's death, White texted policy director Heidi Ritchie, "Yes it was my rec to get him out ASAP. Ilhan was out last night w NAACP. He's gonna lose Black community support if he doesn't."
She'd hoped that Frey could visit North Side volunteers who were trying to protect the neighborhood from vandals and looters. But the chaos of the riots delayed those plans. Later, at the suggestion that she help on community engagement, White texted Ritchie: "I've been pushing for [Frey] to get out since last week to no avail. ... And after this human rights stuff comes out, we are going to lose Black community support," in a reference to the state Department of Human Rights launching a civil rights probe against the city.
White wound up accompanying him with youth violence prevention coordinator Sasha Cotton on a visit to 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was killed. On a separate visit to the memorial, Frey shared an impromptu hug with Flowers -- the first person aside from his wife whom he had embraced after months of social distancing.
In the days after those memorial visits, Frey went to the riot-stricken areas on W. Broadway on his own, toured the destruction on Lake Street with state legislators, went to a community roundtable hosted by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and visited resource and grocery pop-ups in north Minneapolis.
Frey said he's learned more about intergenerational trauma lately by reading "My Grandmother's Hands," a book by Minneapolis therapist Resmaa Menakem that explores the long-lasting psychological damage of racism.
And he has had "I don't know how many conversations" about Floyd's killing with Black staffers, executive assistant Marcus Singleton and senior policy aides Shauen Pearce and Abdi Salah.
Pearce was initially skeptical about working for Frey because she hadn't seen economic inclusion and racial justice prominently in his promotional materials early in the mayoral campaign.
But she saw him absorb input from Black residents to name those issues as a priority.
"One of the critical aspects of economic inclusion and certainly for racial justice is for non-Black people to expand their networks with Black people, and he actually does that," said Pearce.
Some Black leaders were especially pleased with the mayor's participation on a recent panel at Shiloh Baptist Church, where he described his thoughts behind calling for the officers to be fired and criminally charged right away instead of waiting for an investigation.
"Even though he knew what the other side was saying to him -- 'Don't make a statement, hold back, wait 'til more information comes out' -- he was convinced," said Bishop Richard Howell, one of the Black pastors who responded to Arradondo's call to come to City Hall the morning after Floyd's death.
"It seemed like it was a moment of redemption that a white mayor would have the nerve to say what he said to a Black audience. And I can't tell you how good it felt."
The outreach seems to be working, with 60% of Black voters having a favorable view of Frey, compared with 49% of white voters, a Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll found this month. In interviews, Black residents said Frey's unwavering support of Arradondo -- the city's first Black police chief -- engendered goodwill in their community.
Still, some are not impressed. Oluchi Omeoga, a co-founder of Black Visions Collective, said the mayor tries to cultivate relationships with people who share his views on public safety. The collective has pushed to dismantle the Police Department, which Frey and some prominent Black leaders have opposed.
"He's not talking to a diversity of Black folks -- he's only talking to a specific demographic of Black folks," Omeoga said.
The mayor has also drawn detractors who describe his outward empathy with Black causes as performative.
"He says really nice things that put a Band-Aid on it, but I think he bit off more than he can chew," Near North resident Megan Duncan said.
She doesn't like when he conveys his emotional distress over the killing, saying, "George Floyd is dead. What do I care about how you feel? Do something. Be the mayor."
And some Black entrepreneurs are angry that the mayor has not done enough to help them recover after riots damaged many minority-owned businesses. Frey is "failing us again and again," said Abe Demaag, who thinks the mayor should not run again.
Demaag's Furniture City on Lake Street was damaged in the riots. He faults Frey for not coming up with a vision for rebuilding and not reaching out more to business owners in the neighborhood.
Redmond, the NAACP president, generally supports the mayor but said there's more to be done. The city's Black residents were in a state of emergency even before COVID-19 and Floyd's killing, she said, and "the rest of his term I want to see resources poured into the Black community. I want to see specifically a plan of action."

Trump makes Mpls. his message: Unrest in city is central to his bet that "law and order" will help him win.

Full text: Rallying VIP supporters at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport last week, President Donald Trump laid out his plan to carry Minnesota, a potentially pivotal state in the November election.
"You know, the words 'law and order' are words that Democrats don't like to use," Trump said, also offering a preview of a central theme of the Republican National Convention that begins Monday. "They don't think they're politically good. There's nothing wrong with law and order. There's law and order, and you shouldn't be ashamed of it."
Positioning Republicans as a force for stability in the aftermath of the protests and riots that followed George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police, Trump is revving up an issue that has worked over the years to the Republicans' benefit.
GOP candidates up and down the ballot are following his example, turning Minneapolis into an electoral test case: a city run by Democrats whom Republicans charge with failing to do enough to prevent the devastation, then moving to cut police budgets and redefine policing.
Democrats see instead an electorate with rapidly shifting views on race and policing. In former Vice President Joe Biden, they see a nominee with a centrist record on criminal justice issues who opposes efforts by the Minneapolis City Council to dismantle the traditional police department model.
"Most cops are good," Biden said Monday night during the Democratic National Convention, the same day Trump was in Minnesota. "But the fact is the bad ones have to be identified and prosecuted and out, period."
Despite Biden's disavowal, Republicans see an opportunity: "Minnesotans saw chaos in the streets and they saw their Democratic governor, Minneapolis saw its Democratic mayor, they weren't stepping up to the plate to protect and defend these businesses," said Jennifer Carnahan, chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party.
Ron Harris, a Minneapolis city official and member of the Democratic National Committee, argues that the Republican message on the unrest oversimplifies the complexity of the situation that Minnesotans witnessed up close.
"Minneapolis and Minnesota have become the epicenter of this global reckoning on race, and it's opened a conversation about how we got here in the first place," Harris said. "I think a lot of suburban moms saw the video of George Floyd calling for his mom before he died and thought of their own sons."
Republicans say the debate has energized their base and swayed independents. But some national polls suggest Trump may not hold the traditional advantage on law and order that Republicans hold over Democrats. A Washington Post-ABC News poll from mid-July found Biden -- who has held a national polling lead for months -- with a 50-41 advantage over Trump on which candidate to trust on "crime and safety."
A complicating issue to the GOP message, however, is Trump's own record of regularly engaging in or talking about pursuing actions that bend or flout the law, including last week when he raised the prospect of sending deputies to monitor polling sites on Election Day, though he has no authority to do so. Trump also has talked about staying in office for more than two terms, which would violate the Constitution, and has been identified as "Individual 1,'' the unindicted co-conspirator in the successful criminal case against his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, over payoffs to silence two women who said they had sexual relationships with the president before he was elected.
In Minnesota, a few recent polls have shown a closer race than in other battleground states. Some Republicans attribute that in large part to the defund movement in Minneapolis. Trump has never led Biden in a public poll in the state but has come within the margin of error in several, and pulled even in one poll.
"Even if he doesn't beat Biden here, the president calling attention to this issue in Minnesota could put Democrats like Angie Craig and Collin Peterson" -- both running for re-election in House districts Trump carried in 2016 -- "in a difficult place," said Michael Minta, a political-science professor at the University of Minnesota.
Craig's Second Congressional District cuts across suburbs, exurbs, a few small regional towns and rural areas. Facing a well-funded challenge from first-time Republican candidate Tyler Kistner, she, like Biden, has resisted wholesale dismantling of police departments. But in talking about the issue, Craig also acknowledges a broad concern from many Democrats, and not just on the party's far left, that racism is an issue law enforcement agencies must address.
"I've been very clear I don't support defunding police," Craig said in an interview. "We need real, substantive reform to address the systemic racism and inequality in law enforcement. But I've said many times eliminating them is not the answer."
Anger at police officers reached into the Second District earlier this month, when a statue of a policeman was among several vandalized the night the Eagan Police Department canceled a community meeting meant to improve trust between officers and the community. A group of protesters had gathered near the Eagan Tribute and Memorial Plaza ahead of the meeting before the department called it off. The statue of the policeman had "BLM," or Black Lives Matter, spray-painted across it.
"Democratic control has allowed these rioters to burn down cities and bring chaos and destruction," Kistner said, adding he believes Craig has "refused to effectively disavow 'Defund the Police.' "
Kistner said he supports more training and other resources for police departments and more hiring of officers who better reflect the communities they're patrolling. "Hire more officers. They're gravely understaffed, especially in Minneapolis," Kistner said. "Hire officers who look like, talk like and truly represent that community."
Kistner said many voters he's interacted with in recent months have asked him some version of the same question: Are you going to keep our businesses and communities safe?
Craig said it's not only police departments that make communities safer. "Of course people want to feel safe from crime in their communities," she said, adding, "People have asked me many times, how can we make sure my kids are safe when we go to school? How can we make sure we have a good national strategy to get this virus under control? Everyone needs to live in a safe community."
Calls for law and order in the face of social unrest have long been a part of American politics. President Richard Nixon, who in 1972 was the last Republican to carry Minnesota in a presidential race, defeated Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey four years earlier by appealing to the anxiety of voters amid violent Vietnam War protests, high-profile political assassinations and ensuing urban riots.
"It is time for an honest look at the problem of order in the United States," Nixon somberly intoned in a campaign commercial that year, over images of bloodied protesters, helmeted police officers and burning buildings.
"If the Republicans can turn this into an election on law and order, that's a battle that Democrats usually lose, just looking at the polling historically," Minta said. "If you are Democrats and Joe Biden, you would much rather be talking about the president's response to the coronavirus."
Last October -- almost a year before the election -- Trump highlighted the city's crime problems, inviting Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Federation, to his rally at the Target Center. After Floyd's death, Trump initiated his attacks on the city's Democratic leadership moments after the Third Precinct station was torched: "When the looting starts," he tweeted, "the shooting starts."

Full text: The widely recognized mural of George Floyd painted outside the south Minneapolis store where he died while in police custody was defaced Tuesday night, reportedly by a medical student who said he now regrets what he did.
The vandalism occurred despite volunteers keeping careful watch at the memorial on the corner of E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue S. that has become a focal point for thousands stopping there to mourn Floyd and rally for social justice in the three months since his death.
"We will not allow something like this to distract us from our greater goal," said Jeanelle Austin, lead caretaker for the Floyd memorial.
With volunteers at the corner Tuesday night, a man wearing a hoodie walked up to the mural on the side of Cup Foods about 10 p.m. and sprayed black paint over Floyd's eyes and face, Austin said. Video from Cup Foods captured the vandalism.
The suspect, Daniel Michelson, 26, of Rochester, told the Minnesota Reformer, a local online news site, that he'd gotten drunk in his apartment and "didn't realize" what he was doing. He said he had no memory of the incident.
"This is definitely a turning point for me," he told the Reformer. "I was absolutely disgusted because that's not at all representative of who I am or who I strive to be."
Michelson, a medical student, added that he's working with the community to make up for his deed and that he'll pay for repairs to the mural and "anything else."
The Star Tribune was unable to reach Michelson despite repeated attempts.
"He caused harm to the community," Austin said of the suspect. "He needs to be held responsible and take ownership of that. That has to happen."
A Minneapolis police spokesman said Thursday that the department had not yet taken any vandalism reports or made any arrests in connection with the incident.
The vandalism comes as city officials are weighing how to both reopen and preserve 38th and Chicago, which has been closed to vehicles since Floyd's death. The city has allocated $100,000 to create a permanent memorial at the site.
"It's been difficult to find any consensus about how to move forward," David Rubedor, director of the city's neighborhood and community relations division, told City Council members during a public meeting Thursday.
Four officers responded to Cup Foods on the evening of May 25 on a report that Floyd had passed a fake $20 bill and arrested him, leading to his death. They were fired and have been charged, including Derek Chauvin, who is facing murder charges.
Billy Briggs, who lives just feet from where Floyd died, was lighting candles Tuesday night when the suspect began defacing the mural. Briggs gave chase and found a can of spray paint ditched by the suspect but lost him after a couple blocks.
Another volunteer security team from the site caught up with the suspect near Powderhorn Park but let him go after questioning him and taking his picture. Members of the security team talked with Briggs, who confirmed that the man they spoke with was the person he saw defacing the mural.
Briggs, an unemployed photographer who has been documenting the scene for the past three months, returned to the mural and broke down.
"Everybody is struggling with this," he said. "[Floyd] is the face of justice in this movement. This was a devastating thing to do. Shame on you."
A blue tarp, initially put up to cover the damage, was later taken down.
"People need to see what happened," said Austin, who added that she and others were exploring their next moves, including contacting the artists to repaint the mural.
"It's going to take time before changes are done," she said. "At the end of day, we are looking for justice."
Other Floyd murals around the country reportedly have recently been defaced, including those in Rochester, Minn.; Long Beach, Calif., Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore.
Options for the corner
Minneapolis city staffers have attended more than 80 community events to gauge people's feelings about the future of the intersection. Rubedor said that many expressed a desire to create a space to promote racial justice and healing. Some people said they want to prioritize access to businesses and transit, while others said they want to expand homeownership opportunities in the area.
Some people also said they want to create a space for mourning and for public art. Robin Hutcheson, the city's public works director, said they were trying to figure out how to ensure police officers, firefighters and medics could quickly get to the area during an emergency, noting that right now they would have to remove barricades.
While the city debates how to craft a permanent plan for the intersection, Hutcheson said they also were considering how to begin a phased reopening.
One option is to reopen 38th Street but keep Chicago Avenue closed, preserving the roundabout created there by community members. Another option could involve moving a garden and sculpture north of the intersection. Council Member Cam Gordon raised the possibility of turning the intersection into a pedestrian area.
Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins and Council Member Alondra Cano, whose wards meet at the intersection, said they want to create a commission to focus on the task and set a public hearing.
"I want to be clear that the issues around seeking justice are first and foremost in my mind and are very much front and center in this effort," Jenkins said.

Full text: Minneapolis Police Officers Federation President Bob Kroll lashed out at police Chief Medaria Arradondo in a radio interview and called for him to step down, saying Arradondo failed to challenge city officials and protesters in the wake of George Floyd's killing.
Kroll said it was his job as head of the union representing roughly 800 rank-and-file cops to call out "bad leadership" by Arradondo, the latest sign of growing friction between the two leaders. Arradondo made national headlines a few weeks after Floyd's death when he pulled out of contract negotiations with the union, saying he intended to be on the "right side of history."
"I've always gotten along with our current chief, and until this happened, we did get along better than any other [past chief], but I'm going to call out failed leadership where it's at, and that is the entire command staff," said the police lieutenant, who until recently had been publicly supportive of Arradondo. "How can you be a copper 30-plus years and give up your integrity and just go with what you know is absolutely wrong?"
Kroll's comments came in an interview Tuesday on the "Queen and the Cop" program, broadcast on the Mix Radio Network, an online radio station that bills itself as "the only station in the world dedicated to First Responders," according to its Facebook page.
Kroll argued that Arradondo should have pushed harder for more officers after a recent wave of departures since Floyd's death that Kroll says has left the department with fewer than 790 working cops amid rising crime.
"The chief has said we're going to be on the wrong side of history, and he's going to be on the right side of history. Hey, you're the guy that a year ago asked the mayor for 400 more cops over a five-year period, and instead you're getting a 200-officer reduction," he said. "And your officers are in harm's way more than ever, and you're going to take that? No, sir, you're the one that needs to leave and you will be on the wrong side of history."
Dozens of officers have left the department over the past few months and applied for jobs with law enforcement agencies in Washington County, Lino Lakes and Cloquet, according to Kroll.
A police spokesman declined to comment and Kroll did not respond to an interview request.
The tension between the two leaders comes at a crucial time for the city's beleaguered police force, which finds itself grappling with a state human rights investigation, mass departures and continued calls for its defunding, or even abolishment.
Many point to the politically influential union as a significant roadblock to reforming the department. A recent Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 poll found that nearly 80% of residents believe the union has too much influence over the disciplining of officers accused of misconduct.
Kroll also criticized protesters who gathered outside his home in Hugo over the weekend, demanding his removal and destroying effigies of Kroll and his wife, Liz Collin, a WCCO-TV anchor and reporter.
"We're losing control of civil behavior in society these days because of things like this," said Kroll. He said that the protest had left his neighbors rattled.
The outspoken union leader has been a regular target for police reformists, both for his unabashed defense of officers accused of misconduct and because critics believe he represents the kind of policing that has long plagued communities of color.
In 2007, he was named in a racial discrimination lawsuit against the department brought by five Black officers -- including Arradondo -- after Kroll called then-U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison a terrorist and made disparaging comments about a gay aide to former Mayor R.T. Rybak in front of several other high-ranking commanders. Both Kroll and Arradondo have since said they have settled their differences, but their relationship soured after the chief abruptly withdraw from labor negotiations earlier this summer.
Talks between the city and the federation have continued without Arradondo.
Kroll, who first took over as union president in 2015, most recently drew the ire of activists and others, like Mayor Jacob Frey, when he joined President Donald Trump on stage at his rally at Target Center in October. After Floyd's death, Kroll sent a letter to his membership, blasting police brass, Frey and the City Council for what he called the city's lackluster response to the rioting that followed, writing that officers were being made "scapegoats" for the ensuing violence.
"I think the only thing I agree about with Kroll is that civil discourse or civil society seems to be breaking down right now, but this whole vilifying Chief Arradondo is not the way we're going to heal this city through the trauma of George Floyd," Council Member Linea Palmisano said about Kroll's interview.
Kroll's backers say he is being unfairly vilified for doing the fundamental job of a union leader: advocating for his membership.
He joined the department in 1989 and was elected to his first two-year term as union president in 2015. Kroll has signaled he intends to step down next spring after his latest two-year term ends.
But in his interview Tuesday, he said that the recent public backlash had convinced him to stay, despite the fact that he reached retirement age two weeks ago.
"Now these people are causing me to stay, because I can't make it look like they're chasing me out. I've never backed away from a fight in my life," he said. "The same people who want me gone so bad, from the protesters to the mayor to the City Council to the governor, now they're getting me stuck here longer, so the joke's on you."

Audio released of investigators questioning ex-cop Lane: Minneapolis officer told the BCA that the restraint of George Floyd appeared to him to be reasonable.

Full text: An audio recording of a former Minneapolis police officer speaking with investigators about the killing of George Floyd was released by the courts Tuesday.
Thomas Lane told investigators he pulled his gun on Floyd after seeing Floyd sitting in a car reaching under a seat or between his seat and the console and because he did not immediately show his hands when ordered to do so.
Lane said the officers' plan to restrain a handcuffed Floyd stomach-down in the street was reasonable because he appeared to be on drugs.
"Once [Floyd] kind of stopped fighting us, I think I had said again, 'I think we should roll him onto his side,' and I believe [officer Derek] Chauvin said, 'We have him, there's an ambulance coming and we got him. We're just going to hold him here,' " Lane told investigators. "And that made sense to me just because I've had experiences with people who are OD'ing or they'll be out one minute and they'll come back and really be aggressive with you."
On May 25, Lane and former officer J. Alexander Kueng arrested Floyd on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. During the arrest, former officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, Kueng knelt on his back and Lane knelt and held onto his legs. Former officer Tou Thao fended off a gathering crowd.
Lane's 1-hour, 37-minute voluntary interview with investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was audio recorded; there was no video. Lane spoke in a flat, unemotional tone about the incident.
Lane did not bring up that Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck. He first recounted Chauvin's actions about an hour into the interview under questioning by BCA special agent Brent Petersen. "He had his knee up and around, yeah, the shoulders and neck area," Lane said.
Several minutes later, Lane mentioned for the first time that Floyd had said he couldn't breathe.
"Were you getting a sense that Mr. Floyd was having a medical emergency?" Petersen asked.
"Yeah, I felt maybe that something was going on," Lane said, adding that he thought Floyd had passed out. He said he kept watch on a large muscle on the side of Floyd's back called the "lats" to see if it was moving, which would indicate that he was still breathing. When that stopped at some point, he said he asked Kueng to check Floyd's pulse.
A transcript of the interview was filed earlier in the case. Prosecutors filed the actual recording with the court last week to support their motion to try all four former officers charged in Floyd's killing at one trial. Evidence filed with such court documents is public data under state law.
A judge will hear oral arguments on the prosecution's motion at a Sept. 11 hearing. A trial is scheduled for March 8.

Full text: The White House on Monday denied a claim by Gov. Tim Walz that he had "spent this weekend" dissuading Trump officials from a tour of a south Minneapolis memorial to George Floyd, an unarmed Black man whose killing by police sparked days of arson and looting.
Walz's remarks came at a breakfast meeting of Minnesota delegates to the Democratic National Convention. In a video streamed message, he said that he "spent this weekend trying to tell the White House why it was a really bad idea to have President Trump go down and stand at the George Floyd memorial and use it as a backdrop for his campaign and ignite the pain and the anguish we're feeling in Minnesota."
Asked about a planned tour of the Floyd memorial at 38th Street and S. Chicago Av., a White House spokesman referred to a tweet by Trump communications aide Judd Deere: "@GovTimWalz, Who did you reach out to at the White House? Nobody here heard from you. @realdonaldtrump would never use the George Floyd Memorial as a political backdrop, but he does want to hear from business owners impacted by the riots which he is doing @mspairport right now."
Ben Williamson, a top White House adviser, also denied any contact with Walz, tweeting, "Nobody in the Chief of Staff's office, or anybody in the White House for that matter, heard from Governor Walz this weekend. So this is false on multiple levels."
On his way to Mankato, Trump spoke to a group of supporters at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Though he met with business owners affected by the riots, he did not go into the city.
A Walz spokesman declined to comment on the exchange.

Virus threw wrench into Carter's gun violence plan: As violence in St. Paul eclipses last year's pace, some council members impatient for action, information.

Full text: St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter's $1.7 million suite of new programs and services to curb gun violence has been delayed, altered or canceled this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis.
As the Capital City endures a summer even more violent than the one that prompted Carter's "community-first public safety budget," some City Council members say they're frustrated by the pace of change and have struggled to get information about how the budget they approved is being spent.
"I have not seen a prior administration that has been so remote from the council in terms of the budget and in terms of a major initiative like this," said Council Member Jane Prince.
The $1.7 million supplemental public safety budget was intended to pay for a range of proposals, including hiring community ambassadors, helping renters with criminal histories find housing, developing alternative prosecution models and launching a communications center for sharing information about public safety downtown.
Most initiatives are in their early stages, with foundational steps like hiring still underway. Some, including the housing program, downtown communications center and "community EMTs" in the fire department, won't be fully realized until late 2020 or 2021.
In an interview, Carter said the pandemic "threw all of our timelines for the year off, but I think we are getting up and running pretty well."
Two line items in the original budget -- the Right Track youth employment program and community EMTs -- have been shaved down, and a pedestrian safety engineer won't be hired as originally planned, Carter said. The total savings in 2020 will be at least $394,000, according to Carter spokesman Peter Leggett.
The pandemic has made it harder to communicate with the public, Carter said, though more details will be available in his 2021 budget address later this month.
"My invitation for anyone who has had criticism is you can do more than sit at home and criticize it, but plug into the process and help us continually make this construct better so that we can serve our city as well as possible," he said.
The tension between city leaders comes amid a surge in gun violence in St. Paul, where shots-fired calls have more than doubled compared with this time last year. In fact, every metric of violent crime, excluding rape, is up by more than 30%.
At least 126 people have been shot in St. Paul this year, including 19 who were killed. Homicides are already on track to surpass last year's record high in shooting deaths.
Nationally, the pandemic has had an uneven effect on crime, although several large cities have seen significant upticks in violence since the unrest that followed George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Criminologists say the causes are unchanged -- inadequate housing, unemployment, poverty and other forms of neglect, coupled with a seemingly bottomless supply of illegal firearms.
Carter's approach to public safety has focused on root causes. Since taking office, he's directed money to services such as recreation centers, libraries and housing instead of more cops. Carter cut five officer positions in his 2020 budget; in 2021, belt-tightening in the police department could mean unprecedented layoffs of active-duty officers.
Last year, faced with the city's highest homicide rate in 25 years, Carter brought forward his supplemental public safety budget in a rare presentation to the council, saying it was "perhaps the most comprehensive approach to public safety and crime prevention that our city has ever taken."
Council members were supportive, and continue to point to community-first public safety as a reason they're not interested in dismantling their police department. But their desire to see results, especially as crime continues to rise, has fueled frustration.
Council Member Rebecca Noecker, who said she's heard from constituents wondering what's going on, said she got an update on community-first public safety Tuesday and wants that information shared publicly.
Betsy Mowry Voss, executive director of the Southeast Community Organization, said she attended an Aug. 3 roundtable with the city's community-first public safety work group, which meets weekly and is made up of the Mayor's Office, city departments including police and fire, St. Paul-Ramsey County Public Health, the Downtown Alliance and community ambassadors.
Mowry Voss said she supports the mayor's plan, but "it feels really preliminary."
"It is missing the community members it's supposed to be serving," she said. "The strongest thing you can do as an organizer, and in making change, is to involve the people who change is being made for. And we're not seeing that yet."
Across the city, community organizations have a history of working to stem violence on their own -- and recently, some have taken matters into their own hands.
In March, St. Paul-Ramsey County Public Health applied for up to $220,000 in federal grant money to implement a Group Violence Intervention (GVI) strategy to fight gang violence. The money would have funded a dedicated Ramsey County violence prevention coordinator, comparable to Minneapolis' position, housed in Carter's office.
The grant recipient has yet to be formally announced, but applicants confirmed that a coalition of African American community organizations in St. Paul won that funding instead.
The African American Leadership Council and St. Paul Black Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance submitted a competing proposal after Carter declined to pursue the grant last year.
Tyrone Terrill, president of the Leadership Council, downplayed any conflict with the Mayor's Office, instead saying that residents wanted more direct involvement in the solution.
"We felt this is not a police or a government problem," he said, referring to rising gun violence. "This is a community problem."
Terrill will serve as project manager and eventually hire two case managers tasked with doing street outreach work with troubled youth. Without the grant, it's unclear whether the city and county will fill the violence prevention coordinator position, or how it would be funded.
With four months left in the year and a projected multimillion-dollar deficit in 2020, it's also unclear what community-first public safety will look like in 2021. Council members won't know what's in Carter's budget address until they hear it -- though Noecker said she's asked for details.
"Given the murder of George Floyd and the calls for police reform that we're hearing and that we're responding to, community-first public safety is going to be dovetailing with whatever those efforts are that we take next," she said. "That can't just be something that happens behind closed doors in the Mayor's Office."

Full text: Most Minneapolis residents said they believe that George Floyd's killing was not an isolated incident but reflects a broader problem with how the city's police treat Black people, according to a new Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll.
That view was shared across racial lines, though white residents were more likely than Black residents to see his death as an example of structural flaws within the Minneapolis Police Department, the poll showed. The findings also showed that residents overwhelmingly believe that Black people and white people are not treated the same by the criminal justice system -- a view shared by 96% of Black voters and 82% of white voters.
"It's rooted in systemic oppression of 400 years of suppressing Black people," said Undrea Patterson, 42, who is Black. She said that since Floyd's May 25 death in police custody, many Americans are beginning to face the reality that the criminal justice system is in many ways stacked against people of color. "We're still dealing with all these systems that were set up to keep Black people in a lesser capacity and not just as real participants in society," she said.
Patterson, who said her 15-year-old cousin Courtney Williams was fatally shot by police in 2004, said that she is more hopeful for change now because Floyd's death marked a watershed moment in the city's history.
The findings come as the embattled city of Minneapolis continues to grapple with a state investigation into allegations of human rights abuses by its officers and other fallout from the police killing of Floyd, which sparked protests against racial injustice and police brutality around the world.
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and Mayor Jacob Frey have promised significant reforms in hopes of building public trust, while saying that institutional change does not happen overnight. Meanwhile, some City Council members are pushing to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department in favor of a new "transformative" public safety system, although a controversial charter amendment that would have opened the door for such a change has been shelved for now.
The poll was conducted for the news organizations by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy Inc., which surveyed 800 registered Minneapolis voters last week, including 146 Black voters. In addition, 354 more interviews were conducted with Black registered voters in the city, for a total of 500. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5% for the sample of 800 registered Minneapolis voters, and the margin of error for the sample of 500 Black Minneapolis registered voters is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
The citywide survey found a generational split on the national Black Lives Matter movement, with 88% of respondents ages 18-34 having a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter. But support began to drop off some among those 65 and older, 71% of whom were in favor of the movement and its goals.
Black Lives Matter first came to prominence six years ago in response to the fatal shootings of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, but was reignited during the unrest that followed Floyd's death.
ChaRee Headley, 39, said that as a white woman, the incident forced her to dig into difficult conversations with her family.
Headley, an archivist for an architectural firm, said that she recently got into an argument with her grandmother while explaining "that it's not against the white people, it's the fact that the white people aren't stepping up to do what they should be doing to help."
"She's refusing to take my phone call right now," Headley said of her grandmother. "People need to understand that this is not going away -- we can't ignore it, we have to fight the racism and we have to be better."
Pat Tucker, 73, a retired school secretary who lives with her husband on the North Side, said she supports police because of her neighborhood's crime problem, but agrees that the department needs to root out a permissive culture that allows certain officers to get away with bad acts for years.
"I think some of the police, not all, have done things in the past that have been overlooked by their department, and therefore if a person's actions aren't dealt with then they feel they can continue and probably escalate their behavior even if it's negative," said Tucker, who is Black.
On the matter of whether Floyd's death was part of a bigger pattern of police mistreatment of Blacks, the poll found that respondents' political leanings influenced their opinions, with 93% of Democrats agreeing there was a broader problem, compared to 58% of Republicans. Women were more likely to hold that view than men, by a 90 to 79% response.
Among Black voters, most were supportive of Black Lives Matter and felt that Floyd's death was part of a broader problem, although male voters and those over 50 were slightly more likely to see it as an isolated incident. There was equally strong consensus on the question of whether Black people and white people are treated equally by the justice system: An overwhelming majority felt they are not.
Eveline Williams, who is retired after a career in nursing, said that in some ways, the unrest that followed Floyd's death resembled the urban riots of the 1960s, although she disagreed with the arson and looting now as she did then. She said she felt that police conduct had improved since those days and that Floyd's death, while tragic, was something of an outlier.
"I think it was isolated, it was just something that happened and shouldn't have happened, but it did," said Williams, who is Black. "I live a simple life and I haven't experienced a lot."
But the latest poll results suggest a shift in attitudes.
Although it's not a direct comparison, a 2016 poll of registered voters in the wake of another controversial police shooting, the killing of Jamar Clark, found that 43% of white respondents thought the criminal justice system treated Black people and white people equally, compared with 8% of Black respondents.
When it came to voters' opinion of Black Lives Matter, 24% of white respondents expressed a favorable view of the movement, while 53% had an unfavorable view; Black voters were 53% and 19%, respectively.

Source: Star Tribune/MPR/KARE 11 Minn. Poll, Aug. 10-12, 2020: 800 Mpls. registered voters, +/-3.5% margin of error and Aug. 6-12, 2020: 500 Black Mpls. registered voters, +/-4.5% margin of error.
HOW THIS POLL WAS CONDUCTED
The findings of this Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11
Minnesota Poll are based on live interviews conducted Aug.
10 to Aug. 12 with 800 Minneapolis registered voters. That
sample included interviews with 525 self-identified white
registered voters and 146 African-American registered voters.
An additional 354 interviews were conducted Aug. 6 to
Aug. 12 with African-American registered voters in Minneapolis,
for a total of 500 interviews. This is commonly
referred to as an "oversample," and allows for an applesto-
apples comparison of the responses of white voters and
Black voters. This poll was conducted for the Star Tribune,
Minnesota Public Radio News and KARE 11 by Mason-Dixon
Polling and Strategy Inc.
Those interviewed were randomly selected by computer
from a phone-matched Minneapolis voter registration list
that included both land line and cellphone numbers. For the
sample of 800 Minneapolis registered voters, 29% of the interviews
were conducted via land line and 71% via cellphone.
For the sample of 500 African-American registered voters,
26% of the interviews were conducted via land line and
74% via cellphone.
The margin of sampling error for the sample of 800 Minneapolis
registered voters, according to standards customarily
used by statisticians, is no more than ± 3.5 percentage
points. This means there is a 95 percent probability that the
"true" figure would fall within that range if all voters were
surveyed. The margin of sampling error for the sample of
500 African-American Minneapolis registered voters is no
more than ± 4.5 percentage points. The margin of error is
higher for any subgroup, such as a gender or age grouping.

seeking equal justice: Several major law firms are stepping up free legal help to counter racial disparities

Full text: In the wake of George Floyd's killing, some of Minnesota's marquee law firms are suing cities and racing to give free legal aid to those facing racial inequities.
Twin Cities firms such as Dorsey & Whitney, Fish & Richardson, Ballard Spahr and Fredrikson & Byron are stepping up efforts or starting new ones to represent, free of charge, those who say they are victims of police violence or partnering with unions and community groups to challenge racial disparities in police arrests, housing, hiring and voting access.
In some cases, the firms are suing cities and police officers. Others are adopting the approach of Dorsey & Whitney, which last month terminated its decadeslong Minneapolis city attorney's program that helped prosecute misdemeanor cases in the city. Still others are marshaling attorneys to expunge old criminal records, to staff voting polls and to end housing discrimination.
"The murder of George Floyd magnified the need to focus on inequities," said Pamela Wandzel, director of Pro Bono & Community Service at Fredrikson & Byron (F&B) in Minneapolis. "People of color are impacted. … So, we look at it under a different lens and say, 'How can we change the laws and policies and rules that are really feeding into these racial injustices?' "
In June, F&B sued the city of Minneapolis and police officials on behalf of the Communications Workers of America for arresting reporters during protests that broke out after Floyd's May 25 killing. This month, the firm is working with protesters in
Des Moines who allege police there cornered them and then sprayed them with chemicals when they could not disperse. A lawsuit has not yet been filed.
Last month, the intellectual property firm Fish & Richardson launched its pro bono racial justice legal program.
In July, Fish & Richardson partnered with the American Civil Liberties Union and sued the city of Minneapolis, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and police union head Lt. Bob Kroll on behalf of four protesters who said they were hurt by police rubber-coated bullets, tear gas and pepper spray in May while peacefully protesting on Lake Street in Minneapolis three days after Floyd's killing.
"Law enforcement often fired without constitutionally sufficient warning or orders to leave, thereby violating their due-process rights," said Ahmed Davis, the firm's national diversity director who is leading the case. "The police in Minnesota, and throughout our country, should be protecting and serving those who exercise their [freedom of assembly] rights under the law, not impeding and chilling such actions."
This month, the firm is interviewing potential victims of police brutality in Louisiana.
The 400-attorney firm with offices in Minneapolis, D.C., Europe and China is better known for patent and intellectual-property litigation. It also does work on veteran, child welfare, voter suppression and death row issues, but is now ramping up racial-justice work as a specialty.
"We plan to continue fighting for basic constitutional and human rights," Davis said.
The firm has company. After Floyd's death "Dorsey is immediately placing an even greater emphasis on pro bono work that helps rebuild communities, and will no longer support misdemeanor prosecutions in Minneapolis," said Bill Stoeri, the Dorsey & Whitney managing partner.
Black and Latino communities across the city have long complained of being targeted by police for infractions that do not attract the same attention or result in the same level of charges when committed by white people. Law partners said Floyd's recorded killing and the conversations that followed have shifted perspectives.
"Healing can only occur by addressing the systemic racism that plagues us," Stoeri said.
Three weeks ago, Ballard Spahr's offices in Philadelphia and Minneapolis launched their own Racial Justice and Equality Initiative, a pro bono plan dedicated to combating racial disparities via a mix of lawsuits and volunteer work.
Karla Vehrs, Ballard Spahr's Minnesota office managing partner, is rounding up attorneys to volunteer as election workers so voting stations in poorer neighborhoods have enough staff to stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The firm also is corralling legal pros to get old felony records expunged to allow former inmates a better shot at getting jobs and housing in the Twin Cities. Another push: looking at potential lawsuits against lenders and landlords who refuse to deal with former nonviolent inmates even when the offense is old and had nothing to do with money or housing.
Vehrs said such work will be done by partnering with All Square, a gourmet grilled-cheese restaurant in Minneapolis that hires, counsels and trains Minnesotans with criminal records. The entity is about to open its own legal firm with help from pro bono programs like the one at Ballard Spahr, said All Square CEO Emily Hunt Turner.
Vehrs, who first arranged pro bono legal assistance for All Square following a contract dispute in 2018, said she's "excited" to do more after seeing its employee "fellows" at work.
"We're trying to do our part to address that we have these enormous disparities in Minnesota and other places," Vehrs said. The firm hopes to litigate cases that can bring relief to larger groups of marginalized people, Vehrs said. "With a robust legal team, there are issues where we can make a difference."
Raygne Parker, a Black employee at All Square, spent five years in prison for a theft committed as a teenager.
Released five years ago, she learned her record wouldn't be expunged for at least 12 years.
"You can't find any housing and what you can find is a slumlord. It took me a year and a half to find housing when I got out," she said. "Nobody would rent to me. And when they did my apartment had mice and roaches and bedbugs."
Jobs were also hard to get. She felt her treatment was unfair, "but a lot of us can't afford an attorney."
Hunt Turner said that kind of barrier is where pro bono programs can help. "Using criminal records to deny housing has segregated America," she said.
As for Vehrs, she's all in. "This is exactly the kind of stuff we are interested in taking on."
The new racial focus builds on Ballard Spahr's past work giving free legal advice to immigrant business owners in Austin, Minn., and sending attorneys annually to represent immigrants detained in Southern border states by U.S. immigration officials.
"We recognize that as professionals, we are in positions of privilege, and with this privilege comes the responsibility to both acknowledge the inequities of our system and to fight them actively," said Ballard Spahr Chairman Mark Stewart.

IN APPLETON STREETS, DIVIDED THEY STAND: SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES,TRUMP SUPPORTERS FACE OFF IN SIDEWALK WAR OF IDEAS.

Full text: APPLETON, MINN. - Rachel Rigenhagen arrives first and plants 29 small American flags along the curb, matching each one to a seam in the sidewalk outside the town hall. By the time she's finished, other masked members of her Appleton Community Diversity Coalition are showing up, carrying hand-painted signs reading "End Racism," "End White Silence" and "Racism Is Real."
At the other end of the block, Chuck Nielsen and Deanna Morrow unfurl large "Trump 2020" flags as unmasked supporters wearing red Trump hats cluster around them.
It's Thursday afternoon at 4:30. And that means it's time for the dueling demonstrations that have become a weekly fixture in this town of 1,400 residents about 150 miles west of the Twin Cities. Each week, social justice warriors gather to advocate for their vision of peace, diversity and equity.
And each week, supporters of President Donald Trump are on hand to protest what they believe are the destructive actions of some demonstrators for social justice. It's a microcosm of what's happening in America, with both sides passionately proclaiming their views and neither side appearing to make much headway in convincing the other.
"It's a bunch of bullcrap," Stan Munstermann, a white Trump supporter from nearby Dawson, Minn., said heatedly. "Black Lives Matter is racist as hell."
"These Black Lives Matter people, if you hid a paycheck under their work boots, they'd never find it. Or a job application," said Nielsen, a white retired trucker from the neighboring village of Holloway, Minn. Without offering proof, Nielsen and others insisted that the coalition demonstrators were being paid $15 an hour for their protest, a charge coalition members said wasn't true.
Rigenhagen, a white science teacher at Lac qui Parle Valley High School in Madison, Minn., started the diversity coalition after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May sparked a worldwide wave of protests for justice.
The group began its weekly demonstration in June; shortly after, counterdemonstrators started showing up.
"The resistance is discouraging," Rigenhagen said. "But at least on Thursdays, I feel good that I'm among other people who feel the same."
"There's strength in numbers," said Jeremy Langford, a Black resident of Appleton who said he's personally experienced a lot of racism.
"I've been called the N-word," Langford said. "Or people will say, 'I don't have any problem with you -- it's the rest of them.' "
Since George Floyd's death, activists along Minnesota's western edge have found a new energy, several organizers said. In cities such as Marshall and Montevideo, demonstrators have been emboldened to speak up in a conservative part of the state.
This region near the South Dakota border voted solidly for Trump; the four counties including and closest to Appleton all supported the president with between 59% and 61% of the vote in 2016. But social justice organizers said they're becoming more assertive about speaking their minds.
Before Floyd's death, people on the left may have been inclined to keep their views to themselves, said Celeste Suter, a leader of the Montevideo Area Peace Seekers.
"It's kind of that whole Minnesota Nice thing," said Suter, who is white. "These are my friends; they may not believe what I believe, but we're just going to kind of skirt that subject."
Now she's less likely to feel she can't voice an opinion that may be unpopular with her neighbors.
"We live in a wonderful country. We love America," Suter said. "It just has some quirks that need to be ironed out so we have true liberty and justice for all."
The Trump demonstrators in Appleton condemned the social unrest and property damage that followed Floyd's death.
"They're stealing [stuff], burning stuff up," Nielsen said, adding that he's demonstrating "for my children and grandchildren. I'm like Martin Luther King."
King was mentioned frequently by the Trump supporters, who cited the civil rights leader's dream to have his children judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
"Martin Luther King was a great man. So were other Black people," said Morrow, who is white and doesn't work because of a disability. "But these thugs who steal and burn things and kill people execution-style. …" Morrow said she's upset that the media don't give more coverage to Black-on-white crime, citing the recent death of a 5-year-old white boy in North Carolina who was allegedly shot in the head by a Black man as he rode his bike.
Several of the Trump supporters refused to give their names, saying they feared violent reprisals from Black Lives Matter supporters.
"I don't want a drive-by shooting," said one white man, who brought a bullhorn to the protest and sat in a lawn chair.
Said another white man, "With the things going on in the big city, we're afraid to say anything, because they might burn our house down."
Derek Sachs, a 25-year-old Walmart employee and Trump supporter, said such protests are a healthy expression of First Amendment rights.
"Everyone has a right to their own opinion," said Sachs, who is white. "When you start telling people they're wrong, I draw the line."
The coalition demonstrators, numbering about 45, and the dozen or so Trump supporters kept to their own ends of the block. One of the few people to start a dialogue with the other camp was Cynthia Huse, a white retired United Church of Christ pastor from Madison. She's had a lot of practice -- her husband is a Trump voter.
Her message to the other side, she said, is that "we're all guilty people. We're just trying to live together as a country."
The demonstrators waved as cars and trucks drove by, honking to show support for one side or the other. At one point, a green pickup flying two large Trump flags drove slowly by, then turned and drove by again.
Living as a minority in rural Minnesota can be hard, said Reena Petrich, a 16-year-old Anishinaabe student at Yellow Medicine East High School in Granite Falls.
"I think we get looked at differently and treated differently," she said. "I think some people don't understand, and they think it's all about politics."
At 5:30, the dueling demonstrations ended, right on schedule. People packed up their signs and flags and water bottles and drifted off. A few remained to chat in small clusters. By 5:45, the sidewalk was empty.
Until next Thursday.

Thao says he trusted colleagues on Floyd: Former officer told investigators he was focused on crowd control.

Full text: The former Minneapolis police officer who stood by as three officers fatally restrained George Floyd told investigators he was focused on an angry crowd and trusted his colleagues to respond appropriately, according to a video released Friday.
Prosecutors filed the video of Tou Thao's voluntary interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) in court this week to support their motion to try all four former officers in one trial. The 1-hour, 40-minute interview, recorded eight days after Floyd was killed, showed that Thao did not become visibly emotional while recounting the incident and appeared to distance himself from his colleagues' actions.
In Minnesota, no interview with a police officer charged with killing a civilian on the job has been made public before trial until now; state law dictates that evidence submitted to the court at any point is public data.
Thao spoke frequently about the officers' safety, only addressing Floyd's well-being and bystanders' concerns for Floyd when questioned by BCA special agent Brent Petersen.
"As the crowd is starting to grow and become loud and hostile toward us, I decided to forgo [monitoring] traffic and put myself in between the crowd and the officers … and just spend the majority of my attention looking at the crowd -- make sure they don't charge us or bull rush us as the officers on the ground are defenseless," Thao said, adding that he was a "human traffic cone."
Thao kept several angry bystanders at bay in front of Cup Foods as former officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for roughly 8 minutes while a handcuffed Floyd lay stomach-down in the street. Former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane restrained Floyd's back and legs after responding to a call that he had allegedly used a fake $20 bill.
Thao's body camera video, released Thursday as part of a motion filed by his attorney to dismiss the case against him, showed that Thao was aggressive with bystanders and pushed two men who stepped off the sidewalk into the street.
In the BCA video, Thao was questioned about his professional history before spending about 12 minutes summarizing the events of May 25 without interruption. Petersen and BCA special agent James Reyerson asked him several questions afterward as his attorney, Robert Paule, and an FBI agent looked on.
During his summary, Thao said Floyd appeared to be on drugs, resisted getting into a squad car and kicked himself out of the squad onto the street.
Thao said his colleagues grew tired as they restrained Floyd on the ground, but he never voluntarily mentioned Chauvin's actions, that Floyd repeatedly told them he couldn't breathe and was going to die, or that several bystanders, including an off-duty Minneapolis firefighter, urged the officers to stop and to check Floyd's pulse.
Nor did he say that the officers continued to pin Floyd after he became unresponsive.
"They're trying to get control of his body," Thao said. "I could tell the officers on the ground were getting tired. Everyone's breathing hard …"
According to the video: Thao and Chauvin, who worked 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., were about to eat dinner at the Third Precinct when they heard a request from Kueng and Lane for backup.
"It sounded like it was something urgent, like they were struggling with somebody," Thao said.
As the only squad available, Thao and Chauvin headed toward Cup Foods, where Kueng and Lane had arrived about 8 p.m. Halfway there, dispatch canceled the backup. But Thao, who was driving, said he was compelled to respond anyway "knowing the area" and because Kueng and Lane were rookies.
The corner is a gang hangout "especially hostile" to police, Thao said. Kueng and Lane were on their third and fourth day on the job, respectively.
Under questioning from Petersen, Thao said he first realized the seriousness of the situation when a firetruck arrived at the scene after an ambulance had already transported Floyd -- a sign, he said that someone needed dire medical attention.
Kueng, Thao said, did not appear to understand the seriousness, either. Kueng recommended that they lock up the vehicle Floyd had been driving and leave it parked on the street instead of securing it and the scene as evidence. (Lane was in the ambulance with Floyd.)
"I stopped him …," Thao said. "I don't think he realized the gravity of the situation -- potential situation, so I tell him, 'No, we're not gonna leave the scene.' "
Petersen pressed Thao about why there was urgency to arrest Floyd and whether, as a more veteran officer, he could have suggested alternative actions.
"Um, first, um, this wasn't our call," Thao said. "We were just the backup officers, so we don't -- I don't have the back information as far as what happened prior to us arriving."
Nearly an hour into the video, Petersen asked Thao what Floyd was saying as he was restrained.
"He was saying that he couldn't breathe," Thao said, "but then he was obviously yelling and talking."
It was about that point in the recording that Thao addressed Chauvin's actions.
"What did you see officer Chauvin doing?" Petersen asked.
"He's struggling with the guy …," Thao said, " … his knees are moving depending on, like, the suspect that's moving, between the back of the head, neck, shoulder blade."
Petersen asked him about handcuffing techniques and whether he had been trained at Minneapolis police to use a knee in such encounters.
"So that maneuver you saw officer Chauvin use, is that something you've been trained in?" Petersen asked.
"I've never used it," Thao said.
Petersen challenged Thao's perception of the bystanders and walked him through learning about Floyd's death.
"When you learned that Mr. Floyd had died, what'd you think?" Petersen asked.
"I don't want anyone to die," Thao said without displaying an obvious emotional reaction. "It was kind of a somber moment, especially for me. My heart kind of sank."
Reyerson asked Thao whether he checked on Floyd at any point.
"No, because my job is scene security," Thao said. "I would trust [the other officers] … God only gave me one body and two hands and two legs. I can't be in two places at once, so."
Thao, Kueng and Lane are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Chauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Frey has leaner budget for 2021: Mpls. mayor offers first look at scaled-back plans in wake of coronavirus, Floyd unrest.

Full text: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Friday gave the first preview of his plans for a 2021 budget that will be scaled back as the city deals with multiple financial challenges.
"Under the weight of the [coronavirus] pandemic and on the heels of the civil unrest following George Floyd's killing, our city's finances are under severe duress," Frey said in a video aired Friday morning.
The mayor's budget address was unlike those of recent years, providing only a high-level overview, while the specifics are expected by the end of September. The city said that's consistent with what other mayors have done following similar crises, such as prior recessions and the collapse of the I-35W bridge.
This year's budget cycle is expected to be more painful than those in many prior years as the city struggles to balance an increased demand for services against the reality that cash is in shorter supply.
"As we weigh what we can forgo, we also understand the undeniable need for new investments," Frey said. "Public safety and racial justice work following the killing of George Floyd has taken on a new level of urgency. Minneapolis is at a make-or-break moment."
The city stressed that the proposal Frey previewed Friday is likely to change significantly before the final budget is adopted in December.
The city is still closely monitoring how the financial markets will respond to the recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The November election will determine which state and federal leaders take office next year -- and how likely they might be to provide financial assistance to cities. City Council members will also get a chance to offer their counterproposals as the city debates controversial issues, such as the future of the Minneapolis Police Department.
Council Member Linea Palmisano, the chairwoman of the budget committee, said she expects there will be cuts to "almost every department."
"As the mayor said, we don't have all the details of our budget just yet, but I think there's still some meaningful conversations that we can have," she said during Friday's council meeting.
Palmisano said she expects she and her colleagues will begin debating the high-level budget plans in mid-September.
The sketch Frey provided Friday calls for about $1.1 billion in spending and just shy of $1.4 billion in revenue. The mayor's office cautioned against trying to compare it too closely with other years noting that some aspects, such as the budget for the Minneapolis Parks & Recreation Board, are still being added into the totals.
The city initially approved a $1.6 billion budget for 2020 but later trimmed it to about $1.4 billion following the pandemic's arrival in Minnesota.
Frey's preliminary 2021 proposal relies on a 5.75% increase in the property tax levy, though the city said the effects of that should be offset by revenue brought in from the expiration of a special taxing district.
The revenue from properties in the Consolidated TIF District had been used to cover Target Center acquisition bonds, affordable housing and neighborhood funding. Tax revenue from those properties can now be used for a wider range of expenses.
The city projects that someone whose home is valued at $281,500 would see their Minneapolis property tax bill decrease by about $47 for the year.
Frey's plan also calls for extending a hiring freeze that went into effect in 2020 amid the pandemic's first wave. That would leave frozen the jobs of some police officers who are not now on full duty. The city is authorized for about 880 officers but has not been hitting that mark. Departures accelerated after the unrest that followed Floyd's killing.
The city said 41 officers have left this year and four others were in the process of leaving earlier this week. The city projects that another 63 officers will leave before the end of the year as a result of regular departures or approval of claims for post-traumatic stress disorder.
The mayor said he also plans to launch an early retirement incentive program. The goal, he said, would be to reduce the city's workforce while avoiding layoffs that would likely impact the least senior and most diverse employees.
The mayor promised "significant ongoing funding for affordable housing programming," saying he intends to make the Stable Homes, Stable Schools program permanent. It has been operating on a trial basis.
The mayor also promised to increase funding for the Office of Violence Prevention by $2.5 million and to continue examining which job tasks can be moved out of the Police Department to other offices. He cited, as an example, a recent effort to have the city's 311 department process some theft reports that don't require an officer to immediately be on scene.

38th & Chicago opening to wait: Intersection where George Floyd died won't open as planned week of Aug. 17.

Full text: Minneapolis city officials are postponing plans to reopen the intersection where George Floyd died.
The intersection at 38th and Chicago Avenue won't open Monday as planned as community activists and city officials work to figure out what to do with the area where Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25. The intersection has a memorial in the middle of it, featuring a large sculpture of a raised fist, with the area filled with art and writings honoring Floyd and other Black people killed by police.
"City staff had discussed the possibility of a potential phased reopening the week of Aug. 17, but discussions continue with community and no firm plans have been announced," Sarah McKenzie, a spokeswoman for the city, said in an e-mail.
City staff will provide an update on 38th and Chicago on Thursday during the Minneapolis City Council's Policy & Government Oversight Committee meeting.
Residents who have occupied what they call the "George Floyd Square Zone" have circulated a list of demands they want enacted before the barricades are removed. Those include recalling Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, requiring officers to have private liability insurance and allocating funding for residents and businesses in the area.
Some of the businesses in the area never closed or started reopening, including Cup Foods, the convenience store whose 911 call led to Floyd's death.
In September, the City Council is slated to consider giving Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th streets the commemorative name of "George Perry Floyd Jr. Place."

Third officer's bodycam footage in Floyd killing released by judge

Full text: A third body camera video from the day George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police was publicly released by the court Thursday, showing that an officer pushed two men as he tried to keep angry bystanders at bay.
Former officer Tou Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, filed Thao's body camera video with the court to support a motion to dismiss criminal charges against him. Paule has argued in court filings that the case should be dropped because Thao was focused on crowd control and didn't have a full view of what was happening as three of his former colleagues restrained Floyd, among other reasons.
The video showed that Thao grew aggressive as he engaged with a growing number of bystanders, including a 17- and 9-year-old, who gathered out front of Cup Foods on Chicago Avenue at E. 38th St. to watch.
Thao yelled at the group, told them "This is why you don't do drugs, kids," and said officers spent 10 minutes trying to get Floyd into the back seat of a squad car
before restraining him in the street. The span was closer to 4½ minutes.
About 11 minutes into the video, a young man watched in disbelief as former officers Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane held onto an unresponsive Floyd stomach-down in the street behind a squad car. Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck long after Floyd had stopped talking and moving.
The man stepped off the sidewalk into the street and looked on stunned, prompting Thao to push him in the chest with one hand. The man didn't immediately obey Thao's orders to step back.
He swiped Thao's hand away before returning to the sidewalk.
A little over a minute later, another man stepped off the sidewalk into the street. He previously told the officers he had gone through the police academy.
"You're gonna just sit there with your knee on his neck, bro?" the man said. "You're a real man, bro."
The man held his cellphone aloft as if to record the incident.
"Get back on the [sidewalk]!" Thao yelled as he used his right hand to push the man's chest.
"Don't touch me!" the man yelled several times as he leapt backward with his arms in the air.
The video's release provided a fuller picture of the May 25 scene where Floyd was killed after being investigated for allegedly using a fake $20 bill at Cup Foods. Bodycam videos recorded by Lane and Kueng were broadly released Monday after the media and public were allowed to view them last month by appointment.
Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, filed the first two videos in early July along with a motion to dismiss the charges against his client. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill will hear oral arguments on Paule's and Gray's motions at a Sept. 11 hearing.
As part of a motion filed Wednesday to try all four former officers in one trial next March, prosecutors filed Thao's and Lane's interviews with investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension with the court. Those recordings were sent via mail, and had not been received by the court for public distribution, a court spokesman said Thursday.
In court filings, Paule argued that Thao never physically laid hands on Floyd and that he offered a hobble restraint which wasn't used, and that would have negated a neck restraint.
Thao also contacted emergency medical personnel and asked them to increase their urgency from a code 2 to a code 3, which activated their lights and sirens, Paule wrote in a memo filed last week. The moment was captured by Thao's body camera.
"The last time Officer Thao turned around to see what was happening, Mr. Floyd was alive and breathing," Paule wrote. "Officer Thao spent the time during the arrest of Mr. Floyd focused on keeping the civilian bystanders out of the scene to allow the other three officers to effectuate the legal arrest."
Thao's bodycam video showed that about 9 minutes in, a woman approached him from behind and introduced herself as a Minneapolis firefighter, which he openly questioned. She asked if Floyd had a pulse.
"Back off!" Thao yelled at the woman as he repeatedly pointed a finger in her face. "Get off the street!"
"I'm watching," the woman said as she stepped onto the sidewalk. "Does he have a pulse? Check -- check for a pulse, please."
Prosecutors confirmed the woman's employment as a Minneapolis firefighter and argued in court filings that the officers rejected her help and relegated her to the sidewalk, although Kueng took Floyd's pulse at some point and told his colleagues that he couldn't detect one.
After Floyd was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, Thao crossed the street and told a Minneapolis Park Police officer who was assisting that he had left his body camera on because the bystanders were "hostile." He also told the officer and Chauvin that a male bystander had "allegedly" gone through the police academy.
"Uh huh," Chauvin said. "Of course."
"And the other lady over there is a firefighter, so -- allegedly," Thao said.
"Of course," Chauvin said. "Of course."
Thao, Kueng and Lane are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Kueng knelt on Floyd's back and Lane knelt and held onto Floyd's legs.
Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Summer art fairs hit pause button: But as art lovers mourn all the pandemic-forced cancellations, a Minneapolis fest bucks the trend.

Full text: Zack and Shannon Steven of Edina normally make sure they attend the Uptown Art Fair. It's a chance to converse with artists, and it often falls on their special day.
"One of the big reasons that we typically go is to find our anniversary gift," said Shannon Steven, an art teacher at Cornelia Elementary in Edina. "It's always been perfect that Uptown Art Fair is on the day or right around it."
This year their marriage turns 20, but their art fair tradition is on pause.
The Twin Cities' summer art fairs are a chance for art lovers to enjoy the sunshine, discover new art and chat with artists face to face. Nearly all of this year's are either canceled or moved online. One exception: the Red Hot Art Festival in Minneapolis. It will operate as a scaled-down version of its pre-pandemic self, with pop-ups the next three Fridays from 4-7 p.m. on Nicollet Avenue near Franklin.
Minnesotans have had to search for new ways to get their summer art fixes. Artists, meanwhile, must make up lost revenue, and fair directors are trying to plan for an uncertain future.
"The art fairs account for sometimes up to 40 percent of my yearly income," said Meg Erke, a mixed-media painting and book artist. "Loring Park and Powderhorn are two I would've done."
Erke skipped the Powderhorn Art Fair's transition to an online two-day event because it charged a $175 fee. She's participated in the fairs for the past eight years. To make up for lost income, she applied for unemployment, decided to sharpen her own online sales platform, and is selling her art at local businesses like Minnesota Makers. She also taught a summer art camp via Zoom.
Artist Jaana Mattson, who makes needle-felted wool landscapes on pieces of wood, traditionally makes most of her income from art fairs. She's been doing them for 20 years, averaging 12 to 18 each year. She was supposed to be a featured artist at St. Anthony Park Arts Festival in St. Paul, but it was canceled.
"Art fairs are a constant cycle of making work in the studio, planning ahead," she said. "With everything stopping in its tracks, I've had a unique opportunity to take a break and re-evaluate a little."
With more downtime, she's been able to work on building online tutorials and figure out how to teach via Zoom.
For art fair directors, the loss is simply devastating.
The Loring Park Art Festival decided not to go online. Now it's trying to plan for 2021.
"We are hopeful that we can have something close to what we've had in the past," said assistant director Cindy Jacobson. Last year, the Loring fair had 140 artists, one-third of them from Minnesota. "We are not sure if we are going to have a bigger footprint in the park. Nobody knows what's going on."
A similar reality hit the Uptown Art Fair, which would've turned 57 last weekend.
"We normally get 380,000 people attending that event over three days," said Jill Osiecki, executive director of the Uptown Association. She estimated that the fair lost "at least tens of thousands of dollars."
For fairgoers like the Stevens, being able to talk with artists is another reason they go. After the killing of George Floyd, they got their artist chats in by talking with mural makers.
"I had a little app [Glide] for tracking George Floyd murals," said Zack Steven, who is also the founder of startup studio Cloudburst SBC. "It was great to see people making things out of tragic situations."
The last fair standing?
Instead of canceling, the community-driven Red Hot Art Festival shifted to a series of pop-ups with a different batch of three or four artists each weekend plus a music act and a kids event.
"Instead of taking community out of it, we figured we could scale it down," said coordinator Mike Brooks. "We were looking for BIPOC artists, sticking to artists that were going to be motivated to do something for the times that we are in."
Last year Red Hot had 170 artists and around 2,000 attendees. Unlike other fairs, it doesn't charge artists to participate.
Like everything in the time of COVID, there will be some standard social distancing and cleanliness rules. For festival executive director Rachel Boeke, the extra cleaning feels worth it, especially now.
"We're allowing people to access art and community for a time when we are lacking that."

Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank filed a motion Wednesday requesting to join the trials of Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. A trial date has been set for March 8.
Frank argued that the charges and evidence against the four are similar, that witnesses and family members "are likely to be traumatized by multiple trials" and that the "interests of justice" necessitate one trial.
"Trying these cases jointly would ensure that the jury understands … all of the evidence and the complete picture of George Floyd's death," Frank wrote. "And it would allow the community and the nation to absorb the verdicts for the four Defendants at once."
Separate trials would cause delays, could taint potential jurors for later trials and would burden the state, court and witnesses, he wrote.
"In the absence of joinder, eyewitnesses and Floyd's family members would be required to relive Floyd's murder at multiple trials," Frank argued. "Requiring victims and witnesses to relive traumatic experiences across seriatim trials is disfavored …"
According to the motion: Minnesota rules of criminal procedure allow joining trials based on the nature of the charges, the impact on the victim, the potential prejudice to the defendant and the "interests of justice."
All four factors apply to the Floyd case, Frank wrote. The COVID-19 pandemic would also put witnesses at risk if they must testify at four trials, as well as Floyd's family members as they travel from out of state, he added.
"The trauma eyewitnesses may suffer when testifying about Floyd's death, moreover, is likely to be even more substantial if defense counsel cross-examines them about, for instance, why they did not try harder to intervene to stop the murder," Frank argued. "In addition to the emotional burden of testifying, witnesses will also face other logistical and financial burdens -- for example, the 'travel costs and lost wages' associated with testifying at four separate trials."
Several key witnesses are minors, the motion said, and are considered "particularly 'vulnerable.' "
Darnella Frazier, a bystander who recorded Floyd's death in a video seen around the world, was 17 at the time. Her 9-year-old cousin also witnessed the incident.
"Ms. Frazier has been publicly shamed for not somehow stopping Defendants and saving Floyd," Frank wrote. "She has been the subject of considerable media scrutiny. And she has begun therapy to cope with the trauma of witnessing Floyd's murder."
The four defenses are not antagonistic, meaning they are not blaming each other, a consideration in joining trials, Frank also argued.
Lane, Kueng and Thao are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Lane and Kueng arrested Floyd on May 25 when they responded to a call about him allegedly using a fake $20 bill at Cup Foods. Thao and Chauvin arrived as backup. Chauvin, Lane and Kueng pressed Floyd stomach-down in the street while Thao kept concerned bystanders at bay.

General Mills vows more Black managers: Golden Valley company commits to doubling their number, taking other steps to increase diversity, support racial equality.

Full text: General Mills said Wednesday it will double the number of Black managers throughout the company, making a public commitment after the police killing of George Floyd thrust more attention on racial injustice and inequality.
The food company's plan, announced Wednesday, reflects a larger reckoning in corporate America over the lack of diverse representation in upper management.
Additionally, the company -- founded in Minneapolis, and now based in Golden Valley -- promised to increase the percentage of racially and ethnically diverse individuals holding professional positions within the company's U.S. offices, currently at 19%, to 25%. It said it will diversify its supply base by doubling what it spends with minority-owned vendors.
Floyd's death and subsequent protests raised awareness of the ways Black Americans are disadvantaged and discriminated against, including economically and professionally. This has led to calls for greater, and quantifiable, representation in boardrooms and senior corporate leadership.
"I want to voice General Mills' strong support for the inspiring movement for social and racial justice that was tragically elevated by the horrible killing of George Floyd here in our hometown of Minneapolis," General Mills' chief executive, Jeff Harmening, told investors earlier this summer.
"We have a lot of work to do to start the healing, to help our communities rebuild, to emphasize that Black lives matter, and to help drive lasting change for social and racial justice," he added.
And while General Mills has set a tangible goal, it stopped short of establishing a deadline by which to meet these commitments.
"It is an ongoing commitment that includes how we recruit, develop and advance, and retain employees," a company spokeswoman said. "We will continue to establish and pursue tangible goals that ensure we build and maintain a diverse workforce."
By contrast, Delta Air Lines on Tuesday made diversity-related public commitments with a self-imposed deadline of 2025.
The company is tying its leadership to its overall employee base. While 21% of its employee base is Black, only 16% of Delta's overall leaders and 7% of its top 100 officers are Black.
"That is not a picture of equity, nor is it reflective of the world we serve," Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees.
Delta aims to double the percentage of Black officers and directors in the next five years and increase Black representation on its board of directors.
While based in Atlanta, Delta often refers to Minneapolis-St. Paul as its second home, including in a company memo expressing outrage over Floyd's death. The company owes much of its legacy and size to the 2008 merger with the former Northwest Airlines, which was based in the Twin Cities.
Both companies made other commitments this week aimed at racial equity. For instance, General Mills is shifting charitable giving to areas that will more greatly benefit communities of color and Delta is broadening its talent recruitment strategy to include more historically Black colleges and universities.

Dakota question artwork process: Tribal members say they were left out of government installation.

Full text: Days before Ramsey County and the city of St. Paul are set to unveil new, more inclusive artwork in historic meeting chambers, some members of the Dakota tribe say they felt left out of the process.
On Tuesday, two Minnesota lawmakers contacted the Ramsey County Board on behalf of members of the Dakota community who said they felt "invisible" and unheard.
"Members of the Dakota community felt they had been left out. They would have liked to have been part of the conversation," said Rep. Mary Kunesh-Podein, DFL-New Brighton. "There are a number of elders and Dakota artists that would have liked to participate in the decisionmaking. We have a very active Dakota artist community."
Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, DFL-Roseville, said she's heard similar criticisms of the project.
Lawmakers said it's important for Dakota people to be part of the process because St. Paul and Ramsey County occupy what was once Dakota land.
Crystal Norcross, board chair of Oyate Hotanin, a St. Paul-based Indigenous arts and social justice nonprofit organization, said the process was not welcoming to Dakota artists. She said Dakota artists' initial concerns that their work would be used as a "Band-aid" to be displayed next to racist historic depictions were dismissed early on, resulting in many Dakota artists choosing not to participate.
"It wasn't inclusive. They didn't want to tell our stories," said Norcross, who lives in St. Paul and is a member of the Sisseton Wapheton Oyate, which is part of the Dakota tribe.
On Tuesday, Ramsey County commissioners said they take the criticism seriously but they ultimately voted unanimously to move ahead with the installation of the four new pieces of art completed by a diverse group of artists, including one northern Minnesota artist with Anishinaabe heritage.
The new artwork will cover all four of the original 1930s murals painted by Chicago artist John Norton depicting larger-than-life images of white men standing over much smaller images of laborers and Native Americans. The original murals underneath will not be damaged or altered.
The new art will be unveiled at a ceremony next week if the St. Paul City Council also gives its approval at Wednesday's meetings.
Ramsey County commissioners said the new artwork is temporary and will eventually be moved to make room for more pieces from an even broader pool of artists.
"I do agree there needs to be continued conversation and the recognition ... that we are on Dakota land," said Ramsey County Board Chair Toni Carter.
In December 2018, leaders in Ramsey County and St. Paul, which share ownership of the historic City Hall and courthouse in downtown St. Paul, agreed to commission new, more diverse artwork to cover some of the four original murals.
After nearly a two-year process run by the Ramsey County Historical Society that included community meetings, a call for artists and extensive interviewing, a citizen task force selected four artists: the Latinx Mural Apprenticeship Project organized by Latino nonprofit CLUES; Emily Donovan of St. Paul; Leah Yellowbird of Grand Rapids, and Adam Swanson, who lives in Cloquet on the Fond du Lac Reservation.
Norcross said members of Oyate Hotanin are upset the new artwork doesn't reflect their Dakota heritage.
"Oyate Dakota people feel once again not heard in the process and further made invisible in this important retelling of the story of St. Paul," according to an e-mail the group sent to Kunesh-Podein and obtained by the Star Tribune.
Norcross said her organization does support other Native American artists but feel strongly that the Dakota need to have artistic representation on the ancestral homeland.
"It feels like we are always fighting for representation all the time on all platforms," Norcross said.
Commissioner Jim McDonough said he attended a forum where Dakota community members did object to early plans to cover up two of the original murals and leave two of the originals on display. The decision to leave some uncovered appeased "historical purists" but upset and offended others, McDonough said. Many decided not to participate further, he said.
"I respected their reasoning," he said.
After the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May, city and county leaders agreed to cover all four of the original murals with new art.
"Our community has really changed since the murder of George Floyd," McDonough said. "They were proven right. It's time now for our community to move on."
McDonough said the unveiling of the new murals next week should be a celebration.
"This is not easy stuff. We learn every time," he said. "But I don't want to stop or slow down this work."

Former cop should stand trial, prosecutors argue: They defend charging Thomas Lane, saying his own words show he understood severity of force used on George Floyd.

Full text: Former Minneapolis police officer Thomas Lane should stand trial as an accomplice to the murder of George Floyd because his actions during Floyd's May 25 arrest meet the legal requirements for the charges against him, and jurors should be allowed to determine whether he is guilty, prosecutors argue in new legal filings.
Lane's actions when he and three other former officers restrained Floyd showed that he recognized they were inflicting harm, and that the senior officer, Derek Chauvin, was violating police training and policies, prosecutors wrote in a brief made public Tuesday.
The prosecutors said that Lane continued to participate in the risky restraint even after Floyd complained that police were killing him.
The fact that Lane had less than a week of experience on the job is no excuse, they continued. "[F]or a host of important reasons, there is no free pass under state law for rookies who choose to disregard their training at the suggestion of a senior officer."
And according to the motion submitted late Monday by Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank and Neal Katyal, a special attorney for the state, Lane had extensive police training before he started the job.
Their comments were meant to refute a motion to dismiss the charges, filed in July by Lane's attorney, Earl Gray. He noted that Lane had been on the job for four days when Floyd was killed, arguing that he bore no liability because he was deferring to Chauvin, a senior officer with 19 years of experience.
Gray noted that Lane had expressed concerns about Floyd's struggles to breathe as the officers pinned him on his stomach in the street. Lane had asked Chauvin about rolling Floyd onto his side but was rebuffed, Gray argued.
"It's not a case where he's standing by watching another cop pound on somebody's head," Gray said in early July. "This is a case where my client twice -- twice -- asked if we should turn him over and the answer from [Chauvin] was no."
Lane and former officer J. Alexander Kueng had responded to Cup Foods on a report that Floyd had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. They detained Floyd as Chauvin and former officer Tou Thao arrived as backup.
Lane, Kueng and Thao are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Chauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Floyd's arrest spiraled out of control when he refused to get into a police cruiser, saying he was claustrophobic. A struggle led to police pinning him to the ground. Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes as Lane and Kueng helped restrain him.
Prosecutors seek to turn Lane's words against him.
"Lane's own comments at that time confirmed that he was aware that Chauvin was intentionally and unjustifiably causing substantial bodily harm to Floyd," they argued.
In the span of a few minutes, they said, Lane had asked about rolling Floyd onto his side as he started to lose consciousness, remarked that Floyd was "passing out," and repeated his question about rolling Floyd onto his side. Lane also asked Kueng if he could find Floyd's pulse, they said.
Chauvin said no to turning Floyd the first time, but no one responded to Lane the second time, prosecutors said.
"Lane did nothing to challenge Chauvin's answer," they continued. "Not one thing. Instead, he remained in the same position, and continued to hold down Floyd's legs with his hands."
They noted that Kueng controlled Floyd's sknees, pressed into his back and held onto his handcuffed left wrist, while Lane continued to hold his legs. Lane, Chauvin and Kueng continued to restrain Floyd even after he lost consciousness and after Kueng was unable to detect a pulse, prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors noted that while Thao kept bystanders at bay, he ignored their pleas to help Floyd.
The prosecutors argued that Lane knew Floyd was restrained in an "inherently dangerous" position, was unresponsive and, at some point, had no pulse.
Minneapolis police policy prohibits using neck restraints on people who are "passively resisting" or not resisting. It also requires officers to intervene when force is being used inappropriately, prosecutors said. They said Lane's comments about rolling Floyd onto his side show that he remembered his training and that he knew the neck restraint was unjustified.
Before losing consciousness, Floyd told the officers he couldn't breathe more than 20 times, called out for his deceased mother about a dozen times and pleaded with Chauvin, "I can't breathe. Please, your knee in my neck."
Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, has filed a motion to dismiss the charges as legally deficient.
Prosecutors have not yet responded formally, but in their motion in Lane's case, they noted that Thao had continued to stand watch and rebuff bystanders as Floyd lay dying. At some point, an off-duty Minneapolis firefighter happened upon the scene and offered medical assistance.
Thao shouted, "Back off," and Lane ordered the firefighter to get back "on the sidewalk," the prosecutors wrote in the motion filed in Lane's case. The officers also ignored her pleas for them to begin chest compressions on Floyd after they learned he had no pulse, they said.
A judge will hear arguments on Lane's and Thao's motions at a Sept. 11 hearing. A trial is scheduled for March 8.

Court releases bodycam videos in Floyd case: A coalition of media companies had sought release of footage of George Floyd's killing to the general public.

Full text: Two body-worn camera videos from the day George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police were publicly released Monday by the court after a coalition of media companies intervened and argued for their unrestrained release.
The move comes more than a month after a defense attorney filed the two videos with the court as part of a motion, which makes them public data under state law. The court initially withheld them out of concern that it might taint the jury pool, then allowed them to be viewed by appointment.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill issued an order Friday changing his position on the videos recorded by former officers J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane and allowing their broad release. The judge wrote in his order that a memorandum explaining his decision would be filed at a later date.
The media coalition seeking access to the videos included the Star Tribune; American Public Media, which owns Minnesota Public Radio; the Associated Press; CBS Broadcasting Inc.; Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal; Hubbard Broadcasting, which owns KSTP-TV; and the New York Times Co., among others.
Minneapolis lawyer Leita Walker, who represents the coalition, argued the matter at a hearing before Cahill in late July. The judge took the issue under advisement at the time.
Attorney Earl Gray had filed the two videos with the court on July 7 to support his motion to dismiss the criminal charges against Lane, his client.
By appointment last month, the Star Tribune viewed both videos, which totaled about 65 minutes. The footage showed that Floyd was given no explanation for why he was being questioned before Lane pointed a gun and swore at him, touched him multiple times and forced him out of his vehicle into the street.
Kueng and Lane had responded to a convenience store on May 25 on a report that Floyd had allegedly used a fake $20 bill. Their former colleagues, Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin, later showed up to assist.
Before Cahill released the videos, someone leaked portions of them to the Daily Mail, a British media company, which published them online Aug. 3. The leak is under investigation.
Lane, Kueng and Thao are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Chauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Prosecutors have said Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 8 minutes, but Kueng's video showed that it was about 9 minutes and 30 seconds.

ELECTION 2020: MINNESOTA PRIMARY: FLOYD'S DEATH LOOMS LARGE IN DFL BATTLES

Full text: Antone Melton-Meaux recalls his days at the University of Virginia where police detained him for three hours based on reports that a man wanted for assault had run into his apartment building.
Ilhan Omar talks about being bullied as a Muslim refugee and raising a Black son in Minneapolis, where she wants him to grow up and thrive.
Jeff Hayden tells the story of learning to cross the street as a young boy in south Minneapolis, his mother leaning over to tell him to watch out for the police.
The three candidates, all in contested DFL primaries Tuesday, are talking about their experiences being Black in America and the feeling that they could have just as easily been pinned under the knee of a police officer, much like George Floyd. But in a period of reckoning for their party and the nation as a whole, they're also contrasting their ideas on police reform and racial inequality, issues that have fueled several primaries in the city where Floyd died, particularly the contest between Omar and Melton-Meaux.
The race in Minneapolis' Fifth Congressional District, the most diverse in the state, has divided civil rights leaders in the wake of Floyd's killing. In the Minnesota Legislature, Hayden represents the district where Floyd was killed and has become a key figure in the legislative debate over the future of policing. But he's fighting for his political survival after losing the DFL endorsement to activist Omar Fateh, who has challenged the strength of his support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
The moral resonance of Floyd's death also looms in another contested primary involving four-term state Rep. Raymond Dehn. A former mayoral contender, Dehn has long been an advocate for criminal justice reform in the city. But his challenger, activist Esther Agbaje, argued that the struggle needs new blood as she wrestled the party endorsement away from Dehn.
The three urban primaries, among the few truly competitive DFL contests for state or congressional seats, could serve as harbingers of the party's post-Floyd future.
"Public safety has moved to one of, if not the top priority," said Fateh, who is challenging Hayden in Minneapolis' Senate District 62. "It left a lot of people afraid and upset. What we saw was a lot of neighbors rally together to take public safety into their own hands."
While the candidates espouse the same goals, the solutions they offer have distinct differences.
Omar worked on legislation in the U.S. House that banned chokeholds and no-knock warrants and eliminated qualified immunity for officers in the wake of Floyd's killing. She supports the push in the Minneapolis City Council to replace the city's police force with a new community safety agency.
"Many attempts to reform the Police Department have failed and it's time to really think about having a new system that would allow our communities to do the work that is needed," she said. "Most of the problems we have in our city are arising from things like substance abuse disorder, mental health diagnoses and poverty that requires medical professionals and social workers, not criminal enforcement and armed officers."
Omar's got the backing of people such as Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins and Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, a Black man who was shot and killed in 2016 by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights. "She marched with us in 2016, she marched with us after the murder of George Floyd," said Castile of Omar. "She has listened to us and worked with us."
Melton-Meaux doesn't support dismantling the Police Department, but he agrees more funding should be moved from law enforcement to community services. His platform pushes to demilitarize police, end qualified immunity for officers and change the legal definitions for use of force.
His supporters, like civil rights activists Josie Johnson and Nekima Levy Armstrong, argue their support for him goes beyond policy positions. It touches on a key theme of his campaign: that Omar, a rising star and member of "the Squad" in Congress, is more concerned about her national profile than the needs of the district.
"I'm in touch with people on a regular basis who feel as if they are being neglected by the powers that be," said Levy Armstrong. "Understanding our needs is critical of the person who is going to represent us in Congress. Someone who is going to spend the time listening to what we need and not just talking and giving rhetoric."
Both sides are on the attack in the contentious race, which has attracted millions of dollars from outside of the district. Melton-Meaux is critical of Omar for launching a virtual book tour the day after Floyd was killed in May instead of being with protesters at the corner of 38th and Chicago. "She was promoting her own celebrity and brand and not the people," he said.
Omar said she finds Melton-Meaux's insinuation "offensive." Her father was also battling COVID-19 at the same time and later died. Her supporters say she was frequently at the memorial and helping communities hit by civil unrest. They also have criticized Melton-Meaux for a 2015 Star Tribune op-ed that called out protesters' anti-police chants as he argued that the movement needed to create a bigger tent. Melton-Meaux defends the commentary, saying he wrote the piece to help the movement grow and build collaborations.
Tensions over policing and the Black Lives Matter movement also have extended to Hayden's race, where Fateh has criticized the incumbent for past backing from the controversial Minneapolis police union. Hayden said an erroneous endorsement was put on his website alongside those of other unions. He denies that he's accepted the police union's backing.
Fateh supports the push to radically reimagine policing in the city and the state, and said Hayden hasn't been a present leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. But Hayden said his experience of more than a decade at the State Capitol has helped him build connections necessary to bring resources back to the district, which still suffers the scars of properties burned, looted and vandalized after Floyd's death.
Dehn is also reminding his constituents how long he's been pushing for criminal justice reform in his primary race in north Minneapolis' House District 59B, including a campaign to restore voting rights for felons.
As a 2017 candidate for mayor, Dehn took heat for questioning how police officers are armed and trained. Now, he's happy the conversation has broken into the mainstream. "I think a lot of things changed for a lot of people when they saw the killing of George Floyd," he said.
But Agbaje, an attorney and DFL activist, secured the party's backing over Dehn this spring, arguing it's time for a changing of the guard. She said the Legislature has had years to pass criminal justice accountability measures, and it's never been more critical than in the time of COVID-19, when Black people are disproportionately affected.
"We need to move urgently on this," she said. "All of this is just another point in time for us to look critically, and look carefully and make some real changes."

Full text: Joan Gabel juggled more crises in her first year leading the University of Minnesota than some college presidents face in their entire tenure.
She closed the U's five campuses and oversaw the school's first-ever shift to remote learning when the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in Minnesota this past spring. She severed some of the university's contracts with Minneapolis police after the death of George Floyd. And she threw her support behind a lawsuit against a since-rescinded federal rule that could have subjected many international students to deportation.
Her inaugural year as president of Minnesota's flagship university has been a crash course in crisis management. So far, the verdict on the U's first female president has been largely positive -- despite a couple of episodes that prompted backlash from students and the U's governing board. Gabel has won praise from students, faculty and regents for her decisive leadership in steering the school through a pandemic and the aftermath of social unrest that rocked the Twin Cities. Many of her biggest decisions were made from behind a webcam at the president's Eastcliff residence, her base of operations for the past five months.
"It was a tough year, without question," said Gabel, who dons a maroon and gold mask when she's out and about. "There is so much uncertainty around everything going on right now."
Some of Gabel's choices have been met with calls for her to better consult the U's Board of Regents. In March, she was accused of shortchanging students when she proposed a flat room and board refund for those who had to move off campus midsemes
ter because of the pandemic. She promptly reversed course and offered prorated refunds, which regents signed off on.
In June, Gabel announced the U would reopen to students this fall. About a month later, school officials revealed 70% of classes would be taught online. Some students and regents accused leaders of false advertising.
"They say one thing and then the next week they say something different," Regent Michael Hsu said. "They're kind of losing credibility in terms of being on top of things."
Regent Ken Powell, chairman of the board, countered that Gabel's flexibility is an asset: "Sometimes people just dig in. We don't see her as like that."
Gabel described her leadership approach during the pandemic as being rooted in flexibility. As she enters her second year, she knows she may have to quickly pivot to keep students and faculty safe and her institution afloat.
Leading with values
Since taking over as the university's 17th president in July 2019, Gabel has built a reputation as a kind and collaborative leader.
Amy Pittenger, who was the U's Faculty Senate leader until June 30, said Gabel's values were on full display at the onset of the pandemic.
She froze tuition for most students. When the campuses shut down in March, Gabel chose to pay student workers through the semester, even if they could not continue work remotely. Housing and dining services stayed open for students who had nowhere else to go.
Gabel has not asked faculty to do anything she herself would not do, Pittenger said. While faculty will be furloughed to help offset losses from the pandemic, Gabel and members of her cabinet will take a 10% pay cut. Gabel also let faculty members choose whether to teach online or in person this fall.
"She really involved faculty in ways that really surpassed my hopes," Pittenger said.
Just as Gabel put the stressful spring semester behind her, a new crisis arose: the death of George Floyd, a Black man, under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.
Then student body President Jael Kerandi wrote a letter to Gabel demanding the school cut ties with the department. Gabel announced the next day the U would no longer contract with Minneapolis police for large events, such as football games, and would limit collaboration to "joint patrols and investigations."
The decision was a statement that "enough was enough," Gabel said. She was dean of the University of Missouri's business school when Michael Brown, a Black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. And she became provost of the University of South Carolina just months after a white supremacist murdered nine Black worshipers at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.
"I have this strange and sad but real experience with social unrest, racial unrest occurring right outside the gates of the campus in which I worked," Gabel said.
To Kerandi, the swift decision showed that Gabel wanted Black students to know "their lives matter." To critics, the move was yet another example of Gabel not consulting the U's governing board.
"I think to rush to a decision of that magnitude … I wish they would have taken more time to make it," said Sen. Paul Anderson, a Republican from Plymouth who chairs the Senate Higher Education Committee.
More challenges await
Gabel's second year begins with what is perhaps her biggest gamble yet: reopening the University of Minnesota amid a rising number of COVID-19 cases in the state.
Dormitories will open under reduced capacity, classrooms and common spaces will be restructured and students must wear masks on campus. But Gabel knows the school ultimately will not be able to control students' behavior.
"My worry is that people would not stay safe and healthy, and that as a consequence of that people would be ill … and it would affect our ability to function as an institution," Gabel said.
Gabel has plenty of other work to do, too. She is planning a virtual launch this fall of a student mental health partnership with the Minnesota State college system. She also will revive the debate over renaming campus buildings when she brings a new policy proposal to regents in the coming months.
Next spring might not be any easier. The university will pitch its two-year budget request to state lawmakers as they grapple with a potential $4.7 billion deficit. If that deficit holds, Minnesota colleges could be in for a "rude awakening," Anderson said. Not only are you going to not receive status quo money, you're going to receive some significant cuts."
Former U President Eric Kaler said Gabel is facing a "once in a lifetime" crisis that may require her to chart a new path to financial sustainability and reconsider how many classes are taught on campus.
"Even if we can come back together, are we going to want to?" said Kaler, who will teach chemical engineering remotely this fall.
Regent Powell said he trusts Gabel can handle whatever challenges emerge. He noted that she completed a systemwide strategic plan on time despite the demands of pandemic planning.
"I think we know that there is an opportunity to get a lot done at the university over the next several years," Powell said.

Even to friends, Chauvin was an enigma in blue: Driven to be a cop, he spent 19 years on the streets. "I don't know what happened to him," former colleague said.

Full text: The world met Derek Chauvin, staring ahead impassively with his knee on George Floyd's neck, through a bystander's cellphone video shot as sunlight waned on Memorial Day in south Minneapolis.
Yet in the nearly two decades before Floyd's death prompted worldwide outrage, Chauvin was a face in the crowd, patrolling the streets during night shifts in the city's busy Third Precinct. Now charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's killing, the 44-year-old fired Minneapolis police officer remains an enigma to colleagues and neighbors, and at least one family member who described being horrified by the video and said Chauvin's behavior was out of character.
"The number one question I had was, 'Why didn't you just get up?' " said the relative, who asked not to be named over safety concerns.
Chauvin's family is struggling to square the Chauvin they know with the man whose actions have sparked worldwide condemnation and demands for change.
Next-door neighbors say they barely saw Chauvin, discovering he was a cop only when reporters and protesters showed up in their Oakdale neighborhood. Former colleagues are confounded by how the unassuming veteran street cop became the city's most notorious officer.
"He's not the devil that he's made out to be," said Sgt. Joey Sandberg, who retired in 2018 after working three decades in the large Third Precinct that spreads across south Minneapolis. Sandberg called Chauvin a friend. "I don't know what happened to him. Nobody knows. That's the million-dollar question."
Chauvin is in custody at a state prison in Oak Park Heights. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment.
'A regular guy'
Chauvin's work record details commendations for disarming gang members and intervening during domestic-abuse calls. Before pressing his knee into Floyd's neck on May 25, Chauvin was also involved in two other deadly encounters with civilians and two nonfatal police shootings. Yet the 19-year veteran was disciplined just once out of 17 misconduct complaints logged since 2001.
Chauvin had an ordinary, middle-class upbringing in the St. Paul area, the relative said. His father is a certified public accountant. His mother stayed home to raise their children. They divorced when Chauvin was young.
After graduating from Park High School in Cottage Grove in 1994, Chauvin earned a certificate in quantity food preparation at Dakota County Technical College and worked jobs as a prep cook at a McDonald's and a south metro buffet restaurant. Then he attended Inver Hills Community College and Metropolitan State University, where his focus shifted to police work.
Chauvin entered active service in the U.S. Army and did two stints in military police: in Rochester in 1997, and in Hohenfels, Germany, in 1999 and 2000. Jerry Obieglo, a former platoon sergeant stationed in Germany with Chauvin, remembers him as laser-focused on studying to become a police officer. Chauvin didn't go out drinking and instead volunteered to be the designated driver.
"He was a regular guy, didn't stand out, did his job, kept his uniform clean and kept his equipment accounted for," Obieglo said. "I had no complaints."
On patrol
Chauvin joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2001. Within five years he was recommended for a Medal of Valor following the shooting death of Wayne Reyes, a stabbing suspect who fled in his truck with officers in pursuit. Police said Reyes pointed a shotgun toward Chauvin and five other officers. The officers all fired on Reyes, killing him.
Chauvin's one disciplinary action came in 2007 from a Minneapolis woman he had stopped on her way home from a grocery run. The woman alleged that Chauvin had pulled her over for going 10 mph over the speed limit, frisked her and put her in his squad car. Chauvin got a letter of reprimand for his handling of the stop and for not turning on his recording equipment.
A year later, Chauvin shot Ira Latrell Toles in the abdomen after responding to a 911 domestic-abuse call. According to an internal review, Chauvin later told investigators that he had tried to hit Toles in the head with the butt of his handgun because Toles failed to comply with commands to get on the ground. Chauvin said he shot Toles when he thought Toles reached for his gun. Toles' ex-girlfriend reported that Chauvin fired his gun "about two seconds" after he entered the bathroom.
"If he was reprimanded for shooting me, then maybe more lives could have been saved," Toles said in a recent interview.
Kristofer Bergh, now 24, was a high school senior in 2013 when he and some friends were driving home in south Minneapolis after school. They'd been playing a team Nerf-gun game, and one of his friends fired a dart out the car window. Seconds later, as they pulled up to Bergh's home, Bergh said he turned to see a police car and two officers -- one identified as Chauvin -- coming at them.
One had "his gun drawn on me," Bergh said. It's unclear which officer drew his gun. Bergh said they yelled obscenities and demanded to know who fired the Nerf dart; they stuck his friend in the squad and berated him.
Another complaint was filed by Lasean Braddock, a former St. Paul resident now living in Chicago. Braddock, 48, said police stopped him as he drove home in 2013 from a double shift as a mental health worker at Hennepin County Medical Center. One of the officers was identified as Chauvin.
Braddock said he suspected they had mistaken him for someone who had been using his name. Braddock said the officer at his driver's window, later identified by his lawyer as Chauvin, began hitting the glass with his flashlight when he hesitated to get out of the car. Braddock said the officers tried to force him to the pavement. He went down on his own to avoid injury.
Although the identity mix-up was somehow resolved at the jail, Braddock said, they booked him for failing to comply with police orders and resisting arrest. Prosecutors ultimately tossed the case.
Hennepin County Assistant Public Defender Jordan Deckenbach said Braddock was stopped on a bad warrant. The case was dismissed after the City Attorney's Office watched the squad car video, he said. The aggression was "routine" for the Third Precinct then, he said, but Braddock's case stuck out "because Chauvin went from zero to 60."
Braddock said he's still angry and was not surprised to learn that the officer at his car window that night was Chauvin. To Braddock, Chauvin was "running around like a loose cannon."
Living large
Chauvin's status today as an instantly recognizable flash point in U.S. police-community relations is belied by the unremarkable profile colleagues say he cut during nearly two decades on the Minneapolis force.
Lucy Gerold, a retired Third Precinct commander, remembers Chauvin as a hard charger who liked to keep busy. She said she never thought he was overly aggressive.
"If I had that sense, I know that I would have been working with his brass to intervene," Gerold said.
Chauvin's peers said he rarely opened up about his personal life, which is now under scrutiny by Washington County prosecutors. They allege that Chauvin and his wife, Kellie, skirted state tax laws for at least five years.
Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce after Chauvin's arrest in Floyd's death, and she is seeking to change her last name. The court sealed the case, citing privacy and safety concerns. A media coalition that includes the Star Tribune has protested the sealing in a pending motion to intervene.
The two met during one of Chauvin's shifts, when Kellie worked at HCMC. They married in 2010. Kellie Chauvin, a refugee from Laos whose family moved to the Midwest in the 1980s, had earlier left an arranged marriage that turned abusive. She would later tell the St. Paul Pioneer Press that "under all that uniform," Derek Chauvin was "just a softie."
The couple owned and rented two homes in Woodbury between 2014 and 2017 before buying their Oakdale home for more than $260,000. They also bought a townhouse near Orlando, Fla., for $210,900 in 2011. Derek Chauvin is registered to vote in Florida.
In July, Washington County prosecutors charged both Derek and Kellie Chauvin with nine counts each of aiding and abetting tax evasion and tax fraud. According to the criminal complaint, the couple failed to report $464,433 in Minnesota income over five years and failed to pay $37,868 in taxes owed during that time.
The complaint also accuses the Chauvins of using their Florida address in 2018 to register a BMW X5 they bought for more than $100,000 in Minnetonka. They kept the car in Minnesota, where it was serviced, while not paying more than $5,000 in taxes for it, the complaint says.
'I saw both sides of him'
After his police shifts, Chauvin worked security for bars and restaurants, making $220 to $250 a night -- money Washington County prosecutors now say was not fully reported as income from 2014 to 2019.
Maya Santamaria, former owner of the El Nuevo Rodeo nightclub where Chauvin worked for many years, described him as a "mellow" guy who didn't talk much about himself. But he was also quick to get aggressive, she said, especially on events that El Nuevo Rodeo marketed to attract Black customers.
"I saw both sides of him," Santamaria said. "Pepper spraying everybody, sometimes using holds that were not apparently the most legal of holds, getting freaked out if there were a lot of Black clientele in our club and needing backup right away for no apparent reason."
Several people interviewed for this story noted that Chauvin chose to remain on his intense patrol beat much longer than most officers do. That can affect someone, they said.
"Nineteen years on the street is a long time, period," said former MPD Chief Jane Harteau. "And 19 years in mostly the same place on the same shift is too long."
In footage of Floyd's final moments alive, Chauvin appears to lose his cool only when onlookers moved toward him as he knelt on Floyd's neck.
"Don't come over here! Don't come over here!" Chauvin shouted as he pulled out his pepper spray. He quickly stowed it as another officer stepped in to fend off the crowd.
As Floyd yelled out for his mother and said he couldn't breathe, Chauvin replied: "You're doing lots of talking. A lot of yelling. It takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to say that."
Chauvin's relative told the Star Tribune that they couldn't finish the video in one sitting. It was too hard.
Obieglo -- Chauvin's old platoon sergeant and a reference on his application with MPD -- realized the officer in the bystander video was Chauvin only when he stood, walking as if he were still deployed back in Germany.
"As my old Bible teacher used to say, the road to Hell was paved with good intentions. And I think old Derek was on the highway to Hell when he did what he did."

GARDENS THAT GIVE: A CARING CROP OF GARDENERS

Full text: This has been a year like no other. First, Minnesotans faced the challenges of a global pandemic and stay-at-home order. Then the world was rocked by the killing of George Floyd and the civic unrest and time of reckoning on racial injustice that followed.
In this extraordinary summer, the Star Tribune's annual Beautiful Gardens contest is different, too. This year, we asked readers to nominate gardens that are beautiful in spirit, with a mission that benefits the greater community.
Reader response was overwhelming. We received more than 360 nominations this year. We read deeply touching descriptions of gardens that have impacted people in countless ways. We would like to offer a heartfelt thank-you to all our readers who took the time to nominate a garden this year.
With so many diverse gardens to understand and appreciate, it was challenging to choose just a few winners. A panel of four judges reviewed the submissions, and ultimately narrowed the field to a few gardens that we will highlight in the coming months.
You'll see and read more about these gardens and the people who tend them in upcoming issues of the Sunday Homes section and online at startribune.com.
1. Kenny Turck, Forest City, Minn.
Turck's home and garden near the farm where he grew up is ground zero for the Dirt Group, a nonprofit he founded to help youths learn, thrive and recover from early trauma by growing food together.
A social worker, Turck is passionate about food access, food security and its importance to health and well-being. In his home, a former church parish, there's a large kitchen in the basement where he teaches canning and food preservation. This year, with the pandemic and limited in-person interaction, the Dirt Group delivered kits to help youths grow food for their households.
2. Olivia Nienaber, Scandia
At her family's farm, Nienaber, 17, has created gardens that give back to wildlife. Her goal is to improve the environment for early-migrating birds, as well as create a more diverse habitat. Every plant must provide food, shelter or cover to birds, hummingbirds, bees, butterflies or moths.
She transformed a formerly weed-filled area near the garage into a variety of native wildflowers, grasses and shrubs. With the help of her family, she also revitalized two small ponds to ensure that wildlife had sources of water, has built birdhouses and feeders and helped build brush piles so that birds and small mammals have a place to hide and raise their young.
3. Bethany Husby, Roseville
Husby tends a large garden and pond at her home, where she divides hundreds of plants every year, recruits volunteers and holds a plant sale to benefit a charitable organization. Inspired by a trip to Tanzania and the people she met there, she and her husband started a nonprofit, Heart to Care, to build a school in Tanzania. This year's sale raised $54,000 for the school, which is now under construction.
4a. Harmony Neal, St. Paul; 4b. Devin Brown, Minneapolis
Harmony Neal, a writer, teacher and laid-off restaurant server during the pandemic, decided to use their extra time to grow food for the neighborhood. Neal transformed the boulevard in front of their rented triplex on a busy corner into Giving Gardens, where the veggies, fruit, herbs and edible flowers are free to all.
After reading about projected food shortages and the closing of grocery stores damaged during the unrest after the George Floyd killing, Devin Brown was inspired to turn her north Minneapolis yard into a food source for her neighbors. With help from volunteers for Growers Unite Minneapolis, Brown created a vegetable garden on the boulevard and another near the alley, where neighbors can help themselves to fresh produce.
5. Andy Lapham, Minneapolis
At his home at 36th and Chicago and on the vacant lot next door, Lapham has created a permaculture demonstration site, where he grows and propagates fruit trees and berry vines and also raises chickens. He built a bench next to the sidewalk that has become a community giveaway spot, where people leave food to share with neighbors in need. Lapham also redesigned and tends a community veggie and fruit garden at a nearby school where neighbors are welcome to pick the produce.
6. Christina and Stephen McHenry, Minneapolis
After the pandemic ended the live music concerts that their family previously enjoyed, the McHenrys began hosting social-distance concerts in their garden, where neighbors can connect, enjoy music and help support musicians who have lost income as a result of the pandemic.
The couple and their children also have an organic vegetable garden and keep chickens, sharing the veggies and the eggs with their neighbors in the Lynn-Lake neighborhood.

Full text: Starting the week of Aug. 17, the city of Minneapolis will begin to reopen 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, the intersection where George Floyd was killed and which has become a memorial site for victims of police violence.
City employees told neighborhood leaders in a meeting Thursday that they would start to reopen 38th Street, said Carmen Means, executive director of the Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization. Council Member Andrea Jenkins, who represents the area, confirmed that and said city employees are talking with community members about how it would be done.
The city has yet to offer details on reopening the street to traffic, though Means said Chicago Avenue would remain blocked off for the time being. A memorial in the middle of the intersection, featuring a large sculpture of a raised fist, would have to be relocated, she said.
The intersection is barricaded by concrete blocks, with people only able to enter on foot. It is filled with art and writings honoring Floyd and other Black people killed by police.
A few businesses in the area have restarted. Cup Foods, the convenience store whose 911 call led to Floyd's death, reopened Monday despite opposition from demonstrators.
The intersection has also begun to earn a reputation for rising crime, including fatal shootings. Jenkins has questioned the apparent reluctance of officers to enter past the barricades, saying it has been referred to as a "no-go zone" by the police.
Jenkins said she recognized the intersection was a "sensitive area" and that she wanted to make sure it remained a site for memorials and gatherings.
"There is a desire to understand what are the visions that the community sees as justice, and then to begin to work on those things in order to go into moving forward with progress," she said.
Neighbors have patrolled the intersection in an attempt to keep it calm, Means said.
"We do understand that safety is a must, that safety shouldn't even have to be asked for," she said. "However, justice is a must. We too shouldn't have to ask for that, but we have to demand it."
Residents who have occupied what they call the "George Floyd Square Zone" sent the city a list of demands they want enacted before the barricades are removed. They include recalling Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, requiring officers to have private liability insurance and allocating funding for residents and businesses in the area.
"Right now this busy intersection is the one piece of protest that a lot of folks deemed necessary in order for justice to be served," Means said.
Next month, the City Council will consider giving Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th streets the commemorative name of "George Perry Floyd Jr. Place."

PROBLEM SOLVERS: NEW FUND FOR TRAUMATIC TIMES

Author: Rosenblum, Gail

Full text: In her more than 25 years working in education and youth development, Danielle Grant said she's always been amazed by the resilience, creativity and positivity of Minneapolis' young people. But the president and CEO of AchieveMpls acknowledges that the past several months -- defined by abrupt educational shifts and the economic fallout of COVID-19, as well as the traumatizing death of George Floyd -- have tested the limits of even the most resilient Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) students. In response, AchieveMpls has launched the MPS Student Support Fund to offer mental health counseling, school-based programs and interventions to let students know how deeply they are valued.
Q: After George Floyd's killing, what needs arose among young people you serve?
A: I think what happened was a lot of different things coming together. Following all of the challenges of life during a pandemic -- including months of distance learning and social isolation, the murder of George Floyd and the ensuing unrest in our community -- more and more people began to understand that our Minneapolis children and youth have significant needs, and they wanted to help. We began to get calls and e-mails about how to donate money for immediate needs, such as food, but also how to help students with their social-emotional needs. The new support fund (achievempls.org) provides some immediate needs support, but is primarily about ongoing support.
Q: How much is in the fund and where is it coming from?
A: So far we have received approximately $54,000. The money has come from small donations, as well as a generous $50,000 grant from the Cargill Foundation. AchieveMpls holds the fund in our role as the nonprofit foundation for Minneapolis Public Schools, but it is administered by staff at MPS who understand the specific needs of our students and school communities. They will determine the specific use of the fund to best support the safety, care and social-emotional well-being of our students.
Q: Students across the district?
A: Yes, this is a districtwide fund that will serve all MPS students. Students across the community have been impacted in so many different ways by the murder of Mr. Floyd. While some students have seen the impacts directly in their neighborhoods, others are impacted less directly but still have questions and need help dealing with their emotions. I'm also excited to see so many of our high school students mobilized to activism, and we will be looking to them to generate ideas on how to make our school district and community better.
Q: Did students come to you to share their distress, or were you hearing more from the adults in their lives?
A: Our team works with thousands of MPS students through our Career & College Centers in 11 high schools, so we've been hearing their stories firsthand and providing as much support as possible during these past several weeks and months. This spring, like everyone else, we transitioned from in-person support to connecting remotely via phone, e-mail, online video chats and other online tools. Students shared the challenges they were navigating through the pandemic, and then their grief and trauma over George Floyd's murder and the ensuing unrest. In addition, we were contacted by concerned parents and community members who wanted to know how they could be a part of financially supporting efforts to help young people process their feelings and heal. And MPS teachers and other school staff were also taking on their own fundraising efforts to help their students. So we believe that the new fund provides a good structure to manage and distribute all of these donations.
Q: With MPS planning to go online-only until November, do you have the stamina to keep going at this high level?
A: Fortunately or unfortunately, we have all become much more adept at communicating and meeting online through Zoom, MS Teams, Google Hangouts or Google Classroom. We're confident that we will be able to adapt opportunities to allow for social distancing.
Q: How has your esteemed STEP-UP program fared this summer?
A: The Step Up Youth Employment Program, a partnership of AchieveMpls with the city of Minneapolis, Career Force Minneapolis and Project for Pride in Living, also had to pivot and redesign how to deliver workforce readiness training. We've done that through virtual internships, paid summer online training and mentoring opportunities. Fully 1,800 Minneapolis youth completed Step Up work readiness training this year, with 450 now doing internships at 61 companies and 1,000 participating in a five-week, paid Summer Online Learning Program. But our mission remains the same, to rally community support to inspire and equip Minneapolis students for careers, college and life.
Q: What's the message you want young people to hear during this tumultuous time?
A: That their community cares about them. We have their backs. I want youth to know that so many people are coming together to help them during these truly difficult times. It is pretty amazing and inspiring to see how many people care, even while they are dealing with their own difficult challenges with COVID-19. We may be socially distanced, but people still want to unite to help others however they can.

Mpls. cop sued over alleged shove: The incident occurred near the George Floyd memorial site.

Full text: A Minneapolis man has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit claiming he was shoved to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer after he asked the officer why the police were not arresting a suspected white supremacist who had smashed a window at Cup Foods, the site of the George Floyd memorial in south Minneapolis.
Andrew Browne, who lives near the memorial, alleges that officer Nicholas Sciorrotta Jr. pushed him down without warning on June 26. The officer was initially not identified in the suit, filed on July 13. But he was named in an amended complaint, which was filed Wednesday.
Sam Kramer, Browne's attorney, said in an interview that he could not disclose how he learned the identity of the officer because of a protective order issued July 22. The order, signed by U.S. Magistrate Judge Hildy Bowbeer, makes some information in the case confidential.
The Minneapolis police referred questions about the incident to the city attorney's office. Acting City Attorney Eric Nilsson did not respond to messages and has not filed a response in court.
According to the lawsuit, Browne lives a block from Cup Foods at E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue. Floyd was killed outside the store May 25 when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes in the presence of three other officers. Floyd's death provoked large protests in the Twin Cities and around the world. Chauvin was charged with second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter and the other officers were charged as accomplices; all have been fired.
The suit alleges that on June 26, Browne was helping a group of volunteers who were providing security at the memorial in front of the store. He alleges he saw the volunteers leading a burly white man away from the memorial after that man had reportedly thrown something through the window of Cup Foods and was threatening people in the area. Brown surmised from the white man's tattoos that he was probably a white supremacist, according to the suit.
Someone called a police dispatcher, who told them to take the man away from the area to meet police, but none showed. After several calls, a dispatcher told the group to release the man. Eventually the volunteers saw about six Minneapolis officers at the corner of W. 39th Street and Park Avenue, including Sciorrotta.
Browne says in the lawsuit that he asked the officers why they had taken so long to respond. The officers said nothing and returned to their squad cars, the suit says.
"Sciorrotta quickly turned, stepped toward Browne and forcefully shoved him, knocking him to the ground," the suit says. Browne "was hurt physically and mentally," the suit alleges. In an interview, Kramer declined to offer details of the injuries.

SBA steps in to aid victims of Floyd riots

Full text: The Small Business Administration (SBA) is offering disaster loans of up to $2 million to businesses and residents in the Twin Cities who incurred financial damage from the protests and riots in late May and early June.
The move comes after the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied a request from Gov. Tim Walz for federal disaster aid to reimburse local governments as they begin to clear away rubble and rebuild structures.
Meanwhile, state and local officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul have been slow to pull together financial assistance, in part because they're waiting to see what the other will do.
Nearly 1,500 Twin Cities businesses were damaged by vandalism, fire and looting that happened after protests over the police killing of George Floyd. Estimates of damage exceed $500 million.
The SBA said it will offer low-interest loans repayable over as long as 30 years for working capital and to repair damage that happened from May 27 to June 8. The agency will accept loan applications until early October.
"Businesses and private nonprofit organizations may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace disaster damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory, and other business assets," Brian McDonald, the SBA's Minnesota district director, said in a statement.
For small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives, and most private nonprofits, SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans to help meet working capital needs. They are available regardless of whether the business suffered physical property damage. Homeowners and renters who incurred related damage are eligible for loans of up to $40,000.
Interest rates are as low as 3% for businesses, 2.75% for nonprofit organizations and 1.25% for homeowners and renters with terms up to 30 years. Loan amount and terms are based on each applicant's financial condition.
Hundreds of small businesses on E. Lake Street, W. Broadway and University Avenue in St. Paul that were torched and looted in the days following Floyd's death remain shuttered.
Kaltuma Hassan, who stood in July in the wreckage of her grocery store on the South Side in Minneapolis, wondered how she could rebuild. Like her neighbors, Hassan was frustrated by the failure of state lawmakers to pass legislation that would have put much-needed cash in the hands of struggling business owners.
"If they want to help us, what are they waiting for?" asked Hassan, who won't be able to rebuild Bismillah Grocery and Coffee without assistance because her insurance policy would cover just $100,000 of her $500,000 loss. "It makes you angry. It is destroying our chance."
Democrats have proposed giving small business owners as much as $300 million to cover uninsured damage, but Republicans have opposed the legislation, citing concerns over the size of the bailout as well as the role Minneapolis officials, accused of being slow to respond as demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in police hands turned to riots. Some key Republican leaders won't support the rebuilding effort unless local officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul contribute to the program.
SBA loans of up to $200,000 are also available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate, and homeowners and renters are eligible for loans up to $40,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property, according to the SBA.
The SBA made the loans available in response to a request from Walz for a disaster declaration by the agency. The declaration covers Hennepin County and the adjacent counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Ramsey, Scott, Sherburne and Wright.
The SBA's Virtual Disaster Loan Outreach Center will help prospective recipients apply online through the SBA's secure website at disaster loanassistance.sba.gov.

Full text: Minneapolis voters won't get to decide the fate of the city's Police Department this year.
In a 10-5 vote, the Minneapolis Charter Commission decided Wednesday to block a controversial policing proposal from the November ballot by invoking its right to take more time to review it.
"We have an obligation to make sure that what is going on the ballot gives the voters an informed choice, that they can make a decision in a thoughtful way," said Charter Commissioner Andrew Kozak, adding that he didn't think the proposal accomplished that.
It could still come before voters next year. But the commission's action to keep it off this year's ballot dealt a major setback to activists and City Council members who have worked to transform Minneapolis' public safety system following the police killing of George Floyd.
"People in Minneapolis have been in the streets for months demanding change, only to hear from the Charter Commission that there haven't been enough studies and consultants," Sophia Benrud, an organizer with the Black Visions Collective, said in a statement. "When white supremacy is the law of the land, it is a luxury to say we need 'more time' before we can make change. Every single voter should have had the chance to vote on this amendment in 2020."
In recent weeks, the commissioners, all volunteers appointed by a judge, found themselves the focus of intense pressure from people lobbying on all sides of the fight over whether to end the Minneapolis Police Department.
At the center of that debate is the city's charter, which serves as its constitution, and requires Minneapolis to keep a Police Department with a
minimum force based on its population. A plan, written by five City Council members, would have ended that requirement and replaced the Police Department with a Department of Community Safety & Violence Prevention that would prioritize "a holistic, public health-oriented approach."
As part of a last-ditch effort to send the proposal over the hurdle, a group of City Council members sent the commissioners a letter Wednesday assuring them that they "expect the transformed system to include law enforcement as part of a multifaceted approach to public safety."
"The Minneapolis City Council is not asking you to put police abolition on the ballot, nor does the amendment propose this," they wrote. "We are asking you to let Minneapolis vote on a new framework for public safety that aligns with the State of Minnesota's Department of Public Safety."
In impassioned public hearings and a deluge of written comments in recent weeks, some urged the charter commissioners to wield their powers of review to prevent what they believe is a dangerously vague proposal from heading to voters.
Others said they urgently needed greater freedom to replace a department that disproportionately uses force on people of color, and particularly Black residents. They urged the commissioners not to block the proposal from this year's ballot.
Leading the effort to delay the proposal on Wednesday night was Charter Commissioner Jill Garcia, who questioned whether the council's proposal would actually solve the police department's underlying problems.
"This is an issue that involves the lives, the well-being, the safety of Minneapolis residents," Garcia said. "This isn't a bumper-sticker slogan, sound-bite debate. This is something that the city has begun looking at in various times throughout the past several years. The ground is fertile to continue to look at that work and to look at something that prevents the loss of lives."
On the opposite side was her colleague, Commissioner Andrea Rubenstein, who chaired a work group that studied the plan. Rubenstein said she was skeptical that another 90 days would allow them to gather any more information that would sway their opinions on the measure.
She, like many of her colleagues, shared major concerns about the council's plan. Still, she said, "I'm concerned that we need to vote this amendment up or down but I'm further concerned that if we table it, it feels more like a sleight of hand."
Commissioner Toni Newborn said she had significant concerns about the council's proposal, including how it will affect the police command structure. Still, she said, the need for change is urgent. She fears calling the police when she hears gunshots outside because she worries officers will harass or hurt her husband, who is Black.
"The time is now," she said. "We should not and cannot wait for change."
Voting in favor of the delay were commissioners Kozak, Garcia, Barry Clegg, Greg Abbott, Peter Ginder, Barbara Lickness, Jana Metge, Lyall Schwarzkopf, Dan Cohen and Matt Perry.
Voting against the delay were commissioners Rubenstein, Newborn, Al Giraud-Isaacson, Jan Sandberg, and Christopher Smith.
Council Member Cam Gordon, one of five council members who drafted the proposed amendment, said he was disappointed though not surprised with the commission's vote.
"They were predisposed to not like the idea. They seemed more comfortable with the status quo," he said. "I don't know what they're going to hope to accomplish by reviewing it longer, except to keep it off the ballot, which seemed to be the motivation of the majority of them."
If the charter commissioners had chosen to issue a recommendation on the council's proposal, the council would have been allowed to ignore it. The council and the mayor would have then needed to vote on whether to send the measure to voters this year and, if so, how it should appear on the ballot.
With the measure off the table for this year's election, there are still several scenarios that could unfold.
The council members who wrote the proposal are vowing to push for some version of it to be added to the 2021 ballot. Community groups could also launch petitions to get questions on next year's ballot.
"We've had an unprecedented outpouring of demand for change, demand for justice, unprecedented involvement from folks who are getting engaged in city government for the first time and I don't want people to feel too discouraged," City Council President Lisa Bender said. "I'm disappointed and I share the disappointment that I'm sure people are feeling, but we have more ways to move forward as we continue to build this work."
Council Member Steve Fletcher said he thinks the council will likely try to create this new public safety department on its own.
"We don't have a choice now," he said. It would be challenging, though, because they still have to fully fund the police department.
Council Member Jeremiah Ellison promised to continue pursuing other changes.
The killing of George Floyd was a "harsh reality check" that there was no path to reforming the police department, he said. He added that the commission's decision will not lessen his urgency to find alternatives to policing.
"We're going to keep pursuing that transformative change," he said. "I think that at some point, changing the charter is going to have to be a part of that."

"I look forward to working with [Police] Chief [Medaria] Arradondo, my council colleagues, and the community to transform the culture of policing in our city in the months ahead. Now it is on all of us to ... dig into this work together."
Mayor Jacob Frey
"People in Minneapolis are ready for transformative change and an end to violent policing -- now. Like white gatekeepers have done for centuries, ten Charter Commissioners did their best to slow down our movement. But we will keep moving: talking to our neighbors, building up alternative institutions to keep each other safe, and demanding city dollars for care and resources for our neighbors instead of a violent and unaccountable police force."
Oluchi Omeoga of Black Visions Collective
"Voters deserve the right to make their voice heard on the future of our public safety system. The opportunity to vote symbolizes the most democratic way to build a transformative new model of community safety, and the Charter Commission should share this invitation to ... reimagine what is possible. Our residents and constituents ... feel the urgency of this moment and we hope the Charter Commission members also acknowledge the immediate need of this national moment."
Council Member Alondra Cano
"The Commission reached the right conclusion that the potential ballot question forwarded by the City Council requires more study. I also hope their action creates a reset moment for the community."
Minneapolis Downtown Council President Steve Cramer
"The Charter Commission's choice to delay a decision today will prevent voters from achieving change and deciding the future of policing in their own city this November. The ACLU-MN will work with our partners and community members to ensure we can create a truly just system that is not based on our racist system of policing and mistreatment of People of Color."

ON THE WING: OPENING UP TO NEW FACES OF BIRDERS ; GETTING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OUTDOORS IS A MATTER OF MAKING THEM FEEL SAFE.

Full text: As a woman bird-watcher, I've occasionally found myself in places where I didn't feel comfortable when out birding alone. It might be because the spot is remote and no one's around, or it could be that too many people are sharing the space.
But I've come to realize that people of color feel this way nearly all the time when they're out in nature. A park or natural area that to me is an escape from everyday stresses can feel unsafe, even threatening, to a Black, brown or LGBTQ person.
These kinds of concerns were amplified recently by a now-famous video, showing an encounter between a white woman walking her dog in New York's Central Park and a Black bird-watcher. She called the police to falsely claim that an African American man was threatening her, essentially "weaponizing" his skin color. In a horrific coincidence, this occurred on the very same day in May that George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis.
These events have led to intense discussions in the birding community, focusing on how to make the outdoors more welcoming and safer for other-than-white people.
Because, let's face it, bird-watching has been a predominantly white activity, and organizations dedicated to birds and nature are also overwhelmingly white. Nature and outdoors organizations have bemoaned the lack of diversity in their membership for a very long time, but not much has happened to move the needle on this issue.
'No go' places
But maybe the moment has arrived to start really working for change, so people of color see other people who look like them doing what they like to do.
Black and other communities are now speaking up about their reality of being outdoors. The issues emerged pointedly in a recent series of podcasts featuring some of the young scientists and bird-watchers who created Black Birders Week in June in the wake of the Central Park incident and George Floyd's death.
Christian Cooper was the Black Central Park birder who encountered the toxic dog walker. During the podcast he noted, "There are so many places where we are vulnerable and perhaps feel unwelcome. There are so many swaths of this country where I won't go, as a Black, gay man."
Many on the panel agreed, noting that as graduate students in biology and other sciences, they'd had the experience of being outdoors, conducting field research, only to be challenged by police, questioning what they're doing.
As Corina Newsome, a graduate student in ornithology at Georgia Southern University, noted, "Outdoors is not a neutral place" to Blacks.
And a Black naturalist and educator told the panel that when he's outside, he makes sure his binoculars are visible so it doesn't look as if he's "up to no good."
White people simply don't have to deal with these kinds of issues when we head out the door. We need to recognize the chasm that lies between others' experiences and our own.
Equity and inclusion
Which brings us to the Urban Bird Collective, founded by St. Paul's Monica Bryand, a dedicated bird photographer and St. Paul Audubon member. For some years, she'd been posting bird photos on her Facebook page and kept hearing from people who wanted to watch birds but didn't feel comfortable outdoors.
"So I came up with the idea of training the trainers, people who would then take people of color and the LGBTQ community out birding, to help make the outdoors feel like a safe place," she says. Now in its third year, the collective has 20 active members and a steady following on its Facebook page. Using a grant provided by the Minnesota Ornithologists' Union, members have taken field trips locally and to birding hot spots like Duluth's Sax-Zim Bog and Hawk Ridge.
Bryand, who's a committee chair for St. Paul Audubon, and whose day job is co-executive director of Voices for Racial Justice, prefers to talk about equity and inclusion, as opposed to diversity. This is exactly the point made by the organizers of Black Birders Week -- it's not about helping existing organizations to diversify their membership. Instead, it's about getting people out into nature and helping them feel comfortable there.
Like nearly everything in these COVID-19 days, much of the collective's work has moved online, but the group's dedication and camaraderie haven't diminished. And it's efforts like theirs that are starting to make the outdoors a safe place for us all.
As Urban Bird Collective member Loreen Ann Lee put it, "Like the Baltimore oriole who carefully weaves the fine fibers of its nest to cradle the young, let us intentionally weave new spaces where we hold each other with care, empathy and understanding."

Activists slam Cup Foods' opening: Convenience store says it's time to stop blaming it in the death of George Floyd.

Full text: Cup Foods, the south Minneapolis convenience store whose 911 call led to the fatal encounter between George Floyd and Minneapolis police, reopened Monday, instantly challenging those who want the corner to remain a memorial to victims of police violence.
Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the store at the intersection of 38th and Chicago on Monday afternoon demanding it remain closed. The standoff was tense, with what sounded like gunfire nearby as opponents confronted people who showed up in defense of the store.
Jamar Nelson, a spokesman for the family that owns Cup Foods, said "it was absolutely time to open up" and that the store would stay open regardless of protests.
"We're not trying to hurt anyone, but if not now, when?" he asked. "How long [will] the store continue to be blamed for the death of George Floyd?"
On the night of May 25, a Cup Foods employee called the police to report that a man had used a counterfeit $20 bill at the store, according to charging documents and the
911 call transcript. Floyd was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by officers in front of the store less than 30 minutes later.
The store shut down as 38th and Chicago was barricaded and turned into a makeshift memorial and vigil site for Floyd. Cup Foods tried to reopen three weeks later but closed after a few days.
On Monday, neighbors said the owners attempted reopening a few times since then. Nelson disputed that claim, but admitted that "there should've been a longer mourning period before we opened up the first time."
A security guard stood by the entrance of the store Monday morning, a small neon sign on the window declaring it "OPEN." Employees stood behind the counters, the shelves fully stocked with drinks and snacks.
Co-owner Mahmoud Abumayyaleh, wearing a T-shirt depicting a colorful memorial in tribute to Floyd on the store's southern wall, was opening a pack of disposable face masks. He declined to be interviewed.
For many at the intersection, it was as if a wound had been reopened. They described the store, which has been there for more than 30 years, as holding back the South Side and being a magnet for illicit activity on the corner.
After hearing the store was reopening, Carmen Means, executive director of the Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization (CANDO), was at the intersection early Monday morning denouncing the decision.
"They have a laundry list of just being harmful to this community," Means said. "It's time that we hold them accountable, and accountability looks like closing that door. Not furthering harm looks like closing that door."
Nelson said the store reopened because it served a need in the community, offering affordable food and other items. There are other grocery stores in the surrounding area, including the Seward Community Co-op just blocks away on 38th Street.
He added that the store has worked with neighbors since Floyd was killed, including by participating in food drives. Employees will undergo anti-bias training in coming weeks, he said, and the store would commission a mural and community garden.
But neighbors deserve better, Means said.
"We have to use the brilliance of this moment to create a solution," she said. "Seward Co-op is not the answer, and Cup Foods is not the answer."
Marcia Howard, a high-school teacher who lives just steps from 38th and Chicago, said Cup Foods caters to people in a pinch and a "desperate" regular clientele. Ultimately, she said, the market would decide whether the store survives at the intersection.
"Whoever shows up, whether to walk through those doors or to stand in front of them, are the ones who determine the fate of this as a commercial venture," she said.
On Monday afternoon, protesters held their fists in the air chanting, "Keep Cup Closed!" as Cup Foods employees and clientele looked out the store window.
Some in the crowd rolled trash bins in front of the store to create a blockade. Several young people then walked over and attempted to move the bins, leading to loud arguments.
What sounded like shots rang out from somewhere close by. A few minutes later, it happened again.
Hennepin County Commissioner Angela Conley spoke with Abumayyaleh outside the store, explaining to him that neighbors have yet to see justice in the killing of Floyd.
"It's something that really needs to be vetted by community," she said. "It's not a decision that can be taken lightly, especially when people are still grieving."
Meanwhile, the Minneapolis Planning Commission met virtually to name Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th streets as "George Perry Floyd Jr Place." If the City Council approves the name, the city would add a commemorative plaque on the intersection where he was killed.
"I think this is one step in a future of really trying to make amends for some of the challenges that our community has faced in the past," City Council Member Andrea Jenkins, who represents part of the community, said at the meeting.
The City Council will take a final vote on the commemorative name change in September.

Bodycam videos published: Daily Mail claims George Floyd footage was leaked to the media company.

Author: Xiong, Chao

Full text: A British media company on Monday published segments of two leaked body-worn camera videos showing the arrest and death of George Floyd in May at the hands of Minneapolis police.
The Daily Mail published an article with the videos on its website at 10:53 a.m. Central time. It showed about 10 minutes of video from former officer Thomas Lane's bodycam and about 18 minutes from former officer J. Alexander Kueng's bodycam.
The two former officers' bodycam videos were made available for public viewing inside the Hennepin County courthouse in mid-July, but were prohibited from being recorded or publicly distributed.
It's unclear how the Daily Mail got the videos. The article said they were "leaked" to the company.
Hennepin County District Court spokesman Spenser Bickett confirmed that the court was aware of the leak, and said an investigation was underway. "The court will provide no further comment on this matter at this time," Bickett said in an e-mail.
Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is leading the prosecution of the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's death, issued a statement that he was not the source of the leak.
"We will continue to take the strictest precautions to ensure a fair trial," Ellison said.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill is presiding over the former officers' cases. Cahill had prohibited the videos from being distributed outside of the courthouse. He also prohibited the media and public from recording them when they were made available.
The videos published by the Daily Mail appeared to have been recorded on a device while they were played on a laptop in a courthouse conference room.
The courts had provided a large room and several laptops to view the videos, and required attendees to stow away their own personal laptops and cellphones during the hourlong viewing sessions. Sheriff's deputies and court staff were stationed throughout the room as several members of the media and public viewed the videos.
The two videos, which totaled about 65 minutes, were viewable by the media and public by appointment only. Sixty-six slots were made available.
Attorney Earl Gray had filed the videos in court in early July as evidence supporting his motion to dismiss the charges against Lane, his client. Court filings make evidence, including bodycam footage, public data, according to state law.
A coalition of local and national media companies, including the Star Tribune, filed a motion in July seeking immediate release of the videos. Cahill took the issue under advisement and has not issued a decision on the matter.
The videos, which were viewed by Star Tribune reporters in July, showed that Floyd was given no explanation for why he was being questioned before Lane pointed a gun and swore at him, touched him multiple times and forced him out of his vehicle into the street.
Kueng and Lane had responded to Cup Foods on May 25 on a report that Floyd had allegedly used a counterfeit $20 bill. They arrested Floyd. Their former colleagues, Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao, arrived later to help them.
Kueng, Lane and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. Prosecutors have said Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly 8 minutes, but Kueng's video showed that it was about 9 minutes and 30 seconds.
The bodycam videos and a video recorded by a bystander showed that Floyd repeatedly told the officers he couldn't breathe, and that several bystanders pleaded with them to stop, but were ignored.
Cahill set the matter for trial next March.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION REPORT: PLENTY OF WORK AHEAD ; DIVERSITY IN TOP RANKS HAS GROWN JUST INCREMENTALLY ; ONLY FOUR WOMEN ARE A PART OF MINNESOTA'S TOP-PAID EXECUTIVES

Full text: Pledges for increased diversity in public companies have intensified since George Floyd's death on Memorial Day. Chief executives have not only given to community efforts but also said they are listening and know they need to do better in integrating staffs.
Minnesota's largest public companies have a long way to go when it comes to their leadership. Two of the 50 top-paid executives on this year's Star Tribune list are people of color. Omar Ishrak of Medtronic retired in the spring, which leaves only Gary Maharaj of Eden Prairie-based Surmodics among active chief executives.
Four of the top-paid chief executives are women: Corie Barry of Best Buy, Beth Wozniak of nVent, Shelly Ibach of Sleep Number and Vicki Holt of Protolabs.
Diversity in C-suites and boards of directors is increasing but is nowhere near mirroring the population as a whole.
In Minnesota, the inclusion of people of color is moving even more slowly than representation of women, according to Rebecca Hawthorne, professor emeritus of organizational leadership at St. Catherine University.
"Generally speaking, trends have been improving incrementally throughout the last 12 years of the research; it has been very slow," said Hawthorne, an author of the Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership.
On boards, representation is more
visible. Nearly all of Minnesota's public companies have at least one woman on their board of directors.
Minnesota's largest public company, UnitedHealth Group -- whose chief executive, David Wichmann, was the highest-paid executive last year with $52.1 million in compensation -- lists four women, one of color, on its 17-person leadership team and three women, two of color, on its 10-member board of directors.
While some of the companies' leadership is more diverse, UnitedHealth's numbers are representative.
Plenty of evidence shows that companies that have more diverse voices on boards and in management do better financially. It's the reason some large institutional investors have pushed diversity initiatives, including State Street, the world's third-largest asset manager and a significant investor in nearly all of Minnesota's largest public companies.
The calls for diversity often become louder after events such as George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police and the protests that have followed. Many companies across the country say his death -- and those of other Black people by police -- have spurred a more honest and robust conversation, from people of color speaking candidly about their experiences to internal petitions for more diversity.
The call for equal representation for women also has been yearslong, pushed by several national initiatives and groups like Catalyst.
St. Catherine has been studying the inclusion of women on the boards and in management of Minnesota public companies for 12 years. Its most recent report, the 2019 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership, showed women held 22.9% of the available board positions at 76 Minnesota public companies, up from 14.2% in the first year of the study. The year also saw the largest net increase of female board members.
The study also showed women holding 22.7% of available executive-officer positions, the highest percentage in the 12 years, up from 15.5% in the first year of its census.
"There has been increased focus internationally, nationally and locally on issues of diversity, and gender diversity as one element of that in terms of corporate leadership, starting at the board level," Hawthorne said. "That increased scrutiny has definitely made a difference."
That pressure includes a mix of reporting requirements from governments and pressure from both investors and peer companies.
"When we have different bodies actually putting forth accountability, that does change the picture a bit," Hawthorne said. "We really didn't see that in 2008 when we started the research."
Washington state this year passed legislation requiring the public companies there to have 25% of their board members be women by Jan. 1, 2022.
California has a similar mandate, and Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have been advancing such rules. The European Union has had rules on board diversity for years.
The Fearless Girl campaign by institutional shareholder State Street is more than a statue. The investment group identified 1,384 companies across the world without any women on their boards and pressed them to include more female candidates and directors. Since the launch of the campaign, the company said 681 companies have added directors who are women, including 495 in the United States.
Shareholder proposals on company proxies also have asked fellow shareholders to support more diversity on their boards and in CEO searches.
New York City Retirement Systems submitted a shareholder proposal this year at Berkshire Hathaway asking the company to adopt a "policy for improving board and top management diversity."
It's part of a larger effort announced earlier this year by New York City Retirement Systems to get companies to consider women and people of color for board positions and in CEO searches.

Full text: On Tuesday, Crystal Gail Welcome completed her 310-mile thru-hike at the northern end of the Superior Hiking Trail. But she said her trek truly finished when she visited the memorial site for George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.
Welcome, a writer and activist from Atlanta, set out July 4 to honor Floyd's life and bring attention to racial injustice through different means. She said it was at the end of the hike when the idea struck to drive hundreds of miles south. The night was beautiful pinks and blues. She signed the logbook and took a photo, and her partner, Demi Kapler, handed Welcome her diploma from Prescott College in Arizona.
"You did all these miles, and that's your finish," she said of her thoughts. "That's where you need to go."
Welcome, 39, recounted many encounters along the trail -- almost too many at times, she said -- with people who wanted to meet and talk, or tell her about their activism. "I had a lot of positive interactions," she said. She especially relished a final night at the on-trail Hazel campsite where she encountered a group of high school girls and a separate high school boy out hiking, too. The conversations were light, hitting on gear and gap years. But they were serious, too, digging into issues about racism and barriers for people of color like Welcome, who is Black.
On Thursday, Welcome met a friend she'd made on her thru-hike, and they headed to the site of Floyd's death at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue. Welcome had learned, too, of the death of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a champion of civil rights.
Welcome started crying as she walked to the intersection and carried that grief to the Cup Foods storefront. "It was just so much," she said.
Later, Welcome left her hiking hat, trekking poles and jottings about her mission and message at the memorial. A thought echoed in her, she said: "This is where this hike ends, but not where the fight ends."
