More than five years ago, Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, signed an executive order to address a persistent concern: Police officers were rarely held accountable for killing unarmed people. Often, those who died were Black.
The solution was to take the cases out of the hands of local prosecutors, whose close relationships with the police led to accusations of bias, and hand them over to the office of the state attorney general.
But the change in the legal process has not altered the results. Of the 43 investigations that the attorney general’s office has conducted in the years since, none has yet led to a conviction. Three officers have been charged — two with murder and another with assault, the office said. About one-quarter of the investigations are still open.
On Tuesday, there was another familiar outcome. A grand jury convened by the attorney general’s office declined to indict any of the seven officers involved in the incident that led to the death of Daniel Prude in Rochester last year. Prude, who was Black, died after the police arrested him in the throes of an apparent psychotic episode, placed a hood over his head and pressed him into the street until he became unconscious.
The case shows that even as the demand that the police face more serious consequences has intensified, the legal system remains tilted in favor of law enforcement, said current and former prosecutors who have sought charges against officers.
New York’s system of investigating deaths caused by police officers is among the most far-reaching in the nation. But officers are afforded special legal protections when they use force in the course of their job. And juries are historically deferential to the police and receptive to arguments defending their actions. Officers often must make split-second decisions in dangerous circumstances, a reality that is not lost on jurors.
“The system was built to protect and shield officers from wrongdoing and accountability,” Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said when she announced the results of the investigation into Prude’s death. James added that she was “disappointed — extremely disappointed” in the grand jury’s decision.
Cuomo signed the executive order in 2015, a year after the killing of Eric Garner, a Staten Island man who died in a police chokehold. Gwen Carr, Garner’s mother, was present as the governor said he hoped the order would restore some faith in the legal system.
“I’m not aware of any state unit on the same level as the one in New York,” said Philip M. Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio and a former police officer. The special unit assigned to the investigations in New York is made up of “top-notch prosecutors, they know what they’re doing, they have a lot of experience. And they still can’t get grand juries to return indictments, let alone obtain convictions.”
The office has been limited in its mission by the order’s narrow design: Until a new law goes into effect in April, prosecutors can only pursue cases that result in a death. The victim also has to have been unarmed.
In one case, prosecutors determined they were unable to move forward with an investigation when a man was shot by police after he struck and seriously injured an officer with a chair. The chair, prosecutors decided, qualified as a weapon.
The attorney general’s office said that of the 43 cases it has taken on under the 2015 order, grand juries declined to return indictments against officers in three of the deaths, including Prude’s. Of 12 open cases, two involve officers that have been indicted. The other 10 remain under investigation, the office said.
A spokesperson for the attorney general, as well as supporters of New York’s program, said the lack of charges and convictions belied the unit’s other achievement: enhancing public trust by extracting these cases from the hands of local prosecutors who might be loath to prosecute the police — in essence, their partners in law enforcement.
“The numbers alone do not account for the independence and transparency that is so critical and that we provide,” said Delaney Kempner, a spokesperson for James.
But to some members of the public — and those who have lost loved ones at the hands of the police — improved transparency provides little comfort.
“The justice system doesn’t give a damn about us,” Joe Prude, Prude’s brother, told The New York Times a day after the grand jury declined to charge anyone involved in his brother’s death. “That’s not built for anyone in the community; that’s built for the police to keep slaughtering people.”
The attorney general’s program, called the Special Investigations and Prosecutions Unit, has noted that Black and Latino people are disproportionately the victims of deadly police force. A 2019 biennial report from the unit pointed out a “disturbing trend” in the period covered by the report. Of the 13 civilians killed in police custody or in shootings involving police, seven were Black and four were Latino.
In her news conference about Prude’s case, James seemed to blame the outcome in the case on limitations inherent in the law. Police officers in New York have the legal right to use deadly force in numerous circumstances, such as when they feel their own lives are in danger. In cases that do not involve shootings, investigators are often unable to show conclusively that officers’ actions directly caused the deaths of people in their custody.
In one case in 2018, the unit did not seek charges after a Bronx man was restrained by seven officers and died. In another, in 2020, after a woman in Rockland County died after being restrained and shot with a Taser by police officers, the unit found it could not establish that the officers had committed a crime.
Even for prosecutors who are dedicated to investigating cases against police officers, doing so is not easy. Christy E. Lopez, a former Department of Justice lawyer who helped lead the investigation into the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, said that public opinion remains on the side of the police.
“Despite all the protests this summer, the fact is that most Americans are incredibly protective of police, especially in these criminal cases,” said Lopez, who is now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. “And so that’s the thing to look at, is are we willing to hold police criminally accountable?”
Jim Burch, president of the National Police Foundation, an organization that seeks to help police do their jobs more effectively, said that he had heard from officers who had issues with police accountability initiatives.
“There are some who believe that some of these measures may not be necessary, maybe they’re an overreach, maybe they’re not going to solve the actual problems that some feel exist," he said. "They feel that the problems are more associated with things like training, or compensation."
But he added that his organization believed in accountability measures, including prosecutorial independence, and he felt that ultimately they helped the reputation and legitimacy of police officers.
In an email, a spokesperson for the governor, Peter Ajemian, said Cuomo was committed to accountability in the justice system beyond the executive order.
“The governor believes the best way to repair the rupture in police-community relations is for localities to re-imagine policing in a way that suits their unique needs,” Ajemian said.
Last summer, after years of political wrangling, lawmakers in Albany enshrined the executive order into law and expanded its scope to include cases of people who were armed.
“That clarity is really helpful because in these investigations, every second counts,” said Alvin Bragg, a lawyer who led the state unit under the former attorney general, Eric Schneiderman.
The office said that the broadening of the law, which goes into effect in April, is likely to triple its caseload.
Bragg, a Democrat who is a candidate for Manhattan district attorney, said that without additional reforms, racial biases that lead juries to see Black victims as less sympathetic would continue to keep police free from legal consequences.
“We need some law reform, and we need the police not to kill people in the first instance,” Bragg said.
Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, a Democrat who represents southeast Brooklyn and was one of the main backers of the law, stressed that it was only a first step. Perry said establishing a legal definition of what qualifies as excessive force is central so that jurors can determine if the police have broken the law.
But absent such a definition, “there is no limit on the police officer’s perception and judgment in the situation,” Perry said, “which is what leads to a lot of acquittals when there are strong cases that what was done was criminal.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — In late 2018, Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr. (pronounced “sai-eed”) heard something he couldn’t get out of his head.
He was at his job at Gimlet, a podcast production company, working on a show called “Conviction,” about a dogged private investigator in the Bronx. As one of the show’s producers, Tejan-Thomas edited tape and assisted with scripts, painstaking work that required sifting through dozens of hours of interviews each week. One interview jumped out at him: an encounter outside a bodega with a group of Black and Latino men in their late teens and early 20s. The story the young men told was disturbing — a notorious cop had been terrorizing their neighborhood for years — but they were clamoring to tell it, talking over one another in a vibrant hash of emphatic vernacular.
Tejan-Thomas, who is 28, knew that sound well. He’d hear it in the lobby of his apartment building in Flatbush, or at the train station on his way to work in Downtown Brooklyn. But he’d never heard it while at work. As a young audio journalist, he’d studied shows like “This American Life,” “Radiolab” and “TED Radio Hour,” series that he loved but featured few Black voices. Gimlet, too, the home of popular series like “StartUp” and “Reply All” (Spotify acquired the company in 2019), had mostly white hosts, including on “Conviction.” Listening to the teens at the bodega, it was as if previously distinct worlds — personal and professional, Black and predominantly white — had somehow collided.
“I realized, ‘Oh, that sounds really good; I think I want more of that,’” Tejan-Thomas told me recently, in a video call from Flatbush. “It was something that I held onto and always wanted to go back to, to give those kinds of people a platform.”
With “Resistance,” a new Gimlet podcast that Tejan-Thomas cocreated and hosts, he finally has that platform. The show, about “refusing to accept things as they are,” as its tag line says, tells evocative, deeply reported stories about people who, by virtue of identity, find headline social and political conflicts at their doorstep.
Begun last fall in the aftermath of the global Black Lives Matter protests, “Resistance” is dominated by a medley of young, Black voices. One early episode pays a visit to the only Black man in a small, extremely white town in Nebraska; a three-part series embeds with a collective of racial justice activists whose members tangle with the police and each other; an exploration of Nigeria’s #EndSARS campaign spotlights queer agitators at its margins. Throughout, Tejan-Thomas and his producers — Wallace Mack, Bethel Habte and Aaron Randle — unearth extraordinary stories from communities of color that other narrative nonfiction podcasts are less equipped to detect.
“In radio at large, there’s a bias toward surprise,” said Habte, who teamed up with Tejan-Thomas last year after three years at “Radiolab.” “But whether or not you feel someone’s story is surprising depends on your perspective.”
Tejan-Thomas , who has refulgent brown skin and a resonant baritone, came to radio from poetry. While attending Virginia Commonwealth University, he fell in with a spoken word crew on campus and competed nationally as a slam poet. The community helped shape his political views — “I was challenged to think critically about racism and misogyny in a way that I hadn’t been taught in school” — and encouraged him to write from personal experience.
After graduating in 2015, he was uncertain about his future when he discovered “This American Life.” That groundbreaking radio series and podcast’s blend of storytelling and performance felt related to spoken word.
“It was journalism that was starting from a personal place and exploring internal and emotional conflicts,” said Tejan-Thomas. “I was like, ‘That’s the work I’ve been doing in poetry. Let me just try and learn to do that.’”
At the time, podcasting was just beginning to take off as a medium — in 2014, “Serial” and Gimlet had helped ignite a renaissance — and Tejan-Thomas found himself on the ground floor.
A residency with Transom, a kind of incubator for audio journalists, led to an internship at NPR’s Story Lab (an in-house creative studio) where he produced an episode of “Code Switch,” an influential podcast about race. He honed his narrative nonfiction skills at Gimlet, where he started as an intern on the Civil War history podcast “Uncivil” (Tejan-Thomas was a producer when the show won a Peabody Award in 2017) before jumping to the popular hip-hop series “Mogul” and later “Conviction.”
A precursor to “Resistance” can be heard in Tejan-Thomas’ stand-alone audio essay from 2019, “Borders Between Us.” It tells the story of his immigration to the United States from Sierra Leone as an 8-year-old and explores his fraught relationship with his mother, who died of cancer when Tejan-Thomas was a teenager. The essay, which won the silver prize for documentary at the Third Coast International Audio Festival in 2020, was an attempt to synthesize everything he knew about poetry, reporting and sound design.
“It was the first time I got to do a feature-length piece on my own,” said Tejan-Thomas. “It gave me the opportunity to experiment with making something uniquely myself that wasn’t in anyone else’s voice or style.”
In podcasting, a voice is never just a voice. It’s both medium and message, inevitably coded with information not only about the words being uttered — is this a poignant reflection, or a lighthearted anecdote? — but the identity of the speaker. In serious narrative audio, the most common voices have long been white and upper middle class (a Quartz report found that just 18% of U.S. podcasts overall had a nonwhite host), sending an implicit but persistent message about what is normal, and what isn’t.
“In my first few radio pieces, a big thing that I had to work through was just how my voice sounded,” said Tejan-Thomas. “I felt like I needed to make sure that I was being very straight with my reads in order to sound like an impartial, objective journalist.”
Chenjerai Kumanyika, co-host of “Uncivil” and author of a viral essay from 2015 called “The Whiteness of ‘Public Radio Voice,’” said that, for Black people at white radio institutions, “Certain things start to get structured in your brain about how to speak.”
“It can push you in a Sarah Koenig or [Alex] Blumberg direction,” he said, referring to the white hosts of “Serial” and “StartUp.”
On “Resistance,” Tejan-Thomas makes an effort to approximate his natural speaking style. The show is flecked with African-American colloquialisms, as in the introduction to an episode featuring the “Borders Between Us” essay, which Tejan-Thomas disclaims as “low key all of my personal dirt.”
“I’ll write something a million times until I’ve found the rhythm or the words that feel like me,” he said. “I want the Black and brown people listening to feel like, ‘Yeah, that’s somebody I know,’ or, ‘That’s somebody I grew up with.’ I want them to know that this is for them, so that they’ll be open to what we’re saying and have access to these stories.”
As with many of the better-reported podcasts, the experience of listening to “Resistance” can be likened to eavesdropping. Its stories grant unusually intimate access to the subjective experiences of strangers. What sets the show apart are small but indelible details, as in a recent episode about a woman in Baltimore named Kelly.
Kelly’s story begins as a romance — Keith, a childhood friend, comes back into her life after a long absence — but takes a turn when Keith is shot by police and arrested after a reported robbery. The ensuing criminal case follows a long and tragic arc that we feel like we’ve seen before. But the producer and reporter Wallace Mack gets behind and underneath it, finding moments of humor (Kelly on the trope of women who “ride or die” for their incarcerated partners: “Where we riding to? And why we gotta die?”), as well as profundity and, yes, surprise.
“There are a lot of shows that give the narrative treatment to certain other kinds of communities,” said Habte. “But we have the ability to extend that empathy to people who are often maligned, or who only get attention through protests.
“What was going on in their lives before they decided they had to fight for what they believed in?” she continued. “If you take the fight for granted, what else is there? As it turns out, a lot.”
For Tejan-Thomas, stories of resistance have more than entertainment value. The prologue of the first episode of the series charts his own journey from protest-marching, poetry-writing college activism to the resigned fatalism that defined his initial reaction to the death of George Floyd last spring.
That resignation, Tejan-Thomas told me, stemmed partly from personal tragedy — in college, he lost a close friend to police violence — as well as a more general sense that demonstrations in response to the police killings of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and others had achieved little beyond catharsis for participants.
“Resistance,” he said, is a check against the inclination toward that kind of cynicism.
“Black folks have every reason to feel hopeless, bogged down and cynical — all things that I feel like I’m constantly dealing with,” he said. “The show is an exercise in counting all the reasons people find not to feel that way, to face the impossible and say, ‘I’m going to do something.’”

A new federal grand jury has been empaneled in Minneapolis and the Justice Department has called new witnesses as part of its investigation of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who will go on trial in state court next month on a murder charge for the death of George Floyd, according to two people with direct knowledge of the investigation.
The fresh slate of witnesses subpoenaed to give testimony about Chauvin is an early sign that the federal investigation into the death of Floyd, which began last year and then languished, is being reinvigorated under the administration of President Joe Biden.
Chauvin, who is white, was seen in harrowing video footage kneeling for more than nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a Black man, as he begged for his life. The video set off protests across the United States, some of which led to violence in cities including Minneapolis; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Washington, D.C.
It is unlikely that the Justice Department, in presenting evidence to a new grand jury, is hoping for a quick indictment of Chauvin before his state trial, which is scheduled to begin March 8. But if there was an acquittal or a mistrial, attention would immediately shift to the federal investigation and to whether Chauvin would face trial for violating Floyd’s civil rights.
As a new grand jury begins to hear more testimony in the case, the investigation has apparently narrowed to focus on Chauvin, rather than the three other former officers who face aiding and abetting charges, according to one of the people briefed on the matter, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation.
As Chauvin’s trial looms, Minneapolis is consumed with fears that the proceedings could provoke more unrest. The National Guard has been activated to protect the city’s downtown during the trial, and law enforcement agencies from around the state are being called upon to help secure the Twin Cities. Chauvin, who is free on bail and has been allowed to live outside Minnesota because of security concerns, is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
The Justice Department’s investigation into Chauvin is also shaping up as an early test for Biden, who has vowed to allow the department to operate independently of the White House.
Biden has said that Floyd’s death was an injustice born from America’s long history of racism. “The very soul of America is at stake,” he said in a speech soon after Floyd died. “We must commit as a nation to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.”
During the presidential campaign, Biden vowed to give new powers to the Justice Department’s civil rights division and elevate civil rights as a priority within the White House, a statement that at the time raised doubts about how independent it would be.
Biden has not been involved in or briefed on the Justice Department’s investigation into the death of Floyd, according to a White House official. But the White House has staff members working on civil rights issues in both the White House Counsel’s Office, as well as through the Domestic Policy Council.
The White House, in a statement, said, “the president has spoken in personal terms about how the death of George Floyd affected him and redoubled his commitment to advancing racial justice, but he’s also made clear that he firmly believes that the Department of Justice must be able to act independently in investigating and prosecuting any case.”
Three days after Floyd died, Erica MacDonald, the outgoing U.S. attorney in Minnesota, said that her office and the Justice Department’s civil rights division would investigate whether the officers violated federal law, calling the case a “top priority.”
But the attorney general at the time, William Barr, said at a news conference that “as a matter of comity,” the department “typically lets the state go forward with its proceedings first,” a statement that put to rest the possibility that a charging decision would come before the election.
Nevertheless, Barr made clear that the video was harrowing. “When you watch it, and imagine that one of your own loved ones was being treated like that, and begging for their lives, it is impossible for any normal human being not to be struck in the heart with horror,” he said.
As The New York Times recently reported, three days after Floyd died May 25, Chauvin was ready to plead guilty to third-degree murder and go to prison for more than a decade. But the offer fell apart after Barr, at the last minute, rejected the deal, which had been contingent on the Justice Department agreeing not to bring additional federal charges in the future. Over the summer, a federal grand jury in Minneapolis, which has since expired, began hearing evidence and testimony about Floyd’s death.
The department has previously opened up investigations into several high-profile assaults and killings of Black people by police officers — including the killings of Eric Garner on Staten Island, New York; Tamir Rice in Cleveland; Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri — but it has rarely charged officers in those cases.
Former Justice Department officials said that is in part because the department has only one charge it can bring in these cases — that in the course of policing, an officer willfully deprived a person of their civil rights — and that the charge is difficult to prove. (The charge does not involve race but is based on the idea that an officer “willfully” violated someone’s constitutional rights, such as protection against unreasonable seizure, or the right to due process.)
While it is easier to show that an officer’s use of force deprived a person of their civil rights, whether it was “willful” or not has been a challenge, said Jonathan M. Smith, a former official in the Justice Department’s civil rights division who now serves as executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.
“Willfulness is the highest intent standard under criminal law — that the person set out to act with the purpose of depriving someone of their rights,” Smith said. “You need to prove that the law enforcement officer actually knew that he was going to violate someone’s rights and acted with that purpose in mind. It’s akin to proving first-degree murder.”
The Justice Department said last year that it was reviewing other high-profile police shootings that fueled months of protests over police brutality. After a 29-year-old Black man named Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a white officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August, the department said that it had opened a civil rights investigation into the incident. It confirmed that the investigation was ongoing in January, after the Kenosha County district attorney declined to charge the officer who shot Blake.
Similarly, the FBI said in May that it was investigating the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor, a Black health care worker in Louisville, Kentucky, after Gov. Andy Beshear asked local and federal investigators to look into the case. The results of the FBI investigation have not been released, and the department has not said that it will open a civil rights investigation into the officers involved in Taylor’s killing.
The statute was used successfully in hundreds of cases under the Obama administration, for instance, to convict officers of abusing their authority to sexually assault victims or to beat inmates, Smith said. But in the most high-profile police assault and killing cases, it has been seldom used.
This is one reason some former Justice Department officials and politicians like Vice President Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor herself, have advocated for either changing the statute so that willfulness is no longer the standard, or passing a new federal law that makes it illegal for an officer to recklessly deprive a person of their civil rights, rather than willfully deprive them.
Judge Merrick Garland, Biden’s nominee to run the Justice Department, said Monday during his Senate confirmation hearing that he would consult with the career lawyers in the civil rights division about whether to lower the willfulness standard.
“I’d like them to know from talking to them what kinds of changes might be necessary in the statute” and the potential consequences of changing the requirement, Garland said.
That is not to say that the statute has never been successfully used in police brutality cases. When Barr was attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, he oversaw the investigation that led to the convictions of two officers who viciously beat motorist Rodney King, even after they were acquitted on separate state charges.

A Donor’s Ties to Epstein Are Criticized at MoMA and Dartmouth

The artist Ai Weiwei said he would ask the Museum of Modern Art to remove his works from its collection if the museum refuses to part ways with its chairman, investor Leon Black, given recent revelations about the Wall Street executive’s close professional association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Photographer Nan Goldin joined more than 150 artists who have also called for Black’s removal from MoMA’s board. And at Black’s alma mater, Dartmouth, there are growing calls for his name to be removed from the college’s visual arts center.
The pressure is building at a time when institutions are being held to account for everything from the diversity of their staffs to the professional ties and actions of their trustees. But it’s also coming at a moment when colleges, museums and nonprofit institutions are starved for revenue and donations because of the economic fallout from the pandemic, leaving many reluctant to distance themselves from loyal and wealthy benefactors.
Black announced last month that he would step down this year as CEO of Apollo Global Management, the giant private equity firm he co-founded, amid revelations that he had paid $158 million to Epstein from 2012-17 after Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl. But Black will remain Apollo’s chairman.
An outside review for Apollo’s board, conducted by the law firm Dechert, found that Black had paid Epstein, a financier, the $158 million for tax and estate advisory services over a five-year period. Black also lent $30 million to Epstein, only $10 million of which was paid back. But Dechert said it found no wrongdoing on Black’s part.
In all, Black accounted for 85% of the fees raked in by Epstein at his Southern Trust Company after his 2008 conviction through his arrest in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges involving other underage girls. Epstein killed himself a month later while in federal custody.
Now Black’s philanthropy is coming under scrutiny, including from major figures in the art world.
“I would feel ashamed to be associated with the MoMA if it takes a firm position in keeping someone who has been confirmed to have hurt basic values or has worked against truth and fairness,” Ai, a Chinese artist and dissident, said in an email interview. “If so, I hope they won’t include any of my works in their collection.”
At Dartmouth, where Black served as a trustee for nearly a decade, several students and alumni, in the student newspaper, have called for Black’s name to be removed from the Black Family Visual Arts Center. (The building houses Dartmouth’s departments of studio art, film and media studies and digital humanities.) Black donated $48 million to the center.
“This isn’t a close call,” wrote Michael Harrison, a member of Dartmouth's class of 2024, adding that the center “should absolutely be renamed.”
An editorial in The Dartmouth, urged the college to stop “selling the names of its buildings to the highest bidder.”
“Yes, ending the practice of naming buildings for donors would remove a fund-raising tool,” the editorial said. “But we should hope that donors give to the College for something greater than narcissism.”
Ruth Cserr, a 1988 Dartmouth graduate and a founding member of a college group that has lobbied against gender harassment and sexual violence, is among those who have signed an op-ed and submitted it to the local paper to put pressure on Dartmouth’s administration and trustees.
“In my ideal world, Black comes and says, ‘Let’s take the name down and name it for something better,’ ” Cserr said in an interview, adding that, to her, keeping his name on the center “does feel offensive.”
Whether such objections to Black will have any effect remains to be seen.
Philanthropy experts said the decision to revoke naming rights or ask big donors to step down from board positions is not an easy one when a situation involves guilt by association with a notorious individual, rather than proven wrongdoing by the donor. Any judgment comes down to whether the association itself is troubling enough to scare off other donors or sully an institution’s reputation, experts said.
“It is sort of a gray area for Black,” said Bill Stanczykiewicz, assistant dean for external relations and fundraising at Indiana University’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. “When artists start saying, ‘We don’t want to put our work in your museum,’ that does send a signal.”
Glenn D. Lowry, director of MoMA, which has not indicated that it has any intention of removing Black, declined to comment.
Justin Anderson, a Dartmouth spokesman, said the school had no plans to strip Black’s name from the arts center. Black also endowed a chair for Shakespearean studies there. (Dartmouth does not plan to remove his name from that, either.)
“For his part, Leon Black has stated that he is appalled by Epstein and deeply regrets his involvement with him,” Anderson said. “To date we are aware of no allegations by anyone in law enforcement, the media or in the independent review conducted for Apollo that Leon Black engaged in any of Epstein’s shameful behavior.”
Black, through a representative, declined to comment.
Institutions that have benefited from Black’s largesse were clearly looking to Apollo for cues as to how to handle the Epstein fallout, but Apollo’s decision to keep Black on as chairman of the firm sent mixed messages. (At least one co-founder of the firm had wanted Black to step away from Apollo even sooner.)
As a result, institutions like MoMA and Dartmouth have largely remained quiet, even as voices of opposition to Black’s primacy in the nonprofit sphere have been growing louder.
In perhaps the most coordinated effort so far, more than 150 artists — including Nicole Eisenman and Michael Rakowitz — this month called for Black to be removed from the MoMA board.
“Beyond his removal, we must think seriously about a collective exit from art’s imbrication in toxic philanthropy and structures of oppression,” the artists said in their statement to the art publication Hyperallergic, “so that we don’t have to have the same conversations over and over, one board member at a time.”
In a separate statement sent to Hyperallergic, artist and filmmaker Hito Steyerl took issue with Black’s having used Epstein to help him reduce tax payments on assets, including art, adding that MoMA’s inaction on the matter “risks contaminating not only the work of artists, but the art world as a whole.
“In a time when people worldwide are suffering economically, mentally and physically,” Steyerl added, “pursuits like art assisted tax avoidance start appearing for what they are: excesses of entitlement and privilege.”
Asked for her reaction to Black’s continued service as MoMA’s chairman, artist Judy Chicago, whose work is in the museum’s collection, said in an interview that Black exemplifies “the tawdry values of the art world.”
“Getting rid of one man may feel like a victory to some,” she added. “For me, it’s the whole system that has to change.”
And Donald Sultan, an artist known for his large flower paintings, said, “As chairman he’s a very poor person to represent the museum at that level and they probably should ask him to step down.”
Black, in the wake of revelations about how much he paid Epstein, has pledged to give more than $200 million in grants to organizations that support women’s rights and oppose human trafficking.
Despite the growing chorus of protest from artists, it may not be easy for MoMA to part ways with Black, given his past generosity to the museum (he donated $40 million in 2018) and the potential of future gifts and loans from his extensive art collection.
Black lent the museum Edvard Munch’s 1895 version of “The Scream” in 2012, for which he had paid nearly $120 million, the highest price at auction at the time. He also paid $106 million for “Bust of a Woman,” which was featured in the museum’s acclaimed 2016 Picasso sculpture show.
His personal collection is estimated to be valued at $1 billion and much of it is held by two corporate entities: Narrows Holdings and AP Narrows. The National Gallery of Art in Washington listed Narrows Holdings in 2018 as an entity that lent an exhibition to the museum.
The outside report compiled by Dechert for Apollo said that Epstein had worked with Black’s family office on providing advice on art loans and how to handle a dispute between Black and another big collector over the Picasso bust.
The report also said that Epstein was instrumental in “obtaining a potential advisory opinion from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance regarding a contemplated transaction involving Black’s art.”
Lawyers from Dechert did not provide any details on that advisory opinion but two of Black’s companies are currently involved in a sales-tax dispute with New York tax officials over the sale of two Cézanne watercolor paintings. The dispute with New York also involves a separate sale of a Picasso painting with another wealthy money manager.
In March, an administrative law judge ordered a hearing on a claim by the New York tax division that the company that was used to buy and sell the three paintings did not collect sufficient New York State sales tax and was short some $3.6 million.
The dispute is still pending.

Black Grief, White Grievance: Artists Search for Racial Justice

In the matter of racial justice, the United States has built up terrible karma over the centuries. And in the past four divisive years, the festering badness, in the form of white nationalism, has been there for all the world to see. Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor saw it, and the impassioned exhibition “Grief and Grievance: Art and Mourning in America” at the New Museum was his direct and personal response, one that he conceived as a moral broadside and intended to deliver just before the 2020 presidential election.
Fate intervened. Enwezor succumbed to cancer in 2019, at 55, a loss lamented throughout the international art world that he had done much, through his reverberant exhibitions and books, to shape. At that point, four of his longtime colleagues — Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the New Museum; artist Glenn Ligon; Mark Nash, an art history professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz; and Naomi Beckwith, a senior curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and soon-to-be deputy director and chief curator at the Guggenheim Museum — banded together to realize his show. Working from his notes and conversations with him, they gathered the art he had specified, made some additions of their own and published a catalog.
When I looked through the book in advance of the opening, I had reservations about the project. Most of the 37 Black artists included are familiar and widely exhibited, as are some of the individual works. I wondered if the show, even with the gravity of its theme, wouldn’t end up feeling, basically, like not much more than a reaffirmation of a contemporary art canon, a cavalcade of stars.
But curating, at its best, is far less about singularity than it is about synthesis, about the alchemy of bringing things together to ignite and amplify ideas. Enwezor had a genius eye for such creative fusion, and it has produced exceptionally moving results in an exhibition that will surely rank as one of the most important of 2021. It is a fitting tribute to its maker, an honor to a team that saw it through, and a worthy frame for the artists who contributed to it — among them some of the greatest we have.
The title lays out the show’s intertwined themes: black grief in response to white racist aggression, and white grievance fueled by a feared loss of dominance and control. A sense of their volatile chemistry is distilled on the New Museum’s facade in a Glenn Ligon text piece that spells out, in large white neon letters, the phrase “blues blood bruise,” words extracted from an interview with a Black New York City teenager, Daniel Hamm, who in 1964 was arrested and brutally beaten by the police.
The theme of racial tension is picked up immediately inside the museum. For a conceptual work titled “Presumption of guilt,” artist Cameron Rowland has rigged the entrance door with an alert bell of a kind used in commercial shops to warn owners of the presence of potentially larcenous customers.
And another artist, Adam Pendleton, has covered the lobby walls with silk-screen images that include graffiti-style signage, a form of public writing often associated, in the white-dominated news media, with urban lawlessness and, by implication, a Black presence. Pendleton pointedly plays on these expectations by incorporating examples of graffiti protesting the 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Enwezor was allergic to narrow-gauge readings of categories like “political art” and “protest art” (and, for that matter, “Black art”). He favored subtlety, ambiguity, purposeful indirection — all evident in different ways, and to different degrees, in the work of three artists in the lobby gallery who introduce themes that will reverberate through the main exhibition spaces on the museum’s second, third and fourth floors.
A short narrative film, “Alone” by Garrett Bradley, dramatizes the engulfing emotional cost of Black mass incarceration by viewing it through the eyes of a young woman whose lover is in jail. A ready-made sculpture by the remarkable Tiona Nekkia McClodden, consisting of a steel contraption commercially used to hold cattle about to be slaughtered, speaks, in the context of this exhibition, to the murderous realities of slavery. And a set of large photographs by Terry Adkins (1953-2014) of “memory jugs,” traditional relic-filled African American funerary objects, underscores the show’s function as both a monument to a rich, resilient culture and a memorial to what’s lost through racism — rights of citizenship, lives to COVID-19 — every day.
One of the show’s earliest pieces, installed on the second floor, is, in effect, a civil rights era reliquary. Titled “Freedom Now, Number I, August 13, 1963-January 14, 1964,” it’s an assemblage by Daniel LaRue Johnson (1938-2017) made in the months after the 1963 March on Washington when he was traveling through the American South. As he went, he picked up odds and ends (a broken doll, a mousetrap, a hacksaw blade and a “Freedom Now” protest button); attached them to a canvas; and smothered them in layers of black pitch, an everyday material that carried some terrible associations of bodies tarred and feathered and torched.
For Enwezor, this piece was one of the exhibition’s touchstone works, maybe because it adds a charge of you-were-there realness to other, newer works referring to the civil rights era. These include Dawoud Bey’s 2012 portrait series called “The Birmingham Project,” a memorial to the four young girls killed in the 1963 bombing, by Ku Klux Klan terrorists, of the city’s 16th Street Baptist Church; and Carrie Mae Weems’ hushed, funereal photographic reimaginings of key 1960s events. Her picture titled “The Assassination of Medgar, Malcolm and Martin” seems to be set in a morgue.
And if there’s a single indelible emblem of “mourning” in the show, it’s Nari Ward’s installation, “Peace Keeper” — originally made for the 1995 Whitney Biennial; subsequently destroyed; and recreated, at Enwezor’s request, for his show. Comprising a full-size, beat-up black hearse enclosed in a steel cage beneath a kind of thundercloud of rusted exhaust pipes and mufflers, it’s materially overpowering, even off-putting, a little scary. It’s only when you stand close that you see delicacy: The car’s surface is flecked with iridescent peacock feathers.
Is “Peace Keeper” a “political” work? Hard to say. On the one hand, it seems to set Blackness in an environment of entrapment, stalled motion and ruin. But then there are the stabbing traces of beauty: the feathers. The humiliation of tarring and feathering is evoked here too, but so is a message of flight. And there’s the title. This particular “peace keeper” looks to be a prisoner of war. All in all, the piece defies any easy reading. Materially, it’s almost too much, but conceptually, it’s elusive and in that sense almost abstract, as is true of much of the political art Enwezor valued.
There are strong examples of such art on the museum’s third floor. Howardena Pindell’s “Autobiography: Water (Ancestors/Middle Passage/Family Ghosts)” is one: a collage painting with the figure of the artist herself floating, in spectral outline, on an ocean littered with what looks like mortal wreckage — body parts, staring eyes. Another is Melvin Edwards’ great series of wall sculptures, “Lynch Fragments”; there are 10 examples in the show, each a fierce knot of welded-together spikes, chains and screws. And Charles Gaines’ multimedia “Manifestos 3” is a third. In it, the exhortative words of James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. have been converted into a musical score, recordings of which sound through the gallery.
Indeed, this show is as much an aural as a visual experience. Sound, in one form or another, is everywhere. Some of it is actually silent, as in the case of Jennie C. Jones’ exquisite line drawings collectively titled “Score for Sustained Blackness, Set 3.” Some is happenstantial: Microphones embedded in Kevin Beasley’s suspended sculpture “Strange Fruit (Pair 1)” pick up and amplify ambient gallery noise.
And there’s music, lots of it, on every floor. In the keening laments of jazz singer Alice Smith, as recorded on video by Kahlil Joseph. In Theaster Gates’ thunderous percussion jam with the Black Monks in a half-wrecked church. And in sometimes recorded, sometimes live piano improvisations emanating from a cabanalike installation by Rashid Johnson that’s part salon, part greenhouse and part Black history library.
The Johnson piece is on the fourth floor, along with abstract paintings by Mark Bradford and Julie Mehretu. Together, they form an ensemble bright and busy enough to suggest that maybe, by this point in the show, mourning is over, we’ve gotten beyond it, left it behind in the galleries below. Yet such an impression would not be entirely accurate.
The mural-size Bradford picture, it turns out, traces the contours of a government surveillance map of Black neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Issued in the wake of the 1965 Watts rebellion, it was an example of cartography used as a tool for civic control. The four Mehretu paintings on view also carry political content. Half-hidden under abstract patterns in one is a drawing of an image of the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
But it’s another, less conspicuous fourth-floor piece that most powerfully encapsulates the karmic interlock — a plague of white aggrievement meeting an emergency of Black grief — that gives the show its theme.
The work is an assemblage painting by Jack Whitten (1939-2018) titled “Birmingham” and dated to 1964. Whitten was born in Alabama, was active in the civil rights movement there, and in 1959 fled the South, never to return. Which doesn’t mean he didn’t look back. In this small piece, done in the aftermath of the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, he did.
The main image is a clipped news photograph of an African American man at a protest being attacked — it looks like he’s being torn apart — by a white policeman with a dog. (It was after being beaten at such a protest that Whitten took a one-way bus North.) In the piece, the photo is encased, as if it were precious or radioactive, in a nest of molded aluminum foil. And the nest appears to have been half blown open, as if ripped by a detonation that been paused midblast.
Can the destruction in progress be stopped, or must it go forward? That’s the question that Enwezor, in his final, urgent show, insists we ask.

Just think how overwhelming it will be to see the New York Philharmonic onstage at Lincoln Center this fall — when, we hope, it returns after an 18-month absence. The coronavirus pandemic has taught us never again to take live music for granted.
Yet simply a return to normalcy in the music world will not do. The closures of concert halls and opera houses have revealed how fragile the economic support system for classical music actually is. Freelance artists have lost most of their work. Major institutions have been grappling not just with survival but also with questions of mission, relevance and inclusion — issues that became even more acute when nationwide demonstrations for racial justice broke out last year.
These questions are driving talks and planning at all U.S. performing arts institutions. But I’ve been thinking especially of our orchestras, which, for all their many admirable yet scattered efforts at innovation and outreach, remain reluctant to make fundamental changes to how their seasons are presented. It’s 2021, and we are still debating how to reinvent the orchestra for the 21st century.
“For next season, we must question ourselves,” Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic’s chief executive, said in an interview. “How have we changed, in light of the internal and external journey our nation has been on?”
Now is the moment for orchestras to think big and take chances — yes, even as many players have agreed to salary reductions and administrators are coping with crushing deficits. Conceptually it’s not so hard. Approaching programming with exciting new ideas, fostering music by living composers, finding looser ways to organize a season, educating audiences both in the halls and in communities — all have been kicked around for decades.
It starts with creative programming, which isn’t just important; it’s everything. I’ve long argued that American orchestras think too much about how they play and not enough about what they play and why they’re playing it. Programming an orchestra season is usually presented as a balancing act between maintaining the standard repertory while fostering contemporary music. But this makes it seem like old and new music exist in separate realms. Music is music; old and new music should be part of an integrated approach.
The most dynamic American orchestras have understood this for years. The San Francisco Symphony, under conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, brought renegade “American mavericks” like Charles Ives, John Cage, Carl Ruggles and Lou Harrison into the orchestra’s bloodstream. The Los Angeles Philharmonic is more or less alone in giving contemporary work an equal platform. I was heartened by the pluck the New York Philharmonic showed in taking a pass on a massive celebration of Ludwig van Beethoven’s 250th anniversary last year. Instead, the orchestra chose to focus on another milestone, the centennial of the 19th Amendment, by inaugurating Project 19, a multiyear venture to commission works from 19 female composers.
And after last year’s Black Lives Matter demonstrations and protests against police brutality, U.S. arts institutions felt compelled to look within, including — especially — the white-dominated field of classical music. There were calls for the art form to immediately grapple with a legacy of neglect. Orchestras have a responsibility to commission composers of color, to program works by such composers from earlier times and to hire Black and Latino conductors and soloists — and empower them to leave their mark on programming.
But perhaps the biggest impediment to creative programming and fresh thinking — including broader racial representation — remains the subscription-series schedule that prevails at all major American orchestras and locks them into standard-issue, week-after-week programs loaded with the classics and sprinkled, at best, with unusual or new choices. This structure has continued even as subscriber numbers have fallen. Most people, and not just younger ones, have become accustomed to more flexibility in planning their entertainment. The idea of committing yourself to a regularly scheduled night at your local concert hall feels odd and constraining.
In 2014, Alan Gilbert, then the Philharmonic’s music director, tried to put a hopeful spin on this shift. “It’s forcing our planning to be inspired and compelling,” he said. “We have to sell individual events. It’s hard, but there’s a great part of that.”
He lamented the rigidity orchestras must contend with when subscription programs are scheduled years in advance. “I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve torn our hair out during meetings, saying, ‘If only we could be nimble on our feet, change a program on a dime,’” he said.
Why can’t orchestras be nimble and respond to sudden inspiration or current events? If the Pittsburgh Symphony has a hit with a premiere, why must audiences in other cities wait years to hear it? When a major composer dies, imagine if an orchestra were able to organize, on short notice, a minifestival of his or her scores. If halls had been open during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, I’d like to believe that some scheduled programs could have been altered to present recent and long-overlooked pieces by Black composers.
The subscription model need not be discarded completely. Portions of a season could be planned in advance and sold as a series. Imagine a survey of the six Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky symphonies on six consecutive programs, each paired with a mid-20th-century Russian score or a new piece composed in response to Tchaikovsky. But this series, in my mind, would be offered not over six weeks, but over a week or two, festival style.
Most subscription programs are repeated three, sometimes four times. But certain programs could actually run longer, if not for the tyranny of subscription scheduling. I bet Riccardo Muti conducting the Chicago Symphony in a concert performance of a Giuseppe Verdi opera could sell 10 performances. On the other hand, the Boston Symphony could offer a concentrated celebration of Boston composers, with 10 programs over two weeks, each performed just once, pairing composers who once loomed large in the city — Leon Kirchner, Gunther Schuller, Donald Martino — with diverse emerging composers from the region.
When imaging how orchestras could thrive in the future, the spaces they perform in are pivotal. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, the “most important orchestra in America — period,” as my colleague Zachary Woolfe argued convincingly in 2017, would doubtless have been less successful at tying its mission to education and social justice without having Walt Disney Concert Hall, a Frank Gehry-designed masterpiece, as its home. In addition to its gleaming, glorious auditorium, Disney Hall has all sorts of smaller spaces, even nooks and crannies in the winding lobbies, where visitors can be engaged by talks and intimate performances.
Borda, who oversaw the creation of Disney Hall, is now working on a major renovation of the New York Philharmonic’s David Geffen Hall. When the pandemic put an end to concerts, it seemed possible that the Geffen project might be put on hold. But implicitly acknowledging the challenges of seeing the renovation through, Borda doubled down, ceding some day-to-day operations to colleagues so she could focus on leading the Geffen effort.
The larger goals of the project are more important than ever, she insists. “How can we amplify, employ and design a space so it truly is a gateway, a welcoming port for the community?” she said in the recent interview. The new Geffen Hall will have, she added, a “new flexibility to allow us to produce events we haven’t dreamed of yet.”
There will be a welcome center and expanded lobbies; a Sidewalk Studio where passersby will be able to see performances and activities taking place. Best of all, the expanded front lobby will have a wall devoted to screening performances. And it will be possible to open three sides of the lobby to the plaza to allow people to wander in and out.
I’d go further. Why not broadcast the orchestra’s rehearsals during the day to show the public what musicians’ work entails? The lobby could also be a space where players from the orchestra, composers and conductors present short performances and talks during the day.
Borda emphasized that any increased programming flexibility won’t matter if the Philharmonic doesn’t transform its hall into an acoustically vibrant, intimate-feeling and appealing space. Giving concerts, after all, is what orchestras do.

‘I’m Speaking Out:’ Calgary Firefighters Allege Decades of Racism

When Chris Coy became Calgary, Alberta’s first Black firefighter 25 years ago, his heroic vision of the profession was almost immediately upended.
First, he said, during training he was hazed more than his colleagues, strapped to a stretcher against his will and repeatedly doused with a fire hose. Then there were the co-workers who ostracized him at lunch. Throughout his career, he said, fellow firefighters used a racial slur directed at Black people.
For years, Coy said he suffered in silence, as he feared speaking out would mean dismissal or, worse, other firefighters not shielding him from danger in the field.
But since retiring in December, Coy has begun speaking publicly about what he said was decades of racially motived physical and verbal abuse, joining a group of current and former firefighters who have been voicing similar grievances. The city’s mayor and fire chief have acknowledged the racism within the department and pledged to address it.
“Here in Canada we are proud and sometimes smug about our commitment to diversity,” Naheed Nenshi, Calgary’s mayor, said in an interview. “I don’t want anyone who gets a paycheck I sign to feel that they aren’t valued because of the color of their skin.”
In Canada, a country that prides itself on its liberal humanism and multiculturalism, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made reconciling with Indigenous peoples an early priority of his premiership. Now the country has been undergoing a national reckoning about institutional racism in its city halls, law enforcement and cultural institutions, particularly since the global uprising for Black rights spurred by last year’s police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Brenda Lucki, the chief of Canada’s storied national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was recently forced to walk back her previous denials of systemic racism within the force. Trudeau was among those arguing that police forces across the country were grappling with systemic racism.
While there have been complaints of discrimination in other fire departments in Canada, Calgary has become a high-profile case. The accusations of racism at the fire department were first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the national broadcaster.
Nenshi said that while Calgary had evolved into one of Canada’s most diverse cities, people of color and women were woefully underrepresented in the fire department. Of 1,400 firefighters in the department, he said, only 40 were women; the city does not track minority numbers.
The department has conducted two internal reviews of workplace culture that have not been made public; the mayor cited the need for employee confidentiality. An internal investigation into racism is also underway, Adam Noble-Johnson, a spokesperson for the mayor, said Wednesday.
Calgary’s fire chief, Steve Dongworth, said in an interview that he was proud the fire department had counted Coy among its ranks and stressed that all accusations of racism, bullying and sexism were thoroughly investigated. He declined to comment on individual complaints.
“I have to acknowledge that we live in a society where ingrained racism and sexism exists, and this extends to the Calgary Fire Department,” he said. “We are predominantly a Caucasian male department, and we are trying to change that.”
Alberta, an oil and cattle center in the country’s west, has long been billed as “the Texas of Canada.” It is a province where socially conservative political parties dominate and where a highlight of the year is the annual Calgary Stampede, the world’s largest outdoor rodeo.
But decades of migration have transformed the social fabric and politics of Calgary, Alberta’s biggest city, which elected a Muslim mayor more than a decade ago. Today, about one-third of the city’s residents are Black, people of color or Indigenous, according to City Hall.
Coy said tensions between the old and new Alberta had boiled over into racism at the fire department, Canada’s third-largest, where, he said, a culture of nepotism still held sway.
This summer, after thousands of anti-racism protesters took to the streets of Calgary, the city held three days of public hearings on the issue of local systemic racism.
Among those testifying was Shannon Pennington, a veteran firefighter. He described an episode about a decade ago, when a large pink panther stuffed toy was smeared with black shoe polish on its face and hands, and hung with a rope around its neck from the rafters of Calgary’s Fire Station 5. The toy was wearing a uniform belonging to a Black firefighter.
“It was a mock lynching,” said Coy, who said he counseled the Black firefighter. “I was outraged, but the victim didn’t want to do anything because he feared a backlash.” The alleged victim did not return phone calls.
Elder Doreen Spence, 83, an Indigenous nurse who counsels minority firefighters, also testified about the case of Barry Dawson, an Indigenous firefighter, who rose to the rank of captain and who took his own life in November 2017 at age 47. Spence, who had dinner with Dawson the night before he died, said in an interview that he had told her about being bullied repeatedly about his hair, which he wore long to honor his culture.
“He told me he had PTSD from the job, and the constant bullying and verbal abuse exacerbated it,” she said in an interview. (The fire department said Dawson had been asked to cut his hair during training, in line with regulations, but later was allowed to wear it long).
Following the hearings, a group of current and former minority firefighters, led by Coy, wrote a letter to Dongworth, saying they had faced an “extremely toxic” environment at work.
“We have been ostracized, humiliated, degraded, slandered, undermined, ignored, verbally and physically assaulted,” the letter said.
They made nine demands, including calling for the creation of an independent body to investigate workplace abuses.
While firefighters the world over are revered as heroes, Carrie Edwards-Clemons, president of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, said the issues in Calgary reflected a global challenge in a profession dominated by a white old boy network.
“The difference now is that the world is paying attention, and people are saying, ‘Enough is enough,’” said Edwards-Clemons, who is deputy chief of Flint, Michigan’s fire department.
In Canada, Coy said he was determined that discrimination at fire departments come out of the shadows.
The son of Jamaican immigrants who came to Canada in the 1960s, Coy, 60, previously taught English literature to college students. As a firefighter, he went to the scene of a lethal explosion at an oil recycling plant, rescued children with their necks stuck in playground equipment and worked on a recovery team pulling dead bodies out of the river.
He said the racism at the department was never far beneath the surface. If basketball was playing on the fire station’s television, he said colleagues would say, “Why are we watching N-word ball?”
Even after training, he said, he was blocked by superiors from attending fire emergencies, with no explanation.
In 2013, he said he was promoted to captain of a station near Calgary’s airport on the basis of seniority. His colleagues stopped using the racial slur in front of him, he said, but he would still overhear them using it.
Anwer Amery, a retired Calgary firefighter with Middle Eastern roots, said he never considered himself a visible minority member until he began to work for the department.
As a young recruit, he said, other firefighters called him the “Snake charmer,” “Turban twister” and “a sand N-word.”
“People asked if I ate sand lizards,” he recalled, saying he was singled out for menial tasks like scrubbing the walls of the station. He said physical abuse followed, including being spit on and having wet rags thrown at him. When he complained to superiors, he said they laughed.
After he was promoted to captain in 2010, he said he routinely faced insubordination from other firefighters. “I was the person in charge of emergencies, so if people disobeyed or walked away, it was dangerous for the public and other responders,” he said.
After a junior employee who had refused to obey his orders complained to the firefighters union about him, he said, he was suddenly suspended by the department without cause. He said he was eventually offered a settlement of $17,500 from the city, which he refused, and lost out on at least $200,000 in wages. Distraught, he retired in 2016.
“I’m speaking out to stop this from happening again,” he said.

NEW YORK — In the nearly seven years since Eric Garner died at the hands of police in Staten Island, his mother, Gwen Carr, has helped turn her son’s cries of “I can’t breathe” into a national movement against discriminatory policing.
Carr has also become a sought-after endorser for political hopefuls looking to represent themselves as candidates of change, especially on policing matters.
That is especially true in New York City’s crowded Democratic primary for mayor, where several candidates have been coveting Carr’s endorsement in the wake of the national protests that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year.
But instead of giving her endorsement to one of the more liberal, progressive Democratic candidates, Carr will announce Thursday that she will endorse Raymond J. McGuire, a former Wall Street executive who served on the New York City Police Foundation and who has embraced calls to reform the police, but not defund them.
McGuire, formerly the vice chairman at Citigroup, is a moderate Democrat who was recruited to run by the city’s business community and quickly raised $5 million in three months. But he still must overcome his lack of name recognition among most voters and expand his appeal beyond the Wall Street elite.
Carr’s endorsement could help McGuire with some left-leaning voters and shore up support in the Black community, which makes up 26% of the electorate.
“Eric Garner and George Floyd are examples of what can happen to any Black man in this country and what has happened to all too many Black men in this city,” McGuire said in an interview. “Gwen Carr’s endorsement means she recognizes that I have what it takes to lead this city and to reflect the voice of those who would not otherwise have a voice.”
Carr said the next mayor can only undertake the necessary police accountability reforms if the city’s future and finances are stabilized.
“We know that the budget is in a mess, and from what I read he can balance budgets,” Carr said. “I have grandsons and granddaughters growing up in this city, and I want it to be a safer place for them.”
McGuire, who is Black, has adopted a policing stance that echoes that of Black lawmakers in the city who resisted calls to defund the police last year, citing rising violence in the communities they represent.
“Black people want better policing. We want to reform, restructure and reallocate the dollars,” McGuire said. “We want our policing to be respectful, accountable and proportionate.”
Garner was killed in 2014 after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer, Daniel Pantaleo. A grand jury did not indict Pantaleo, and federal prosecutors decided against pursuing civil rights charges. Pantaleo remained on the police force for five more years until he was fired and stripped of his pension in 2019 by the police commissioner at the time, James P. O’Neill, after a police administrative judge found him guilty of violating a departmental ban on chokeholds.
Carr said that her pursuit for justice in her son’s death was caught up in politics. She has been critical of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision to delay a departmental trial and not fire Pantaleo. The mayor was elected in 2013 on a promise to overhaul the relationship between the New York Police Department and Black, brown and poor communities.
“He has never been a politician,” Carr said of McGuire. “We need new blood.”
Carr said she admired McGuire’s support of the National Action Network, the civil rights organization headed by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The group has been one of her biggest supporters since her son’s death. Sharpton has credited McGuire as one of many anonymous Black businessmen who had helped fund his organization during difficult times.
McGuire’s campaign will reveal the endorsement Thursday in a digital ad created by John Del Cecato, who is responsible for the successful 2013 campaign ad that featured de Blasio’s son, Dante; and Mark Skidmore, chief executive of Assemble the Agency, who wrote the script for McGuire’s campaign launch video that was narrated by Spike Lee.
In the nearly two-minute ad, McGuire and Carr visit the location in Staten Island where Garner had his fatal interaction with police. Carr holds onto McGuire’s arm as they walk toward the location, which is commemorated with a plaque and a mural. He refers to her as “Mother Carr”; she calls him “Mr. McGuire,” but he tells her to call him Ray.
Her endorsement will be a disappointment to other candidates such as Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Maya Wiley, a civil rights lawyer who was de Blasio’s legal counsel and former head of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, said Susan Kang, an associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
“There are some moderates in the reform criminal justice world for whom this will carry a great deal of legitimacy, particularly those of Ray McGuire’s and Gwen Carr’s generation who are very likely voters,” Kang said. “Trust is an important issue among older voters, and that group makes up a high percentage of people who turn out to vote in municipal primaries.”

On the Biggest Stage, the NFL Muddled Its Feel-Good Message

The NFL likes to project power and precision. Sideline catches are scrutinized with zoom lenses, first downs are measured in inches and Air Force jets fly over stadiums just as “The Star-Spangled Banner” reaches its peak.
But when it comes to topics like race, health and safety, the league’s certainty dissolves into a series of mixed messages.
That was the case Sunday at the Super Bowl, the NFL’s crowning game, which is typically watched by about 100 million viewers in the United States. The championship game provides the league a massive platform each year to promote itself as America’s corporate do-gooder, with the best interests of its enormous fan base at heart. That was harder to do this year as the country remained roiled by the coronavirus pandemic, which has exacerbated festering political division and racial unrest, issues the NFL had to plow past to complete its season.
On Sunday, the NFL trumpeted its support for the fight against social injustice. The national anthem was performed by two musicians, one Black and one white. The poet Amanda Gorman, who wowed the country with her recitation at President Biden’s inauguration, read an ode to the three honorary captains — a teacher, a nurse and a soldier — front-line workers in different fields. The TV announcers spoke often of the work that the league and the players have done to battle racial inequities.
Yet, moments later, when the Kansas City Chiefs took the field, the NFL played a recording in the reduced-capacity stadium of the made-up war cry that is a team custom. The prompt got fans to swing their arms in a “tomahawk chop,” an act that many find disrespectful and a perpetuation of racist stereotypes of the nation’s first people. Last week, the Kansas City Indian Center, a social service agency, put up two billboards in the city that read, “Change the name and stop the chop!”
“At the start of the game it was all unify, unify, unify, and then there’s this racist chant,” said Louis Moore, an associate professor of history at Grand Valley State University who studies connections between race and sports. “Eight months after George Floyd, and you’ve done all this stuff, letting players put phrases on the backs of their helmets, giving workers a paid holiday for Juneteenth. They are putting a corporate Band-Aid on a problem instead of dealing with it.”
Moore pointed to other inconvenient realities that were either dismissed, ignored or obscured by the relentless messaging.
There was scant mention of Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has not played since the 2016 season, when he began kneeling during the national anthem to shine a light on police brutality.
That led to a sharp, viral rebuke on Twitter from singer Mariah Carey.
There was little talk of the league’s abysmal record hiring people of color as head coaches and general managers even as television cameras showed the Chiefs’ successful offensive coordinator, Eric Bieniemy, who is Black and has been unable to land a head coaching position in multiple hiring cycles.
Before the game, CBS Sports showed a segment that featured Viola Davis, the Academy Award-winning actress, saluting Kenny Washington, a Black player who in 1946 reintegrated the NFL, which had an unofficial color barrier for 13 years.
Yet there was no discussion of a lawsuit brought by two former NFL players who accuse the league of rigging the concussion settlement to make it harder for Black players to receive payments.
The league spent considerable time lauding nurses and other health care workers on the front lines who have been helping fight the coronavirus. It had invited 7,500 vaccinated workers to the game, a signal to Americans that if you, too, get inoculated, you will be able to safely attend big events like the Super Bowl.
Not discussed was that just hosting the Super Bowl could lead to a spike in the number of infections. Sure, the NFL provided fans at the game with face masks and hand sanitizer, but little if any contact tracing was done to monitor exposure. Tracking infected fans will be made all the more difficult as people return to their homes in all corners of the country.
The Super Bowl, U.S. sports’ biggest party, is not confined to TV and phone screens. The week of events leading up to the game was a magnet for tens of thousands of fans who attended parties or flocked to Tampa’s bars and restaurants, often unmasked. After the home team’s victory, maskless revelers took to the streets of Tampa, an utterly predictable scene that has followed other major championships. Many of the people who celebrated without regard to social distancing or other guidelines will expose others to the virus as they travel home to all corners of the country.
For all the NFL’s feel-good words and gestures to this moment in U.S. history at the Super Bowl, and its attempts to use football to try to bring the nation together, the league’s carefully crafted message risked being muddled by its actions.

New York's Top Judge Says 'Zero Tolerance' for Racism in Court System: [National Desk]

Full text: A Buffalo area court officer did not face a disciplinary hearing after he wrote a Facebook post saying George Floyd "deserved what he got."
Just days after George Floyd's death, a court officer in New York posted two pictures side-by-side on his Facebook page.
The first image was already instantly recognizable: Mr. Floyd, face down, with a police officer kneeling on his neck. The second showed the N.F.L. player Colin Kaepernick, kneeling to bring attention to instances of police brutality against Black people, among other forms of racism.
"What kneeling one offends you more?" a prewritten caption read.
"Clearly the football player," the court officer wrote in response. "I'm sure the suspect deserved what he got."
The officer, who is from the Buffalo area and has been working for the court system for almost a decade, was not fired after another employee brought the post to the attention of the inspector general's office. He was not ordered to undergo a disciplinary hearing or required to take sensitivity training. Although he was suspended for a month, he has since returned to the job.
This week, New York's chief judge, Janet DiFiore, said that settling the matter without a more thorough accounting had been a "mistake." In a memo to the roughly 1,350 judges and 14,000 other employees of the state court, she wrote that such settlements "inevitably fosters a perception that such conduct, though penalized, is tolerated within our ranks. It is not."
Judge DiFiore said, going forward, any case involving claims of discriminatory conduct would necessitate a full disciplinary hearing, the system's equivalent of a trial. The officials who had been involved in the decision to settle the officer's case would be "participating in immediate anti-bias training," the judge said.
A court spokesman, Lucian Chalfen, said that Judge DiFiore and the state's chief administrative judge, Lawrence Marks, had not known how the case had been handled until after it was reported on by the New York Law Journal in late January. "They were extremely displeased about it," he said.
Mr. Chalfen said that he was barred from revealing the identity of the officer who wrote the racist post. But he said Judge DiFiore's learning of the lenient measures taken against him had led to her memo.
The Civil Service Employees Association, the union which represents the officer, would not comment on the specifics of the case, other than to say in a statement that it did not "condone discrimination of any form, and we completely agree with the overall premise that workers deserve a court system free of any discrimination or bias."
It said that the change proposed in the Judge's memo "clearly diminishes worker rights and may violate our contract." It also said that it was investigating whether the proposed change was illegal.
The New York court system's tolerance for racist conduct from its personnel has been a subject of heightened scrutiny since Mr. Floyd's death. On June 9, Judge DiFiore, spurred by Mr. Floyd's death, commissioned a report to look into institutional racism in the court system. The team tasked with the report was led by Jeh C. Johnson, a former Homeland Security secretary under President Obama.
Mr. Johnson's team found that racism was deeply embedded within the culture of New York's court officers, the state's term for the officials who keep order in the courts. (In some states, they are known as bailiffs.)
The team found specific instances of racist posts to social media, including one white officer who had posted a drawing of former President Barack Obama with a noose around his neck and another who referred to a Black colleague as "one of the good monkeys."
"The use of racial slurs by white court officers is common and often goes unpunished," the report also said.
Court officers of color told Mr. Johnson's team "they felt they could not report incidents of bias for fear of being ostracized by their fellow officers and facing adverse career consequences from powerful and entrenched union leaders." Union leadership itself, they said, was a "safe haven for racist speech and actions."
Law enforcement agencies throughout New York have had to contend with racism in their ranks this year. Earlier this week, a top New York police official was fired after an internal investigation found that he had posted racist rants targeting Black, Hispanic and Jewish people. (The official, Deputy Inspector James F. Kobel, whose role it was to combat workplace harassment within the department, has denied any wrongdoing.)
Judge DiFiore addressed the larger racism problem in the courts in her memo this week.
Racism and other offensive sentiments, the memo said, had an impact upon the courts that was "immediate, irreparable and completely unacceptable."
"Our approach to such behavior must be 'zero tolerance,"' Judge DiFiore wrote.

“Our approach to such behavior must be ‘zero tolerance,’” DiFiore wrote.

Full text: Most of the leading mayoral candidates have been wary of embracing the "defund the police" movement, which has lost some mainstream political momentum.
Nearly eight months ago, Scott M. Stringer stood in Brooklyn before an angry, unsettled gathering to memorialize the death of George Floyd. The best way to honor him, Mr. Stringer said, was to send a clear message to City Hall: "It's time to defund the N.Y.P.D. now."
But with the New York City mayoral primary looming in June, Mr. Stringer has distanced himself from the defund movement.
At a recent mayoral forum, Mr. Stringer was asked if he supported defunding the police, and whether he would commit to slashing the Police Department's $ 6 billion budget in half. He responded with a less drastic proposal to cut $ 1 billion, spread over four years, and said he did not want the city to return to a period of high crime like in the 1970s.
"I do remember when the A train was a rolling crime scene, and I don't want my children or any child to go back to that time and place," he said. "But I also know that overpolicing in communities of color has got to stop."
His remarks immediately drew fire.
"This is not what a progressive would say," said Lauren Ashcraft, a Democratic Socialist and former congressional candidate in Queens. Other progressives questioned whether several leading Democratic candidates had the courage and commitment to win their support.
The escalating tensions over the issue highlight the challenges that Democratic candidates face as they try to cultivate the city's growing progressive flank without embracing stances that may scare off moderate New Yorkers -- especially at a time when shootings and murders have sharply risen.
The issue cuts across racial and class lines: Two Black moderate Democratic candidates, Eric Adams and Raymond J. McGuire, have voiced concerns -- echoed among other Black lawmakers in the city -- that defunding the police would worsen crime in neighborhoods that suffer the most from violence.
Maya Wiley, a former top counsel for Mayor Bill de Blasio who gained a national following as an analyst for MSNBC, was often critical of the mayor's handling of policing. Now she appears to be recalibrating her message to avoid using the defund slogan.
"The word means different things to different people," Ms. Wiley said. "We should focus on the clarity of the demands."
Others in the wide-open Democratic field for mayor have sought to distance themselves from the defund movement and instead speak more of the need to bring meaningful change to the Police Department.
The debate over the defund movement has roiled the Democratic Party over concerns that the slogan scared away moderate voters during the election in November. Some Democratic leaders blamed candidates' embrace of the movement for the party's losses in the House.
President Barack Obama discouraged candidates from using the slogan -- arguing you have "lost a big audience the minute you say it" -- while leaders on the progressive left, like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, defended it and blamed moderates for running weak campaigns.
Even in Minneapolis, where Mr. Floyd was killed by the police, efforts to essentially dismantle the city's police department collapsed. A far less ambitious move -- cutting the police budget by 4.5 percent -- was approved in December, disappointing defund supporters.
In a survey of the nine leading Democratic mayoral hopefuls, only two said they supported the defund movement: Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, and Carlos Menchaca, a councilman from Brooklyn.
The race for mayor this year may be the city's most consequential in a generation, with New York facing a resurgence of the coronavirus that may prolong and worsen the city's economic crisis. The pandemic's effect on the city has overshadowed other issues on the campaign trail, including defunding the police.
Many of the campaigns have commissioned polls to measure which issues voters want the next mayor to prioritize, and they have consulted with policing experts about how to tackle reforms. Keeping New Yorkers safe from the pandemic was the top concern in one poll; defunding the police was not among the Top 10 issues, with voters caring more about keeping crime down.
"A lot of people, including in communities impacted by policing, bristle at the term," Barry Friedman, a professor and director of the Policing Project at New York University School of Law, said of the defund slogan. "There are people who are frustrated at how police respond to situations, but don't think they're going to be safer without the police."
Still, many left-leaning leaders in New York are committed to trying to keep defund efforts alive. Two advocacy groups and one union -- Make the Road Action, Community Voices Heard Power and 1199 Service Employees International Union -- plan to unveil an independent expenditure committee to make the defund movement one of the top issues in the mayor's race.
The New York City Democratic Socialists of America, which helped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez win her primary in 2018, intends to make a concerted push to make defunding the police a key issue, according to the group's co-chairwoman, Sumathy Kumar.
Tiffany Cabán, a progressive-backed City Council candidate who nearly scored an upset win in the 2019 Democratic primary for Queens district attorney, wrote a 40-page public safety platform that is expected to be the philosophical basis that defund supporters running for mayor or City Council organize around.
Ms. Cabán has spoken with Ms. Morales, Ms. Wiley and Mr. Stringer about what proponents of defunding the police want. She said she often had to tell candidates that their positions did not go far enough and believes that will change.
"There will be a domino effect," she said. "One of the big, more forward-facing mayoral candidates is going to release their comprehensive police plan, and everyone else is going to have an answer to it."
Mr. Stringer, who has won endorsement from several progressive leaders who support the defund movement, said that he was "the first elected official to put forth a detailed proposal to reduce the N.Y.P.D.'s budget by $ 1 billion," and that his "position on these issues has not changed."
But when asked directly whether he supports defunding the police, Mr. Stringer gave a more indirect answer, saying that he wanted to "make concrete change when it comes to systemic racism and our criminal justice system."
Mr. Stringer will soon release a report that explains his policy ideas to transform policing that he says is more ambitious than his proposal in June. The report, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, does not mention the word "defund" or cite a dollar figure for budget cuts, but it outlines how he would move certain responsibilities away from the Police Department and identifies specific areas for reinvestment in communities.
Most of the other major candidates seemed even less likely to make major cuts to the police budget.
Mr. McGuire, who served on the New York City Police Foundation, has called for "better policing with greater accountability, not fewer police officers," even as he has said that as a Black man he could "easily be the next George Floyd" -- a contrast that he does not view as a contradiction.
Mr. Adams, a former police officer, said that he does not "support taking resources away from crime fighting -- especially in communities of color where shootings and other predatory crimes are on the rise."
Ms. Wiley said at a recent mayoral forum that the Police Department budget was "bloated," but declined to say how much she would seek to cut police spending.
"I don't have a number for you, but that's because it has been such a black box," Ms. Wiley said. "There really is so little transparency about what and how the budget is spent."
Kathryn Garcia, the city's former sanitation commissioner, has called for "police reform through strict accountability and structural change," including raising the minimum age of recruits to 25 and holding "police officers accountable for depraved acts with a zero-tolerance policy."
Shaun Donovan, the former federal housing secretary and budget director, called for a reduction in "overpolicing" and reinvestment in "wraparound social services."
Andrew Yang, a former presidential candidate, said the Police Department needs resources to address rising crime, but he supported shifting some of its funding to other city agencies that could better handle certain issues.
"Not every problem requires an armed police officer," Mr. Yang said.
Last year was New York City's bloodiest in nearly a decade with more than 460 homicides; the number of shooting victims doubled to more than 1,500. Mr. de Blasio and police leaders have blamed the economic losses and upheaval of the pandemic.
Murders surged in Black and Latino neighborhoods including East Harlem, East New York in Brooklyn, Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, and areas near Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. In the 73rd Precinct in Brooklyn, which includes Brownsville and where about 70 percent of residents are Black, there were 25 murders last year, compared with 11 in 2019.
The June 22 Democratic primary will take place just days before the City Council's deadline to approve the budget for the next fiscal year, all but assuring that the push to defund will be in the public and political discourse.
Last June, the defund effort led the city to pass a budget that called for the Police Department to suffer " $ 1 billion in cuts and cost shifts," according to the mayor. But an analysis by the Independent Budget Office concluded that a smaller portion of the police budget was actually cut, and some of the losses were spread out over a number of years.
Mr. Menchaca voted against that budget because it failed to cut $ 1 billion from the Police Department; he said he plans to raise the issue during upcoming Council budget negotiations.
The defund movement, he said, "is going to be on the ballot."
Ms. Morales said she reached out to the Brooklyn Movement Center last summer to get a sense of what defund advocates expected from the next mayor. She now wants to cut $ 3 billion from the police budget -- a position that has won her support among defund advocates.
"We need to take that money and invest it in meeting people's needs," she said at a recent mayoral forum.
Anthonine Pierre, deputy director of the Brooklyn Movement Center and a member of Communities United for Police Reform, one of the architects of the city's defund movement, said that she was not surprised that more mainstream candidates have not reached out to her group because they think of "defund the police" as a communications strategy.
"Scott Stringer has had over a two-decade career in New York City politics, and never has police accountability been a banner issue for him," said Ms. Pierre, who worked for Mr. Stringer in 2008 when he was the Manhattan borough president.
"There is really a lack of courage from these candidates," she said, adding that she would welcome discussions with the mayoral field -- or a direct message on Twitter.
"My DMs are open," she said.

Since news of the first death during the Capitol riot Jan. 6 broke — which is to say, before the riot was even over — lawmakers, television personalities and countless regular people on social media have been saying that the rioters have blood on their hands.
The law does, in fact, provide a way to hold people accountable for deaths they did not directly cause, like that of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer while attempting to enter a restricted area.
But the felony murder rule, as it is called, is a limited provision that has raised a host of legal and moral questions about complicity and fairness.
In its broadest terms, the felony murder rule holds a person who commits a crime responsible for any deaths that result.
Michael Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, has said that felony murder charges are among those under consideration in the sprawling federal investigation, which has resulted in more than 180 arrests.
Although five people, including a Capitol Police officer, lost their lives in the siege, the most serious charges so far include weapons possession, assault of police officers, conspiracy to impede the certification of the vote and conspiracy to obstruct law enforcement.
Over the weekend, authorities arrested Zachary Alam, who is accused of using a helmet to break the window through which Babbitt was trying to climb when she was fatally shot. He was charged with multiple offenses including assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon.
“Just the gamut of cases and criminal conduct we’re looking at is really mind-blowing,” Sherwin said in a news conference Jan. 12. “This is only the beginning.”
Felony murder is a vestige of British common law that many other countries have abolished. It has been used in the United States in ways that have been widely decried, such as charging young people who are not the central participants in a crime.
In other circumstances, like when police officers are accused of killing unjustly, prosecutors have turned to the felony murder rule as a way to avoid having to prove malice aforethought.
It is difficult to tell how often the felony murder rule is used in federal prosecutions because it is lumped in with all other first-degree murder charges, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which tracks convictions and sentences.
Any such charges stemming from the Capitol siege will be highly dependent on the facts that emerge and what prosecutors think a jury will accept.
“Prosecutors don’t like to charge crimes where the law hasn’t clearly established that the charges will stand,” said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney who now teaches at the University of Alabama School of Law. “So that concern will have to be weighed against the seriousness of the circumstances.”
The classic example of felony murder is an armed robbery in which one robber shoots and kills someone.
Prosecutors can charge both the triggerman and his accomplices with first-degree murder, regardless of premeditation or intent to kill.
States have wide variance in what their felony murder laws require. Some say that the death must have been foreseeable or committed “in furtherance of” the crime. In a robbery using guns, for example, objective people would most likely agree that death was a foreseeable outcome.
Federal law lists 11 crimes that can serve as a basis for felony murder: arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery.
Legal experts say the one most likely to apply in the Capitol riot is burglary, defined as entering a building with the intent to commit an additional crime. Simply having entered the Capitol unlawfully would not be enough, and intent is difficult to prove.
Beyond that, there are other significant hurdles, said Guyora Binder, an expert on felony murder at the University at Buffalo School of Law. One is the question of who qualifies as an accomplice.
“Let’s say you enter with the intent to commit one crime, and half an hour later I enter with the intent to commit another crime and we never see each other, and I’ve never heard of you,” he said. “So we’re both committing burglaries, but we’re not committing the same burglary. I’m not your accomplice. You’re not my accomplice.”
Another wrinkle: Whether the death must be foreseeable or in furtherance of the underlying felony is “an open question” in federal law, Binder said, because courts have ruled different ways.
Still another question is raised by the deaths of Babbitt and Rosanne Boyland, who appears to have been trampled to death as fellow rioters fought their way into the building. A fourth person died after a stroke, and a fifth after a heart attack.
It is unclear whether the federal law allows for felony murder charges in a “third-party” death, such as one caused by a victim or, in Babbitt’s case, a law enforcement officer. Such cases are not unheard-of in state courts, although they are often among the most controversial uses of the felony murder rule.
In 2018, a teenage girl in Columbus, Ohio, was charged with felony murder when the police shot and killed her boyfriend in an undercover bust of an online robbery scheme in which she was accused of participating. In 2019, five teenagers suspected of attempting to steal a car in suburban Chicago were initially charged with felony murder after a sixth member of their group was shot and killed by the homeowner. After an outcry the charges were dropped.
Critics say felony murder has too often been used to assign culpability to peripheral figures in a crime, such as the getaway driver, or to overcharge young people who are particularly vulnerable to group pressure. Many countries that once had felony murder statutes have overturned them, and several states including California and Massachusetts have recently acted to sharply curtail their use.
But felony murder has also been used when the public has clamored for severe charges. Former police officers accused in the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, as well as the man who filmed the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia, have all been charged with felony murder, with assault as the underlying felony.
Both Georgia and Minnesota have particularly broad felony murder statutes. Federal law does not include assault as a triggering felony.
So in the death of Officer Brian Sicknick, who was overpowered and beaten by Capitol rioters, and died later at a hospital, those who assaulted him would have to be found to have caused his death during the commission of a different crime — or face a lesser homicide charge like second-degree murder. No one has been charged in the death of Sicknick, who lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda on Tuesday night.
The federal felony murder rule holds that the underlying purpose of the triggering felony has to be distinct from that of homicide — in other words, unintentionally killing someone in the course of a robbery or burglary may count as first-degree murder, but unintentionally killing someone while assaulting them does not. Robbery has the purpose of self-enrichment, while assault and murder share the purpose of causing harm.
“If I intend to commit an assault and the person dies, those are too closely related,” explained Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney who teaches at the University of Michigan Law School. “Prosecutors could inappropriately bootstrap the intent from the assault and convert it into a homicide in every single case.”
In the end, not all who entered the Capitol are going to be treated as equally culpable, McQuade said. Some may argue that they came in with the sole purpose of expressing their views, while others were clearly reckless and violent.
“I would think the prosecutor would perhaps weigh those two cases differently and would be more likely to file charges in the latter case, even though both might technically qualify,” she said.
