FERGUSON, Mo. — As an activist who jumped into the political arena after the police shooting of Michael Brown here six years ago, Cori Bush is accustomed to hard fights. She has been maced, shot at with rubber bullets and cloaked in tear gas at so many protests against police brutality that they have blurred together.
So when she heard that Rep. William Lacy Clay, the 10-term Democrat she is challenging in Missouri’s Democratic primary Tuesday, had called her “a prop” for the Justice Democrats, a national progressive group that exists to knock off titans of the party establishment such as himself, Bush did not miss a beat.
“I had no title, no name, came out of the Ferguson uprising and people know who I am across the world,” Bush said Saturday, responding to comments Clay made about her in an interview with The New York Times. “Not because I took money from some group — none of that. It is because I stayed true to a message of change for real people.”
Of Clay, she added, “He doesn’t understand that, because he doesn’t understand fighting for people.”
All over the country this summer, progressive candidates like Bush, 44, are doing battle with veteran incumbents over the identity of the Democratic Party. In New York City, Jamaal Bowman defeated Rep. Eliot L. Engel, a 16-term incumbent and powerful committee chairman. In western Massachusetts, Alex Morse, the mayor of Holyoke, is trying to unseat another long-serving chairman, Rep. Richard E. Neal.
Emboldened by a lethal pandemic that has shone a spotlight on systemic racial and economic inequality, and the swell of public support for the Black Lives Matter movement, they are seeking to sustain the momentum gathered in 2018 by insurgents, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who felled establishment figures. In St. Louis, Bush’s candidacy is a test of whether the protest movement can translate into hard electoral power on the federal level.
For Democratic leaders watching warily from Washington, Clay’s fate will also indicate whether the rise in progressive energy that has cost powerful white incumbents in places like the Bronx, Queens and Boston their seats can also dislodge a Black representative deep in the heartland of the country.
In few places have the intraparty battle lines glowed as brightly as greater St. Louis, a once-mighty industrial city plagued by economic malaise, a legacy of racial segregation and now spiking coronavirus cases, where the death of Brown in 2014 helped give rise to the movement on the left demanding a replacement for an incremental approach to governing.
The contest has grown exceedingly bitter, and Clay, 64, has come to view it not only as a fight for his own survival, but a chance to snuff out an upstart movement he sees as dangerously divisive. In an interview last week, the congressman suggested that the effort to unseat him by Bush, who is also Black, rests on a racist premise.
“The easy, racist way to lay it out is, ‘Look at Clay — what has he done for his district?’ ” he said, adding, “I fight for that district every single day.”
Clay accused the groups like Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress that have helped groom progressive primary challengers of targeting members of the Congressional Black Caucus specifically because “they think we are easy targets.”
“She’s a prop,” Clay said of Bush. “They use her to raise money to support their infrastructure.”
Clay has a powerful infrastructure of his own.
A Clay has represented part of St. Louis in Congress since 1969. William Lacy Clay Sr. was an icon of the civil rights movement in the city and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. When he retired nearly two decades ago, his son, William Lacy Clay Jr., inherited the seat and the loyalty of Black St. Louisans who have sent him back to Washington every two years since.
By some estimates, a majority of voters in the city have never voted for a congressman by any other name. Because Democrats so dominate this district, the real contest is fought each term in the Democratic primary, not the general election.
Clay is not bashful about his seniority in the Black Caucus and among the intensely hierarchical House Democratic Caucus, arguing that his easy access to the levers of power helps his district. He has the backing of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many of the party’s establishment pillars, like the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
“There is no substitute in life for substance,” he said. “Substance is so relevant to people. That’s why there’s been a Clay there for the last 52 years.”
After falling about 20 points short against Clay in 2018, Bush has come back with a better-funded and more aggressive campaign. A documentary that chronicled her 2018 campaign, as well as those of Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives, “Knock Down the House,” helped burnish her profile. Perhaps more important, her aides argue that in the current moment of national upheaval, more voters are beginning to understand the need for policy prescriptions she has long championed, like Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, a universal basic income and the wholesale dismantling of police departments.
At campaign events, Bush speaks vividly about her own battle with the coronavirus this spring — how her fingertips turned blue as she was deprived of oxygen, and her fear of the medical bills that would follow her two hospital stays — to bolster her arguments.
But her case against Clay centers on the protests that have rippled through St. Louis after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of the police in Minneapolis and Louisville. Bush’s brand of politics is built on being on the streets with everyday people. By her account, Clay has simply not showed up and proposed only half-measures to fix things.
“When we were getting our butts kicked and I was maced in the face in Florissant a few weeks ago and people were getting beat on by police officers — no, no,” she said. “Did he show up the next day to say, ‘You can’t do this in my district, you can’t treat people this way?’ No, no.”
That message has won Bush the avid backing of a loosely affiliated coalition of activists, young people of color and white progressives enraged by the events of the past several months.
Jasnaam Singh, 23, who was among almost a dozen volunteers who showed up at a school parking lot in Ferguson to canvass for Bush on an unseasonably cool Saturday morning, said he first encountered her through a network of supporters for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and then noticed her showing up on the streets again and again this summer, after the death of Floyd.
“Right then and there, I knew that she was a voice that the movement desperately needed to be heard in D.C.,” he said.
For those who have tended the protest movement since Ferguson — watching as Black activists and reformers have slowly gained footholds in City Hall here, the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office and in Jefferson City, the state capital — a victory by Bush would mark a milestone of another magnitude.
“She would fit right in as somebody who is pushing for the systematic change that we need, and not the small tedious change that we see,” said Rasheen Aldridge, an activist who won a seat in the Missouri Legislature last year.
The challenge for Bush has been persuading more moderate voters — Black and otherwise — to take a chance on a relative political novice who is unapologetically pushing for far-left policies like defunding the police.
Clay may not be wildly popular in the district, political analysts said, but he is not unpopular either and is considered a safe choice among the older Black voters who make up the voting base. And unlike Rep. Joseph Crowley, who lost to Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, or Engel, Clay is a Black man in a plurality Black district.
Antonio French, a former alderman and mayoral candidate from St. Louis’ North Side, said he had noticed a “disconnect” between the progressive politics of many white voters and young activists of color rallying behind Bush and those of Black voters in his neighborhood.
“Defund and get rid of the police is not a message I hear from average voters in my ward or districts like mine,” French said. “It’s quite the opposite. If you go to a Black neighborhood ward meeting, primarily you are hearing people complain about the lack of police in that neighborhood.”
Clay points out that after Ferguson, he encouraged the Justice Department to investigate the city’s Police Department and force changes. He wrote key provisions of the sweeping police overhaul bill House Democrats passed this summer and heads an influential subcommittee with jurisdiction over eviction law.
And even as he lacerates Bush, Clay has made direct overtures to her allies. He signed onto the Green New Deal, the liberal climate and economic agenda that has been among their most prominent demands. It appears to have worked. Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned for Bush in 2018, has sat on the sidelines this time around.
Bush rejected Clay’s efforts to portray her campaign as racially divisive and accused him of using dirty tactics with “racist undertones” when he sent a mailer including an image of Bush altered to make her skin appear darker.
“No one is targeting CBC members,” Bush said. “What they are targeting is people who are not doing the work of the communities — and communities are suffering.”

When President Donald Trump ran for office four years ago, a conservative writer with a growing following vented the kind of doubt and cynicism that was common among people like her who worried about the damage he could do to their cause. She called him “a demagogue with no real solutions for anything at all.” She accused him of betraying the anti-abortion movement. And she wrote that his constant complaining about being treated unfairly was “ineffectual and impotent.”
Today, that writer, Mollie Hemingway, is one of Trump’s favorites. Her pieces for The Federalist, where she is a senior editor, have earned presidential retweets and affirmation for their scathing criticism of Democrats and the media, whom she accuses of lying about just about everything when it comes to the president. Recently she claimed that journalists had fabricated reports about tear gas and the excessive use of force against protesters outside the White House (law enforcement, in fact, has acknowledged shooting a pepper-based irritant into the crowd) and said “a large group of Democrats” was defending the destruction of federal property (there is no such group).
Hemingway is part of a group of conservative commentators — who have large social media followings, successful podcasts and daily Fox News appearances — that has helped insulate the president and preserve his popularity with his base, even as many Americans say they are likely to vote against him in November.
What these writers and pundits don’t tend to do is make the doggedly pro-Trump defenses that appear on Breitbart and erupt from the mouth of Sean Hannity. Often, they don’t bother at all with the awkward business of trying to explain away Trump’s latest folly.
Instead, they offer an outlet for outrage against those the president has declared his enemies, often by reducing them to a culture war caricature of liberalism.
The capacity that many Trump supporters have developed to focus so intensely on the perceived wrongdoing of his opponents is a powerful asset for the president as he runs for reelection amid growing economic and social turmoil and a public health crisis that a majority of voters say they don’t trust him to handle. This almost entirely white cohort of conservative commentators can spend ample time mocking the mainstream and liberal media for focusing on Trump’s racist and divisive messaging without giving nearly as much consideration to the harm caused, for instance, when he promotes a video of someone shouting “white power.”
Through this lens, Trump’s transgressions seem irrelevant compared with the manifold misdeeds of everyone from the Clintons to CNN. Their portrayal of what the country would look like if the Democrats win big in November is indeed a frightening one to Trump supporters: a White House with Sen. Bernie Sanders as the shadow socialist president; a Democratic House of Representatives where Rep. Ilhan Omar calls the shots; a society in which mask mandates are the first step in a government experiment with social control; a political arena where conservatives are badgered into silence.
To many conservatives these scenarios seem perfectly plausible, especially as some prominent figures on the right contend that their voices are unwelcome in mainstream media — and even some liberals face a backlash for arguing that shaming and ostracism of opposing points of view has grown too common.
“There are a lot of conservatives reading ‘1984’ right now,” said Allie Beth Stuckey, who hosts a podcast, “Relatable,” and is the author of a forthcoming book on self-esteem, “You’re Not Enough (And That’s OK).” Stuckey has a growing fan base and a large platform through her affiliations with right-leaning outfits like Turning Point USA and PragerU that are aimed at reaching millennials. While she does not go out of her way to defend the president, she said she got the sense from her audience that there are a lot of young women like her: socially conservative and religious, who sometimes cringe at Trump’s behavior but don’t let it bother them overall.
“There’s fear. It’s real fear. And I understand if you’re not a conservative it’s hard to be empathetic, and it seems like an exaggeration,” Stuckey said. “But like the same kind of fear on the left that Trump is a unique threat to the country, there’s a real fear on the right, especially I would say from Christians, of what the country would look like under a Democratic president.”
The thread of commentary that isn’t explicitly pro-Trump as much as it is witheringly anti-left has blossomed into a big business, led by personalities like Ben Shapiro, host of one of the most successful podcasts in the country and the author of best-selling books. His most recent is “How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps,” in which he offers a stark take on how for many Americans, the president’s “serious character flaws simply become secondary concerns” when they see the threat from the “rising tide of radicalism from the left.”.
Shapiro isn’t shy about calling out the president for his divisive and unfocused leadership. But far more often he takes shots at Trump’s critics. In this line of attack, Shapiro echoes other conservatives who deflect: Trump wasn’t helping anyone, for instance, by asking top public health officials to study whether disinfectant could be injected into the human body as a coronavirus treatment. But, Shapiro explained he didn’t actually tell people to put bleach in their bodies. “That doesn’t mean he was recommending actually injecting Clorox, people.”
Some media scholars see the desire to pick apart Trump’s critics as a form of entertainment disinformation. “They try to get you not to believe other kinds of information that you might hear in the larger media sphere, and it’s just fun,” said Khadijah White, a professor at Rutgers University who studies race, gender and the media. “It’s really fun to see the other side lose. And that just buttresses the idea that maybe Trump is corrupt, but they’re corrupt, too.”
The anti-liberalism that is flourishing now can be traced back to other moments when the American left was resurgent and conservatives fought back, such as when Richard Nixon helped stoke a backlash of the “silent majority” to the anti-war and counterculture elements of society that many Americans believed had grown too extreme. But historians said this sentiment’s popularity today was a sign of how fragile unity is in a Republican Party led by a president who rejects many of the principles that conservatives have fought for over the last 40 years.
“The conservative ideology that had been cohesive during the Cold War is falling apart,” said Nicole Hemmer, a research scholar at Columbia University. “It seems to me that ‘owning the libs’ is kind of the way you hold everyone together when your policy preferences are coming apart.”
Undoubtedly The Federalist has been one of the biggest breakouts in this genre of commentary, diving headfirst into the culture wars. It debuted in 2013, inspired by what one of its founders, Ben Domenech, described as “a populist respect for the middle class reader outside of New York and Washington, and an abiding love for America.” It leans hard into the culture wars. Its pieces have questioned the #MeToo movement (“One Year in, Me Too Hasn’t Made Me Feel Any Safer Or More Empowered To Speak Out”) and called the effort to recognize transgender identity a “war on women.”
The site’s sweet spot is with stories that feature conservatives battling liberal politicians and journalists in a clash where questions of privilege, gender and race reveal starkly different worldviews, like Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. (Hemingway, who wrote extensively about the Kavanaugh confirmation and co-authored a best-selling book on the hearings, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)
The Federalist is often contrarian, sometimes to excess. Twitter briefly locked the site’s account in March after it shared an article with the headline “How Medical ‘Chickenpox Parties’ Could Turn The Tide Of The Wuhan Virus.” Publicly available web data for June shows that traffic for The Federalist is up 239% year over year, though the website’s internal numbers put the increase higher.
Critics have asked who is funding the site because ad revenue alone wouldn’t be enough to sustain its staff of 14, and political websites often rely on wealthy donors for support. The Federalist has not disclosed its supporters, leading to criticism that it is not being transparent about its agenda. But according to two people with knowledge of its finances, one of its major backers is Dick Uihlein, the Midwestern packing supply magnate and Trump donor who has a history of giving to combative, hard-right candidates, like Roy Moore of Alabama, who make many Republicans squeamish. (After Moore was accused of assaulting underage girls in 2017, The Federalist ran an opinion piece that defended men who dated young women as a practice with a long history that was “not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family.”)
Through a spokesman, Uihlein declined to comment.
Republicans who are no fans of Trump or the turn that their party has taken under him say that its fuming commentariat is a symptom of a deeper problem: its inability to govern. Though the GOP controls half of Washington, its leading voices still often sound like the aggrieved opposition party.
“Ask them what they are building, and they can’t answer,” said Evan McMullin, who ran against Trump in 2016 as a third-party candidate. “They aren’t trying to build anything. They’re just tearing things down.”
This approach may not be enough to help Trump win again. Polls have shown that Democrats feel more intensity about voting than they did four years ago. And unlike in 2016, when exit polls found that voters who said they did not care for either presidential candidate broke overwhelmingly for Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden has an edge with those voters now.
During the 2018 midterm elections, Republican candidates ran ads that portrayed Democrats as socialists who would let drug gangs roam free on suburban streets. These messages largely failed because people didn’t believe them.
Tim Miller, a former adviser to Republican candidates, said one of the problems with the right today is its attempt to make isolated incidents and marginal political figures seem representative of the entire Democratic Party. “What the president says isn’t important,” Miller said, “but what this city alderman running in Chicago says is.”
Republicans and the Trump campaign are pushing those themes again today, focusing on images of unrest from protests in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. But there are signs that this messaging is out of step with the majority of Americans who support the overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrations nationwide against racism that followed the killing of George Floyd.
The subject of the protests — and the unrest in particular — is a frequent topic for Federalist writers like Hemingway. The other day she posted a query to her more than half a million Twitter followers: “I’m looking for videos of ‘peaceful protesters’ from the recent riots,” she wrote.
Trump was pleased. And he retweeted her.

DETROIT — Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a first-term Michigan Democrat who rocketed to national attention as a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is fighting for her political life, locked in a close primary race that could be decided by a few hundred mail-in ballots.
One of the first Muslim women elected to the House of Representatives, Tlaib on Tuesday faces a rematch against Brenda Jones, the Detroit City Council president who Tlaib narrowly defeated in 2018.
It’s a sequel that many more people are likely to be watching. Tlaib’s prominent role in Washington has translated to more resources for her district, supporters say, and in this contest it’s enabled her to significantly outspend her opponent on advertising.
It’s also given Jones an argument against her: that spending time criticizing the president limits the kind of compromises necessary to get the most done for the people who sent her to Washington. And the contest, taking place amid national protests against racial injustice, finds people in this majority-Black district asking themselves whether Black voters must be represented by Black politicians to really be heard.
Tlaib, 43, came to Washington as a member of “the squad,” a group of four progressive women of color elected in 2018 who became frequent targets of Trump, who has attacked them as foreigners who do not love the United States. (All four are American citizens, and only one, Ilhan Omar, was born outside the country.)
For more than 50 years, the district, which includes a portion of Detroit and a handful of surrounding suburbs, was represented by John Conyers, a civil rights icon. Some supporters of Jones, who is Black, have said that she would be a better fit for the district than Tlaib, who is Palestinian by descent.
Ian Conyers, a former state senator and great-nephew of John Conyers who ran against Jones in a special election in 2018 and endorsed her this year, argued that her community ties would help her forge better relationships in Washington.
“From your work in the community, you’re able to directly talk to people who already have a working relationship with you,” he said in his endorsement. “You just can’t make up that experience overnight.”
Tlaib’s supporters, however, reject the idea that she is not an effective advocate for her district.
For Kim McDade, 58, of Highland Park, a Detroit suburb, the information coming from Tlaib’s office on the coronavirus has been invaluable. “She’s had a couple of town halls and she always calls or texts to let us know about those,” said McDade. “It’s been very informative and she also shares the sites where we can get tested.”
Speaking Saturday under a tarp held aloft by a group of supporters to shield her from a sudden downpour, Tlaib tied her criticisms of the president to local concerns about over-policing.
“I’m not going to allow this impeached president to come into my community,” she said to protesters attending a march organized by Detroit Will Breathe, a group started after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police. “He thinks he can send these federal agents and troops into our community on our watch. To think that he’s going to come in and do this to us. No.”
Tlaib caught the attention of Trump the day she was sworn into office in January 2019, when she used an expletive to say she would work to impeach him. She has been the target of the president’s wrath ever since, and her criticism of him won her national attention. But it also prompted Jones to jump into the race earlier this year.
“It’s so important to me that we unify the district. Sixty percent of the district is African American, but it’s not about race, it’s about bringing home the bacon,” Jones said during a recent virtual town hall. “The money we bring home is so important to me, and I’m able to work with those who I don’t always agree with.”
Jones, 60, has good name recognition in the district from her 15 years on the City Council, as well as the five weeks she served in Congress in 2018 after winning the special election, which was held to fill the remainder of Conyers’ term after he retired amid accusations of sexual harassment from former staffers.
In the four-way Democratic primary to complete the rest of Conyers’ term, Jones easily won the portion of the district in Detroit and held her ground in the suburbs, edging out Tlaib by about 1,600 votes, out of about 87,000 cast. But in the six-way Democratic primary for the next full two-year term, which was held concurrently with the special election, Tlaib narrowly won, beating Jones by about 900 votes, out of about 89,000 cast.
Observers expect Tuesday’s primary to be close as well. But Michigan voters may not know the winners of this and many other races on election night because of a surge in absentee voting.
In the 3rd Congressional District, a Republican stronghold in western Michigan that has been trending blue in recent years, five Republicans are vying for the nomination to replace Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican who left the party and briefly considered running for president as a libertarian before deciding to retire.
And in the reliably conservative 10th District, which spans several counties north of Detroit, three Republicans and two Democrats are running to replace Paul Mitchell, who also decided not to run for reelection.
The race between Tlaib and Jones, by far the most prominent, has been characterized by the candidates’ differing campaign styles and disparities in resources.
Tlaib has emphasized in-person appearances, canvassing door to door and attending community events. She has won the endorsement of several labor unions, as well as Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. And she has raised about $3 million, significantly more than Jones, allowing Tlaib to dominate the airwaves in metro Detroit.
“I’ve watched a few of those town halls and some attracted a lot of people, but others didn’t,” said Mario Morrow, a political consultant in Detroit. “One of the people I see most in Southeast Michigan is Rashida Tlaib, and she usually has a bullhorn in her hand. I think she’s on her way back to Washington.”
Jones, who contracted COVID-19 in April and recovered, has limited her campaign to virtual town halls and Zoom calls. She has also been hampered by anemic fundraising — she has raised just $165,000, coming into a campaign that still had debt from the 2018 race.
She has remained competitive thanks in part to the endorsements of the other candidates in the 2018 contest, as well as a large group of influential Black ministers in the city, including the Rev. Wendell Anthony, the president of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP.
“I’ve known Councilwoman Jones as a very solid person who does what she says she’s going to do,” Anthony said. “Following the tenure of Congressman John Conyers, an icon for all of us around here, there’s a legacy that comes with that, and Congresswoman Jones would bring that back and sustain that.”
The race may ultimately come down to whether Jones’ focus on establishment-style retail politics is enough to match Tlaib’s ability to excite voters.
Glenda McDonald, 59, who works at a charter school in Highland Park, said she appreciated Tlaib’s “in-your-face” style, if not always the language that the congresswoman uses.
And while McDonald, who is Black, has taken heat from some friends for supporting Tlaib instead of Jones, she said skin color was not a factor in her choice.
“Most people think that the district’s seat belongs to someone else,” she said. “But I choose who I want to choose. The person who represents me should represent everybody.”

Scrapbooking Isn’t Just for White People [With graphic(s)]

Tazhiana Gordon describes herself as a messy, mixed-media kind of scrapbooker. She uses brightly colored inks and stamps and stickers to layer compositions on paper for personal albums, photos of which she shares with a close-knit online community of fellow crafters.
In early June, in response to the killing of George Floyd by the police and the national protests that followed, she broke from her usual social media posts of scrapbook pages filled with cheerful phrases and family photos. Instead, Gordon, 29, who is a nurse, wrote about joining the crowds in New York and her thoughts about the reckoning with Blackness the country must face.
She lost 30 followers on her Instagram account — a sting that gave her pause. Although some of the loss could be attributed to the normal fluctuations of follower counts, she said, she suspects it was because she had simply said that Black Lives Matter.
“I made people uncomfortable,” Gordon said by phone from her Brooklyn home. “That’s the thing about navigating a white space: You’re OK until you start asserting your Blackness, and then that becomes a problem for some people. I actually had people DM me outright and say, ‘I didn’t follow you for this. I followed you for the scrapbooking.’ And to those folks, I said, ‘Well, go with grace.’”
White Is Not a Default
Certain hobbies conjure a certain stereotype. Scrapbooking is one of those for which it is hard to shed the mental image of a white, middle-aged woman. But as the industry and community that is built around this craft has learned in the last few months, whiteness in scrapbooking is not a given.
Scrapbooking “feels like a radical act of self-care, to write the words of my own life,” said Gordon, who is Black. “No one can take this from me, even if they burn all my albums 20 years from now.”
The anti-racism protests this year have had well-known brands including Nike and Gushers Fruit Snacks scrambling to signal their support for Black consumers. A similar response is coming from small scrapbooking companies and individual designers.
Ali Edwards, a designer and scrapbooking workshop star in Oregon, shared the books she was reading to learn more about racial inequality and invited her followers to join her.
Kelly Purkey, a designer with a shop in Portland, Oregon, shared how she was documenting protests she was attending through the pages of her personal scrapbooks. She also began offering Black Lives Matter-themed stamps, stickers and cards, designed by the artist Salomée, with proceeds going to charity.
But many of the biggest companies in scrapbooking initially remained silent or struggled to respond appropriately.
One of them was Studio Calico, which is beloved for its monthly kits packed with trendier scrapbooking tools, like washi tape patterned with rose gold moons or leopard spots.
When Azzari Jarrett, a photographer and designer in Wilmington, North Carolina, noticed that Studio Calico had been silent about the anti-racism protests, she commented on one of the company’s Instagram posts, asking why there was no message of solidarity for the company’s Black customers, no commitment to work with Black designers or anything else about standing with Black employees. (Jarrett, 41, was featured on the Studio Calico blog in 2018 and said that she has been a customer for seven years.)
Her comment went unaddressed. Then, it was deleted by the Studio Calico account.
“By the next morning, I had so many other women in scrapbooking supporting me and saying, ‘Hey, Studio Calico, you’re silencing your customers. It’s not right,’” Jarrett said. “I did get an apology, but then I responded with, ‘If you do feel this way, then what? What are you going to do to change it? Do you know how many Black employees you have? How many Black designers do you have?’
“They probably don’t even know how many Black customers they have,” she said.
Gordon saw all of this unfold and “called them out, like, immediately,” she said. “If you don’t want to post anything that says Black Lives Matter on your feed or anything about what you’re doing to commit to diversity, that’s your prerogative. But when you start actively silencing Black voices that have been marginalized, that’s where you get called out.”
April Foster, CEO of Studio Calico, said in a statement that “the conversations happening in our communities right now are important and impactful, and we’re listening and learning.”
The company, she said, was reevaluating its processes and products. “We’re intentionally featuring inspiration that lifts up diverse creators, intentionally reaching out to even more diverse designers and creators for our creative team and product designer,” she said.
Jarrett and Gordon said they found support from others in scrapbooking communities, but the disappointment the two women shared felt squarely within the experience of being a Black person in a space deemed “white.”
That reality is reflected in how little scrapbooking ephemera there is on the market that shows Black or brown faces or hands. Purkey, who is Asian American and a 15-year veteran of the industry, said she has worked at some of the biggest companies in scrapbooking and “never worked with a Black co-worker anywhere in any company.”
Jarrett, who is Black, said she began scrapbooking about seven years ago because she wanted to document the birth of her third daughter, and a traditional baby book wasn’t quite her style.
She discovered a style of documenting called pocket scrapbooking and, she said, she “hasn’t looked back.” (Pocket scrapbooking involves using plastic protectors that are divided into segments to showcase cards, photos and ephemera of different sizes.)
Jarrett’s profile in the scrapbooking world began to rise as she posted some of her spreads onto Instagram, where albums, layouts, process videos and tutorials proliferate.
“I just wanted to share a different perspective,” Jarrett said. “You know, someone brown.”
Jarrett became known for her minimalist style, but she said that was partly out of necessity. A page from her scrapbook was recently shared by someone else on Instagram to highlight Black scrapbookers; on that page, she’d used a stamp depicting women’s faces and had colored the faces brown herself.
Seeing her own work again, Jarrett said, made her realize “I didn’t think twice about having to paint a brown face because that’s how I move through the world.”
“I want something that’s reflective of me,” she said. So she recently released her own Black Lives Matter stamps and cards for pocket scrapbooking. One depicts a woman with curly hair; another says, simply, “melanin.”
Scrapbooking design teams for the big crafting companies are often made up of a handful of high-profile customers who, for a period of a few months or a year, receive products before the general public. In exchange, they are typically encouraged to post layouts on social media or on their blogs, if they still have those.
In early July, American Crafts, a Utah company that oversees about a dozen scrapbooking brands, announced its newest design team — about a dozen women, all seemingly white.
Lydia Diaz, a crafter and lifestyle vlogger, called the exclusion “a huge letdown.”
“When it comes to how ignored and how invisible we can feel as Black people in America, and the crafting community is one small slice of the pie, and even there, we’re not represented,” she said on Instagram. “There are so many amazingly talented and creative Black people thinking outside the box, doing big things in this community, and you wouldn’t know it if you were looking at some of these large crafting brands. You wouldn’t see our work, you wouldn’t see our hands on the table holding a craft we just made, you wouldn’t see our faces smiling in one of their online courses, you wouldn’t see us on the ambassador team.”
American Crafts apologized and removed the post, adding that it would soon add more Black women to its team. In late July, Gordon and a longtime scrapbooker named Victoria Calvin were added as well as several other women of color and a man. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Exclusion Is Bad for Business
Throughout generations, all types of people have kept photo albums, commonplace books and scrapbooks, including free Black people and former slaves who documented the Civil War and their postwar lives.
But scrapbooking boomed as an industry in the late 1990s with the help of companies like Creative Memories, in Minnesota, which hosted Tupperware-style parties for scrapbooking all across Midwestern suburbs.
Purkey recalled that she started scrapbooking after attending one of these parties as a kid. “Those parties and the scrapbook stores back then were all in these nice, rich suburbs,” she said. “It was all for these rich suburban women.”
The scrapbooking industry also has ties to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has a well-documented history of relegating Black members to second-class status until the late 1970s.
Mormons, as part of their faith practice, prioritize documenting family history and genealogy. In the 1970s, a Mormon woman named Marielen Christensen from Spanish Fork, Utah, began showcasing the way she preserved photos and written stories at record-keeping conferences. In particular, she pushed the use of binders and more durable materials, like acid-free papers, that would lead to better scrapbook preservation.
In 1981, she opened Keeping Memories Alive, a shop and mail-order catalog dedicated to helping others document their families’ stories, and it became a destination for scrapbookers. Other stores copied the model, and within about 10 years, scrapbooking was a full-on craze.
Through the decades — and the proliferation of digital cameras, then higher-resolution camera phones and social media platforms where scrapbookers began sharing their work — the craft inevitably made it to a broader audience of people who enjoy playing with paper, stickers and stamps.
Today, social media plays a significant role in fueling the idea of who scrapbookers are, but status is signaled by which customers are chosen to be on the rotating company design teams. It’s rare to see a design team with more than one person of color on it.
“There are some days where that’s a lot to carry, being a visible person of color in a community that” doesn’t seem diverse, “like, at all,” Gordon said. “And then there’s some days where it just feels like a badge of honor, because if I can get women who didn’t think that this community was open to them, or if I could just get somebody else to tell their own story, then I feel like I did my job that day.”
Before starting her own company, Purkey had been on a number of design teams. When she broke out on her own, she said she wasn’t specifically thinking about guaranteeing diversity as a cornerstone in building her own teams, but it happened organically.
“I didn’t think about, necessarily — diversity — but I knew I wanted people represented. Like, I knew I had Asian customers. I knew I had, you know, moms of boys,” Purkey said. “It wasn’t specifically about race. It was just, like, making sure that we were kind of showing examples for everybody that shopped in my store.”
After Jarrett (who has been on one of Purkey’s design teams) released her own Black Lives Matter-themed scrapbooking cards and stamps this summer, she said she was surprised when so many people voiced their support.
“So many people reached out to me or in my DMs and on Instagram to say, ‘Hey, thank you for this; scrapbooking is always seen as such a white craft, so it’s good to see other products,’” Jarrett said. “I just — I’m floored. I’m happy to see other women of all races document these stories and that they matter.”
She wasn’t surprised, though, that her Black Lives Matter stamp and “Brown Girl” stamp set have sold out. “There is clearly a market for these types of products,” Jarrett said.

New York’s Sidewalk Prophets Are Heirs to the Artisans of France’s Lascaux Caves [With graphic(s)]

About 17,000 years ago, in the caves of Lascaux, France, ancestors drew on grotto walls, depicting equines, stags, bison, aurochs and felines. They wanted to convey to other humans a political reality crucial to their survival: They shared their environment with other beings that looked and behaved differently from them.
Those early artisans drew these creatures over and over, likely fascinated by their forms and their powers, but also intuiting that whatever happened to the animals would almost certainly be a harbinger of what would happen to humans. The presence of the bison and stags, their physical fitness and numbers, and their mass migrations would have indicated the onset of plagues or cataclysmic weather systems. Containing some 15,000 paintings and engravings from the Upper Paleolithic era, the caves in southwestern France were not simply an exhibition space for local talent. They essentially constituted a public square where a community shared critical knowledge.
These portraits and discrete stories are not very different from our contemporary forums: the street art adorning boarded-up storefronts in New York City. They tell us about our shared political realities, the people we coexist with in social space and the ways in which our stories and fates are tied together. If you walk the streets of SoHo, the alleys of the Lower East Side and heavily trafficked avenues in Brooklyn, as I did over the past few weeks, you will see these symbols and signs and might wonder at their meanings. What became apparent to me is that in the intervening millenniums between those cave paintings and the killing of George Floyd, the messages we share, like the sociopolitical circumstances that impel them, have become more complex.
Now street artists take account of the qualified legal immunity protecting police officers, the Black Lives Matter movement and the ramifications of a dysfunctional democracy, among other realities, using a well-developed visual language of cultural memes that illustrate the ideological battles among regional, racial and cultural factions. When we see the image of thin, green-skinned, bipedal beings with teardrop-shaped black apertures for eyes, we typically read “alien.” But when I see the image of such a creature holding a sign that reads “I can’t breathe,” I grok an urgent message: Even aliens visiting from light years away understand the plight of Black people in the United States because this situation is so obviously dire.
Today’s street paintings contain dispatches that proliferate across the city sphere — lovely, challenging, angry, remonstrative and even desperate. There are two critical things to note about them. They are different from graffiti, which to my eyes is egocentric and monotone, mostly instantiating the will of the tagger over and over again. “I am here and you must see me” is the message.
Street artists point beyond the self to larger, collective issues. The other pressing point is that these images in chalk, paint and oil stick are ephemeral. Between the time I walked these districts and alerted the photographer to document them, five images had already disappeared. One was a depiction of transgender freedom fighter Marsha Johnson, whose image was marked in chalk on the sidewalk in the ad hoc tent city created near Chambers Street a few weeks ago. It’s since been cleared out by police officers.
Unlike the caves of Lascaux (which are on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list) most of the street work won’t be protected or anthologized — but it should be. The lingual messages and coded images on the plywood facades are the means by which future historians and researchers will come to understand this time and give our generation a proper name.
______
In SoHo, artist Nick C. Kirk serialized images of President Donald Trump standing in for overmilitarized police officers in a work constituting a visual indictment of a commander in chief who claims to deploy state forces only to quell violence and enforce the peace. The “VIP” sign on each shield in the piece seems to allude to his widely documented narcissism and suggests that the deployment of the police is a self-serving ploy to burnish his public image. Moreover, the running banner of “Demilitarize the Police” in the piece suggests that, in the artist’s eyes, the police do not come to make peace.
______
On Wooster Street in Manhattan, an unplanned collaboration by Erin Ko, Justin Orvis Steimer, EXR, Antennae and Helixx C. Armageddon reads “Wisdom Lies In / Not Seeing Things But / Seeing Through Things.” This reminds us that it’s incumbent on those of us who want to survive this time to learn to read the signs around us, the messages conveyed by street artists, ad hoc journalists, digital sources and by legacy media. It suggests we need to read these communiqués critically, while not falling into the abyss of conspiracy theories.
______
The green aliens depicted on Canal Street made me both happy and sad. The anonymous artist who made them understood that using aliens to make the point of the simultaneous precariousness and importance of Black lives would be an effective strategy. Seeing aliens advocating the Black Lives Matter campaign cleverly makes the point that even extraterrestrial observers can see our world needs to change.
______
On the other hand, an image of a raised fist by David Hollier at Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn offers a universal message by Frederick Douglass for a reborn America, one not pervaded by racism and greed. It proclaims that “A smile or a tear has no nationality; joy and sorrow speak alike to all nations, and they, above all the confusion of tongues, proclaim the brotherhood of man.” We tend to process and comprehend hardship through the lens of ethnic, gender and national differences. This sign is like a light illuminating a cave most people never enter.

Photographer Simbarashe Cha introduced me to an image, on Crosby Street, by Manuel Pulla, of Ella, a young organizer who holds a large megaphone. This is an apt metaphor for the activist’s voice. She calls for our attention, saying that those who give their commitment to bodily action can transform this country in ways our ancestors could only dream of.

On Union Street in Brooklyn, I found a mural with the characters from the Peanuts comic strip carrying Black Lives Matter signs. It lifted me to see Franklin Armstrong, Charlie Brown and Snoopy joyously and resolutely marching together, as if the movement were the most normative reason to take to the streets. Peanuts, while a cartoon, is also a measure of the degree to which BLM has become an American cause rather than a minority issue.
______
On the Lower East Side, I found a mural by Conor Harrington that both intrigued and flummoxed me. There is a figure that I take to be a man, in Colonial-era clothing (the red coat of what would have, in 1776, been the British faction), twirling a flag that seems to be changing from a blue and white striped field to a red and white scheme — as if the figure’s touch has sparked a revolution. This is perhaps a version of the received, hackneyed idea of the lone hero who can change the course of human history (the 19th-century “great man” theory of leadership promulgated by Thomas Carlyle, among others). Or perhaps it’s an attempt to demonstrate how quickly the flame of revolution can spark a fire that spreads everywhere.
______
Last, there is a bifurcated mural, “Sad Contrast,” on Mercer Street in SoHo that depicts a tearful Statue of Liberty. In the portrait, executed in a colorful expressionistic style, one side of the face is painted by Calicho Arevalo and the other by Jeff Rose King. King’s side suggests an Indigenous woman in a headdress, composed to mirror the crowned Roman goddess. Both figures look steadily at the viewer, essentially asking: How will you see us, and what will we mean to you?

On May 29, four days after George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police, Theresa Ruth Howard posted a call to action on Instagram:
“Demonstrate your outrage
Demonstrate your allyship
Demonstrate your authenticity
We don’t need shadow heroes, step into the light ...”
Howard, a former ballet dancer who founded the digital platform Memoirs of Blacks in Ballet (or MoBBallet), was addressing the institutions she has worked with for the past few years, in a role she sums up as “diversity strategist and consultant.” Those institutions, which include some of the world’s most prestigious ballet companies and schools, are predominantly white, onstage and behind the scenes. They know they need to evolve, and she is helping them.
So when protests against systemic racism and police brutality began sweeping the country, she found their silence disconcerting. “You can’t say you want us, and when we are in peril, not be there for us,” Howard, 49, said in an interview.
Over the next few days, companies answered her call, or tried, posting statements of support with a hashtag she had started: #balletrelevesforblacklives. (Relevé, a ballet term, is a way of saying “rise up.”) Their messages drew both appreciation and criticism, with many commenters demanding action, not merely words. In an opinion piece for Dance Magazine, Howard expanded on her thoughts about what leadership should look like in this moment, under the headline “Where Is Your Outrage? Where Is Your Support?”
On Aug. 14, leaders from more than a dozen ballet companies and schools will convene for an online discussion titled “#balletrelevesforblacklives ... Or Does It?,” a chance to reflect, beyond social media, on the Black Lives Matter movement and its impact on their institutions. The public event is part of Howard’s second annual MoBBallet symposium, a series of conversations and lectures that, in her words, “centers Blackness but welcomes all.”
The multiweekend symposium will explore topics like colorism in ballet and implicit bias in teaching dance history and hold a session for dancers on “how to activate your activism.” These issues have long been pressing to Howard, even as others are just beginning to feel their urgency. A former member of Dance Theater of Harlem — the company founded 51 years ago, by visionary Arthur Mitchell, as a space for African American dancers in classical ballet — she established MoBBallet in 2015 to highlight the often overlooked histories of Black ballet artists.
Virginia Johnson, Dance Theater’s artistic director, says that Howard has been “a force of change” for years: “She’s done her research, she knows her methods, and she is relentless in not letting people off the hook. And that’s what’s needed.”
“Now that people are ready,” Johnson added, “she is flying, and they can join her.”
As a writer, public speaker and social media presence, Howard is one of the most vocal proponents for racial equity in ballet. But she’s not alone in shaping a more inclusive field. In addition to her independent work as a diversity strategist, she was part of a team of consultants for the Equity Project, a three-year initiative led by Dance Theater of Harlem, Dance/USA and the International Association of Blacks in Dance. The project, which involved directors from 21 North American ballet organizations, ended in June.
While some ballet schools, over the years, have developed internal diversity initiatives, the Equity Project had more holistic aims. Johnson described it as “focused on bringing African Americans to the field of ballet in all aspects — onstage and behind the stage, in the wings, in the administrative offices, in the schools.” It sought to ensure “that these organizations are not bastions of whiteness,” she said. “Or if they are, they’ve decided that is what they want, and they are not just ignorantly moving forward.”
Through the Equity Project, Howard met some of the people with whom she now works closely, like Barry Hughson, the executive director of the National Ballet of Canada in Toronto. Like many of her colleagues, he appreciates Howard’s directness.
“I need someone to be brutally honest with me, and to do that in a way that inspires us all to keep pushing forward,” he said. “That’s her spirit.”
Their conversations, he added, have helped him to think more deeply about equity in all dimensions of the National Ballet, not just in hiring dancers.
“For a while we were focused on representation, on the company looking more racially diverse, and it does look more racially diverse,” he said. “But now it’s like turning inward and saying: What do these artists need to feel support and safety, and to see themselves on a path through and up the ranks? That’s the work at hand, and that’s where Theresa’s been standing by our side as we imagine the future.”
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the future can be hard to imagine. Ellen Walker, the executive director of Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, said that despite the challenges facing the company, there is also opportunity in this break from business as usual.
“I talk to Theresa a lot about this: Who do we want to be on the other side?” she said. “So that we are not in an academic or theoretical or workshop-y place with our work around diversification of our company and school and institution, but that we are absolutely making real change, and the action steps we’ve taken are showing up.”
Howard would probably be pleased to hear this. As a diversity strategist, she strives to bring directors “from their head space, which is that organizational lens, into their heart space, that more empathetic human lens,” she said. She wants them to understand, as much as possible, how it feels to be Black in ballet’s white spaces, “the added pressure the brown body takes on.”
For a Black ballet dancer, “It’s not just an arabesque, it’s not just a pirouette,” she said. “You’re the Black girl doing the arabesque, you’re the Black girl doing the pirouette. Which says that either Black people can do this, and they’re capable, or they’re not. That’s something white dancers, white students, don’t carry with them.”
Howard speaks from firsthand experience. Growing up in Philadelphia, she was one of few students of color at the School of Pennsylvania Ballet. She remembers feeling entirely welcome there until the year she was cast in “The Nutcracker” in a coveted party-scene role — or so she thought. She’d seen her name on the cast list next to the “Bootmaker’s Daughter,” but when the time came for children to pick up their costumes, hers went instead to a white girl, someone who looked more like the rest of the fictional family onstage.
She recalls breaking into tears as she told her father what had happened. (“I had a dance father, who did the driving, sewed the point shoes,” she said.) He spoke with the company’s artistic director, and she ended up splitting the role with the white student.
“I don’t know if that changed me,” she said, “but it might have solidified my desire to dance with Dance Theater of Harlem.” (She had seen the company perform a few years before, when she was 8.) “In my mind, that would never happen in a place like that.”
After performing with Dance Theater from 1989 to ’92, Howard danced with choreographers including Karole Armitage and Donald Byrd. Byrd, now her close friend, said that about five years ago, he noticed that she “was in a real funk.” Around that time, the idea for MoBBallet came to her, springing from a blog post she had written on Misty Copeland, the American Ballet Theatre star, and lesser-known Black ballerinas who came before her.
Suddenly, Howard was reinvigorated, Byrd said. “It seemed like she felt that she was definitely on the right track, that she had discovered the thing that she could do, and that she needed to do, and it just kind of took over.”
While Howard said that lately she feels like a “very former” dancer, her ballet roots deeply inform her work, even something as simple as the way she walks into a room. In 2017, she gave a rousing and eye-opening keynote address at Positioning Ballet, a convening of 40 international company directors in Amsterdam.
“The moment she enters a stage, you can see and feel that she understands ballet,” said Peggy Olislaegers, an artistic consultant for Dutch National Ballet, which hosted the conference. “She has this embodied knowledge. She loves ballet, and that gives her a clear authority within the field of ballet directors.”
These days Howard is as much a resource for ballet dancers — a mentor and an advocate — as she is for company directors, although she stresses that she is “still learning and evolving” in her work. Sebastian Villarini-Velez, a New York City Ballet soloist, said that when he recently met with Howard, seeking her guidance about organizing a group of dancers of color at City Ballet, he was struck by how attentively she listened.
“I know it sounds cliché,” he said, “but I felt heard, for one of the first times.”
Chyrstyn Fentroy, a Boston Ballet soloist, has enjoyed popping into Howard’s Instagram Live sessions, which invite candid discussion among dancers. Ballet, Fentroy said, tends to train dancers not to speak up. “You take the correction, and it doesn’t matter if it hurts your feelings, you just nod your head and keep dancing.” But Howard is helping to change that: “I think she’s allowing people to learn where their voices are.”

Some Wedding Vendors Face Fallout After Speaking Up on Social Issues [With graphic(s)]

In June, photographer Shakira Rochelle started taking photographs of Black Lives Matter protesters in her hometown of Cincinnati. She shared the images and other supportive BLM content on her personal Instagram account. Shortly, thereafter she received a text from a couple who had hired her to photograph their wedding.
In a screenshot of the text that has since gone viral, the couple said they wanted to cancel their contract because they didn’t feel Rochelle was a fit if she supported the Black Lives Matter movement.
Rochelle isn’t the only wedding professional who has seen fallout from voicing opinions in tweets and posts online. The New York-based photographer Clane Gessel also lost a client when he posted an Instagram story while at a Black Lives Matter protest. First the clients unfollowed his social media account. Then they called to say that they didn’t feel “comfortable” with Gessel at the wedding and didn’t want their wedding photos next to posts that “don’t support the guests’ views.”
Gessel wasn’t bothered by the cancellation. “Silence is the enemy here, and the only reason we see change is when people speak and act out,” he said. “We should speak up regardless of the monetary penalties involved to do what’s right.”
Several social and political issues have converged in recent months. Among them: a global pandemic and debates over wearing masks; June’s annual Pride celebration and support for transgender lives; the uprising of Black Lives Matter protests and discussions on race and the criminal justice system. Not surprisingly, social media has become a hot spot for these conversations, even among wedding professionals.
Many vendors say that this is the first time they have publicly expressed their personal opinions in their professional space. Some have lost followers, clients and money; others expect to. And so the question remains: How much should wedding professionals share about their political and personal beliefs?
“When something affects your community at its core, it’s nearly impossible to continue as if nothing is happening,” said Sheena Meekins, an owner and photographer at Anée Atelier in New York.
She and her business partner, Gina Esposito, explained that they are used to capturing emotional, authentic and intimate moments, and so it seemed only natural for them to speak out on something equally emotional: human rights.
Meekins said they have not lost clients nor been affected negatively in any way after speaking out.
Deciding to take a public stance is not done lightly. Joe Bunn, a DJ based in Raleigh, North Carolina, shared a heartfelt post about his beliefs in early June. In it, he wrote that he had never posted about his politics, but felt he had to say something a few days after the killing of George Floyd. “I can’t explain it,” Bunn said of the emotional draw to post. “I think equality is everything.”
He has also posted about wearing masks for public health. Whether that is the right decision, businesswise, he doesn’t know, but it is right personally. “Silence isn’t the move in 2020,” he added.
Troy Williams, who runs Simply Troy, an event planning company in Los Angeles, felt posting went beyond his business; it’s personal. He has an adopted Black son, who is 7, and a same-sex partner; he says both are big motivators for stepping up and speaking out to his 22,000 Instagram followers. Though he knows that not all of his clients may agree, he wants to use his platform to “stand up for what’s right” and his own family’s future.
Couples are taking notice, too. Madeline Johnson, a 28-year-old publicist, said that she felt immense pride when her Florida-based photographer, Chloé Brennan of Chloé Bee Photography, who was hired for her Seaside, Florida, nuptials, started posting support for Black Lives Matter on Instagram. Not only did Johnson and her fiancé, Arjun Rao, 33, the director of software engineering for a marketing firm, agree with Brennan, but they respected that she was doing so in a more conservative place than New York, where the couple lives.
For some, like Jove Meyer, an event planner and designer based in Brooklyn, and Erica Taylor Haskins, a founder of Tinsel Experiential Design, also in Brooklyn, politics and personal views have always been a part of their brands. Meyer is a fierce advocate for the LGBTQ community and same-sex weddings, even educating colleagues in the industry on how to be more inclusive. Haskins said that personal beliefs have been integral to the Tinsel brand as well, since she and her two co-founders began 11 years ago.
One of their first professional Instagram posts was in support of same-sex marriage during California’s Proposition 8 debate. Since then, the two have found subtle ways to share their beliefs, including posts about political fundraisers they do for candidates they support. Both posted heavily during Pride month.
Marcy Blum, an event planner and designer based in New York, puts it right out there. Her Instagram and Twitter bios include the phrase “an unapologetic lover of parties and fiercely against Donald Trump.” She said she has always been politically minded, since her days protesting the Vietnam War in the 1960s. This doesn’t stop her from working with someone of an opposing belief, but she wants her clients — and fellow wedding professionals — to know where she stands.
Not all agree that social media is a place for conversation on social and political topics. It was a challenge, though, to find wedding professionals who don’t agree to speak on the record. Those vendors who chose not to post a black square on Blackout Tuesday, after Floyd’s death, quickly received flak from colleagues for the apparent lack of support for Black Lives Matter. Then, there are others who are singled out for virtue signaling.
“I do suspect some posted the black square in response to peer pressure or just as a token of solidarity,” said Vikram Panicker, the principal creative designer at Elegant Affairs, an event design and décor company based in Fairfield, New Jersey.
Panicker has continued to discuss same-sex marriage, the government’s handling of the pandemic, Black Lives Matter, and more on his Instagram stories, but others in the industry have quickly returned to sharing images of past events and wedding-only content. “It doesn’t sit well with me to just keep posting pretty pictures in a time like this,” he said.
His last post on his main feed on Instagram is a black square. Panicker said several colleagues reached out to applaud his efforts, but several others also stopped following him.
Kaleigh Wiese, a wedding industry brand strategist and the owner of the Austin, Texas, stationery company Meldeen, said professionals she has spoken with recently feel like they will get shamed if they post and shamed if they don’t post; it’s a lose-lose situation. She, however, guides her clients to understand that saying nothing online isn’t a great look.
“Life happens offline, but your brand is what other people say it is,” Wiese said. “A lot of that is online. Having an online presence is a social responsibility. You simply cannot have a business today without showcasing diversity and inclusivity.”
Increasingly, couples seem to want their wedding professionals’ values to align with their own. Sabrina McMillin, 26, the account director at a communications firm in Brooklyn, said that from the start, she and her fiancé, Brian Carpan, 28, a student at Kingsborough Community College, have sought progressive wedding businesses owned by women, people of color and the LGBTQ community for their celebration, which was originally scheduled for September and rescheduled for July 2021. Most, if not all, of her vendors have made social media statements regarding current issues, she added.
Would she change her mind about a vendor, even at an expense, if she found them posting something derogatory?
“Yes,” she said, “there have to be consequences for this type of behavior that marginalizes people.” McMillan added that they have removed guests from their list who have expressed racist sentiments in response to recent protests, too.
For Natalie Hamlin, 30, a publicist in Los Angeles, the past few months have inspired her and Christopher Foulston, 35, a game developer, to rethink their vendors, especially since their wedding has been postponed because of the coronavirus. She said they not only pivoted to vendors who are taking serious safety precautions regarding the virus, but also did research into those who have raised awareness of systemic racism and discrimination. They would regret hiring a vendor that discriminates against employees or patrons because of their culture, race, or sexual orientation. They have married friends, she noted, who already regret their vendor choices in the past after seeing recent posts by them on social media.
“The investment is not only monetary,” Hamlin said. “We want to be surrounded by professionals who believe that love and empathy comes in all forms.”

Rave Under the Kosciuszko Bridge: Are Illicit Parties Endangering NYC? [With graphic(s)]

NEW YORK — On a humid Saturday night, under a segment of the Kosciuszko Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Queens, hundreds of people at an illicit gathering danced and swayed to the thumps of electronic music. Some wore masks. Many did not.
Many were attending their first party in months, since the pandemic had forced many venues to close.
“People were just enjoying themselves,” said one of the attendees, Jimmy Escobar, 30, of Brooklyn. “People got locked up for so long, and they finally got to go out.”
New Yorkers, by and large, have adhered to rules mandating social distancing and mask wearing. The diligence has helped keep the coronavirus under control in the city even as outbreaks have raged across the country, primarily in the South and the West.
As the summer wears on, however, mounting reports of parties, concerts and other social events, like the rave attended by Escobar, are raising fears that New York’s hard-earned stability may be tenuous.
Over the last few weeks, videos and photos posted on social media — at bars, at beaches, at warehouses, at pools, at hotels — show densely packed, mask-free crowds, similar to the Memorial Day weekend gatherings at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri and in states like California and Florida that are now reeling from virus outbreaks.
The images contrast sharply with the memories of a brutal spring in New York that left tens of thousands dead, disproportionately ravaging low-income communities and neighborhoods with high numbers of Black and Latino people.
“It’s disrespectful,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a recent news conference about the partying. “It’s illegal. It not only violates public health, but it violates human decency.”
Many of the images show how a segment of the nightlife industry, a crucial piece of New York City’s culture, is desperately trying to revive itself after having been shut down when the pandemic hit.
But other events, which charge for tickets, drinks or other amenities, perhaps illustrate how some people are looking to capitalize on the public’s restlessness.
Osvaldo Chance Jimenez, 44, who has helped organize underground parties in New York City in the past, said the growing number of events risked seeding future outbreaks, which would likely disproportionately affect communities of color, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens where many of the gatherings are taking place.
Jimenez has used his Instagram account, @hilovenewyork, to draw attention to what he sees as reckless behavior. He pointed to yacht parties where organizers are selling tickets for up to $100, and a requirement at a day club at the Ravel Hotel in Long Island City, Queens, that guests pay between $35 and $50 to take a rapid coronavirus test on site, as examples of what he called “vulture capitalism.”
“It is the arrogance of money,” he said. “These people do not care.”
Lauren Flax, a DJ, producer and artist based in Brooklyn, said people should not be partying yet. Flax has lost work and is living off unemployment checks and other government assistance. But she said that even thinking about holding a dance party would be irresponsible before there was a better understanding of the virus and better testing technology.
“I don’t think any of us should be thinking about our career right now,” she said.
Asked this week about the rave under the Kosciuszko Bridge, and an illegal boat party with more than 170 guests that was held over the weekend, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the authorities had moved quickly to address a few cases of wrongdoing and that most people were following the rules.
“But where we see something wrong, we got to go in and stop it immediately,” the mayor said.
The New York City Sheriff’s Office, one of the city agencies tasked with enforcing the social distancing rules during the pandemic, has responded to several reports of illegal parties since the pandemic began, including the boat party, Sheriff Joseph Fucito said.
He said the office was trying to take a more proactive approach to stop the parties before they take place.
Dr. Jay Varma, de Blasio’s senior adviser for public health, said the city had not “seen any large clusters specifically associated with any of these events.” But about 15% of people who test positive in the city, and are interviewed by contact tracers, reported being at some sort of gathering outside of their home, city officials said.
City data indicates that while the parties and other gatherings are on the rise, the outbreak does not appear to be worsening. The number of new hospitalizations in a day has not reached 50 in weeks — in March and April, it was routinely higher than 1,000 per day, according to city data.
An uptick in cases also did not materialize after thousands of protesters, many of them wearing masks, gathered for weeks during Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the city.
But the fear, Jimenez and others say, is that younger people who get infected while attending a party, and who may be less likely to be severely affected by the virus, will spread it to more vulnerable people.
“Things are only going to get worse,” he said. “I feel for my city. I pray that I’m wrong.”
Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said the parties should not come as a surprise.
“People will socialize in nightlife spaces, whether you like it or not,” Rigie said. “You could have unsafe, unregulated nightlife. Or you can do everything you can to have safe, regulated nightlife. But we can’t act as if it’s not going to exist.”
Rigie said that local, state and federal governments should be providing financial assistance, like rent support, to these businesses and others affected by the nightlife shutdown, and that there should be better guidance and research on how to operate safely.
Some businesses, like the Ravel Hotel, have tried to figure that out themselves, with mixed results. The hotel’s day club, Profundo, which has an outdoor rooftop pool, reopened in late June at 50% capacity and required guests to be tested for the virus on site.
The rapid tests used by the hotel were made by Abbott Laboratories, according to Gothamist. The tests, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, were designed to provide results within minutes.
But the FDA had said in May that the tests might be delivering false negative results, raising questions about safety at Profundo.
Then, on July 4, videos and photos posted on social media showed several poolside guests at the hotel not wearing masks, and standing and dancing close together. In a statement, the hotel acknowledged that those guests were “not following directions” but said that it had “retrained security and staff on how to handle these situations moving forward” with the help of the city.
An FDA spokeswoman said this week that the agency had since worked with Abbott to improve the test. A spokeswoman for the hotel said this week that the tests were no longer being administered but would not answer questions about why.
Seth Levine, an owner of the Ravel Hotel, said in a separate statement that the site also provides guests with hand sanitizer, masks and printed rules about social distancing. A security team makes sure guests wear masks when moving around the property, he said.
Some guests said they believed that the tests and other measures had adequately lowered the risk of infection or transmission. Joey Sutera, who works in marketing, said he went to the rooftop pool on July 4 with 30 friends.
A DJ performed at Profundo on Monday, and the venue was beckoning guests to gather there this weekend. One of its posts on Instagram offered a free bottle of rosé to some guests who missed celebrating their birthday because of the pandemic. A poolside table was listed at $500 on the hotel’s website.
Escobar, who attended the party under the bridge, said he was not worried about contracting or transmitting the virus. He did not have symptoms, he said, and a sign at the party told people to wear a face covering.
“If people want to go out and enjoy themselves, regardless of risk, let them do it,” he said.
But Kristina Alaniesse, 36, who has worked as an event promoter and now posts images on Instagram of reckless behavior at parties, said the danger was not only for the partygoers but for the people they interact with later.
“It’s not a time to celebrate,” she said. “We’re not out of the woods.”

NEW YORK — Derrick Ingram, an organizer of a group leading New York’s Black Lives Matter protests, was besieged inside his Manhattan apartment Friday while a police helicopter patrolled overhead, officers banged on his door and police dogs waited in the hallway.
The street outside had been closed off by roughly two dozen police vehicles and dozens of officers, including some who were wearing riot gear. At the end of the block, Black Lives Matter supporters had gathered with bullhorns and cameras to protest what appeared to be Ingram’s imminent arrest.
“What did I do? What did I do?” he said on a livestream posted on Instagram. “I was born Black, that’s what I did.”
The tense standoff in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood continued for several hours as Ingram, 28, talked to lawyers via Zoom and communicated with the outside world over the Instagram video.
He declined to let the officers enter his apartment without a warrant. A police spokeswoman, Sgt. Jessica McRorie, said later that the officers were there to arrest him on charges that he had assaulted an officer.
In the end, the police left shortly after 1 p.m. without arresting him. But the tremendous show of force renewed questions about how the Police Department is addressing the protests for racial justice that have continued in New York for weeks and how they are dealing with those who participate in them.
The episode came about 10 days after the arrest of a transgender woman, Nikki Stone, 18, who was taken away from a protest in an unmarked van in a move that drew criticism from Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
In that instance, de Blasio suggested the arrest had been justified, but he criticized its execution, saying police leaders should have handled it differently given continuing tensions over the department’s practices.
Ingram is a founder of Warriors in the Garden, a group that has led many marches and rallies around the city since forming in June. The police spokeswoman did not offer details about the assault he is alleged to have been involved in and she said the investigation was continuing.
With hundreds of people watching the scene unfold on Warriors in the Garden’s Instagram account, Ingram sat in the living room of his West 45th Street apartment while a police officer pounded on his door and told him to come out.
At one point, the officer could be hearing saying the police were treating Ingram “like a gentleman.”
“Why do you think ‘hostage negotiation’ is here right now?” Ingram said to those who were watching the video. “They have dogs. I can hear the dogs in the hallway. They’re texting me right now.”
Addressing the audience, he said he was afraid that the officers would hurt him if he went outside or would plant something incriminating in his home if he let them in.
The video was interrupted at another point. When it resumed, he said he believed the officers were interfering with his cellphone calls so that every time he got one, a “detective” was intercepting it. The claim could not be verified.
In a statement issued later, Ingram said the officers who came to his home had not produced a warrant and had “used threats and intimidation tactics.”
“This was an attempt to silence our movement,” he said. “This militarized police response endangers the safety of residents in Hell’s Kitchen and across” New York City.
In a subsequent Instagram post, Warriors in the Garden said Ingram would turn himself in to police early Saturday and that the group was planning a protest march the same day.
Warriors in the Garden formed in New York amid the demonstrations that began after the killing in police custody of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Several of its leaders — most of whom are Black and in their 20s — live in Hell’s Kitchen and elsewhere in midtown Manhattan.
One of the group’s leaders, Joseph Martinez, 20, said in June that the name was a reminder “to tend this vision we have while fighting in this climate of violence and brutality.”
The group’s Instagram following has swelled to more than 30,000 users over the course of the summer as it attracted the attention of so-called influencers. Several of its members have been arrested during the recent protests.
Before he began organizing protests, Ingram used his own Instagram account mostly to talk about his Haitian heritage and his diet and fitness regimen. He has participated in protests despite having lupus, an autoimmune disease that he said put him at a higher risk of complications were he to contract the coronavirus.
“We are fighting two pandemics,” Ingram told a reporter in June, referring to the virus and racism.
During the livestream Friday, he said he had never assaulted or threatened anyone. He said he feared that he was being targeted for having filed complaints with the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates allegations of police misconduct, after clashes with pro-police protesters in Bayside, Queens, in July.
The group’s message — shouted on the street outside Ingram’s apartment Friday — has been “peaceful protest.” Its goal, leaders said in June, is to change the criminal justice system.
One of Ingram’s supporters who came to Hell’s Kitchen on Friday, a 22-year-old woman named Bobbii, who declined to give her last name, said that some protesters occasionally teased him and others in his group for their reputations as peaceful organizers.
“Warriors in the Garden — other people in Black Lives Matter make fun of them sometimes because their whole thing is don’t ever engage with the police,” she said. “They’re always so careful.”

Black at the University of Texas and Beyond [With graphic(s)]

Last summer, before the start of his senior year at the University of Texas at Austin, Adraint Bereal set out to chronicle the lives and experiences of Black students at his predominantly white college. (Black students comprised 4.9%, or roughly 2,500 of UT Austin’s 51,832 students, in the fall of 2019.)
His photo project, The Black Yearbook, was meant to be complete before graduation, but the second semester presented several unexpected variables. First, a pandemic disrupted higher education and took a disproportionate toll on Black communities.
“The pandemic forced me to sit with the work longer,” Bereal, 22, said.
Then there was the killing of George Floyd, which brought protests to Austin and many other cities around the world. All of a sudden, his project, which explores the persistence of anti-Black racism but also showcases Black joy and resilience, felt urgent.
“I think all those things go hand in hand with the bigger picture of just not being seen as this monolithic identity or entity and wanting to not be ‘othered’ all the time,” he said. “And I think that’s something that really pushed me to keep going through it all.”
Here, three of his classmates talk about being Black at UT Austin, how college helped shape their identities, and the year none of them saw coming. These conversations have been edited.
Rebecca Petty
Rebecca Petty, 22, is from Sherman, Texas. She majored in fashion merchandising and consumer sciences.
Because I grew up in a predominantly white town, going to UT was a moment where I met and interacted with a lot more Black people my age for the first time. And it was really something that I really appreciated.
I feel that I am no one’s immediate thought when they think of what a quote-unquote Black person at UT’s experience is. But you can’t pigeonhole a Black person or a Black woman to be something that you think they are. We are a wide range of people who can do all types of things and break all types of barriers in all types of situations.
I was the first Black president of a predominantly white sorority on our campus. I think it gave the girls who look like me and are coming into college the idea that they could do this, too. It’s an opportunity to give other women the courage and the foresight to take up positions like that in sororities that we weren’t always welcomed in.
In high school people would say, “You’re actually white. You’re an Oreo.” Black and white people were saying that to me. They would think it was so funny. And I was like, “I’m a Black woman, and there’s no changing that. Maybe you don’t think I’m Black because I don’t act like the stereotype of what you think I should act like. But I most definitely am.”
It’s always something that bothered me, but I just never talked about it.
I remember I saw a post about a woman talking about that on Instagram and it resonated with me, but I was so scared to post about it. And then I was like, this is a perfect time to explain to people how I feel when they say those things to me, because they probably don’t realize it.
So I did, and a girl I went to high school was like, “I’m so sorry. I know I did that to you, and I never thought about how that would affect you.” That was amazing, seeing how people really wanted to listen in that moment and just sharing my story about who I am and what being a Black woman in America has meant to me for the last 22 years, how I think it can be better and what I love about it as well.
Jordan Walters
Jordan Walters, 21, is a history and African and African diaspora double major from Paris, Texas, who is one course away from graduating.
There’s a bit of kind of relief because school will be there in the fall, but once that’s over I just don’t know what exactly that would mean for me. I come from a very small town, and so it’s not like I can just go home and find this spectacular opportunity. It’s a very Southern, East Texas, racist, homophobic environment, so I don’t necessarily want to go home for that long just for my own well-being and safety.
I’m Black, queer, nonbinary and femme. I don’t know when my last day on this Earth will be. So I really want to live every day to the best of my capacity, to do what I want to do, to do what love, to be happy.
These past few months have just been really, really illuminating and given me a better view of what I want out of life.
A really life-changing moment happened when I participated in some protests in Austin, the first weekend a lot of the major protests were happening around the country.
That weekend, while trying to assist someone that was injured and in need of medical care, I was shot at by the police. Thankfully it wasn’t with real bullets, but it was still less lethal bullets that created significant amounts of damage for some of the people around me.
At that point, I think I had made the choice — though I shouldn’t have had to make the choice — that I was willing to give my life if it meant that more people like me would have a better life experience. That’s also when it like really cemented in my mind that the rest of my life will be dedicated to doing things for people like me and forcing my way into these different spaces and really agitating the norm everywhere I go.
Xavier McNeil
Xavier McNeil, 23, is from Huntsville, Texas, and majored in public relations.
I’m from a little small town outside of Houston. There are literally more students who go to UT than in my hometown.
My parents went to college, but they didn’t finish, so they really don’t know a lot about college life and fraternities and sororities. So when I got to UT, I really had no idea what they were about.
Fraternity life was very comforting, because it was just a whole bunch of people who look like me, with somewhat of the same type of upbringing as me, the same values, and I was able to express my experiences to everybody else.
Since UT is a predominantly white institution, it’s easy to get lost, feel lonely, or feeling like you’re not around your type of people, because we do go to these classes with like 400-plus students, and there are probably like two or three Black people in one class.
I’m my mom’s only child, so me and her are close and she’s always talking to me about just being careful and staying in my house. Especially with the stuff about Ahmaud Arbery, she was like, “Don’t go for a jog.” And I like to jog a lot. She was like, “Just try to work out in your own place for the meantime and just be careful.”
Applying for jobs and interviewing on a daily basis, you get those people that feel like they have to say something to you to either make themselves feel better or try to make you feel better. I’ve really been feeling like people may be trying to fill a diversity quota or trying to make it seem like their company has a more diverse outlook because of the movement, to seem like, “OK, we’re this company. We accept your kind.”
I was interviewing for a PR company in Austin. The dude answered the Zoom call, and he was like, “Hey, brother, you don’t have to dress up. You could have just chilled in your T-shirt.” And I just said, “Oh. My bad. I just wanted to dress up for the interview.” He was like, “Nah, it’s cool, my brother.” I was just wondering why he kept saying “my brother.”
Then we did the interview and he kept saying, “We need some younger, hip people around” and stuff like that. And I was just thinking, “Bro, I don’t know … just say you need some Black folk or keep it pushing.” People are trying to code-switch to something they’re not. It’s trash and it’s funny at the same time.

Boycotted. Criticized. But Fox News Leads the Pack in Prime Time. [With graphic(s)]

In one sense, this has been a difficult period for Fox News: a star anchor fired after being accused of sexual harassment, a lawsuit depicting a misogynist workplace, a top writer exposed as a racist internet troll, advertiser boycotts and outrage after Tucker Carlson called protesters “criminal mobs” and questioned the patriotism of a senator who lost her legs in Iraq.
In another sense, business has never been better.
In June and July, Fox News was the highest-rated television channel in the prime-time hours of 8 to 11 p.m. Not just on cable. Not just among news networks. All of television. The average live Fox News viewership in those hours outstripped cable rivals like CNN, MSNBC and ESPN as well as broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC, according to Nielsen.
That three-hour slot is a narrow but significant slice of TV real estate, and it is exceedingly rare for a basic cable channel to outrank the Big Three broadcasters, which are available in more households and offer a wider variety of programming.
Even the return of live sports did little to stop the momentum: The Fox News programs hosted by Carlson and Sean Hannity drew more live viewers than competing baseball and basketball games, including a New York Yankees and Washington Nationals matchup on opening day.
Fox News’ big summer has been boosted by a rise in audience for news programming in general, an increase driven by interest in the pandemic, civil rights protests and the presidential election. ABC, CBS and NBC, meanwhile, have more reruns on the summer schedule; the coronavirus has suspended most TV productions; and viewers are being lured away by streaming services and on-demand Hollywood movies.
But the Fox News ratings also demonstrate the size and resilience of America’s audience for pro-Donald Trump opinion and the loyalty of Fox News viewers who shrug off the controversies that routinely swirl around the network.
“Massive news events that conservatives view through a highly partisan lens are driving the ratings, and none of the controversies really land with loyal Fox News viewers,” said Nicole Hemmer, a scholar at Columbia University and a historian of U.S. conservative media.
Lachlan Murdoch, executive chair of Fox News’ parent company, bragged on an earnings call last week about the network’s “astronomical” ratings. He also said its ad revenue was up from a year ago — a reminder that Fox News, for all the flak it takes from critics, politicians and the advertisers that fled Carlson, remains an unrivaled profit engine for the Murdoch empire.
Complaints that Fox News prime-time hosts downplayed the coronavirus — and, in the case of Laura Ingraham, encouraged the use of hydroxychloroquine, a drug shown to be useless and even dangerous for COVID-19 patients — made little difference.
“The belief that hydroxychloroquine is something between a therapeutic and a miracle cure is wildly popular in conservative media, especially talk radio,” Hemmer said. “Tucker Carlson’s controversies have never really hurt his ratings, though they have cost him advertisers.”
Two days stood out when Fox News ratings fell significantly: the funerals of George Floyd, the Minnesota man who died after a police officer pinned him to the ground during a routine stop, and Rep. John Lewis, the towering civil rights figure.
Like its rivals CNN and MSNBC, Fox News carried the memorial services live. During Floyd’s funeral, viewership on all three networks dipped. On both occasions, the drop in Fox News’ audience was stark, down to numbers more typically seen during overnight hours. (CNN and Mediaite previously reported on the ratings dips.)
Overall, viewers have shown a strong appetite for news on politics, public health and natural disasters.
The evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC are notching their biggest audiences in years. David Muir’s “World News Tonight” on ABC has been a standout: In July, its episodes were the top 18 telecasts across all of broadcast and cable television, drawing more viewers than usual summertime ratings leaders like NBC’s “America’s Got Talent.”
All three of the network newscasts, which air at 6:30 p.m., draw more viewers than Fox News’ prime-time shows, with Muir more than doubling Hannity’s average in July.
Cable channels define prime time as 8 to 11 p.m., but the Big Three broadcasters include the 7 p.m. Sunday slot in their average prime-time audience counts. That is when “60 Minutes” airs on CBS — another news show that is hugely popular with viewers — and the broadcast networks’ definition of prime time allowed CBS to eke out a win against Fox News in June and July.
But Fox News was the king of 8 to 11 p.m., in part because conservative viewers have few options for right-wing political commentary. Smaller networks like Newsmax and One America News have tried to siphon off viewers but lag far behind.
MSNBC, whose liberal prime time is an ideological inverse to Fox News, has increased its audience from a year ago. But Rachel Maddow, once neck and neck with Hannity at 9 p.m., has fallen behind all three of Fox News’ prime-time stars in total viewers. Ingraham, who appears in the less desirable 10 p.m. slot, has drawn more viewers than Maddow for many months.
Fox News won praise this summer thanks to several newsmaking interviews with Trump, including Chris Wallace’s grilling on “Fox News Sunday” and an interview with Harris Faulkner in which Trump struggled to address racial grievances. Even Trump’s June forum with Hannity yielded headlines when the president could not name a policy priority for a second term.
But the network’s critics said the language of its prime-time hosts can be reckless. Carlson has faced a particular backlash since Floyd’s death in Minneapolis in late May sparked nationwide demonstrations for civil rights.
Major advertisers, including the Walt Disney Co., T-Mobile and Poshmark, boycotted his program as Carlson denounced the protesters as violent anarchists. Later, the host called Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a wounded veteran, a “moron” and questioned her patriotism. In recent days, Carlson called former President Barack Obama a “greasy politician” and wondered if Floyd’s death had been caused by drug use rather than being pinned to the ground by a police officer.
Carlson’s ratings have never been higher. And based on Murdoch’s telling, the boycott had little effect on Fox News’ bottom line. Carlson’s show has virtually no major sponsors, but many ads were redistributed to other programs on the network. Fox News also continues to make a fortune in so-called carriage fees, the money paid by cable and satellite providers to keep the network in their lineups.
Fox News vigorously defends itself from critics who say its news coverage is biased or its commentators are extreme. When a writer for Carlson, Blake Neff, resigned in July because of racist and sexist messages he had posted in an online forum, Fox News’ chief executive, Suzanne Scott, publicly denounced his conduct as “abhorrent.” Carlson issued a halfhearted mea culpa, saying Neff’s posts were “wrong” but also warning that his critics would be “punished.”
Murdoch was made aware of Carlson’s on-air remarks before the broadcast, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange, which was reported earlier by The Daily Beast.
CBS remains neck-and-neck with Fox News in the 8 to 11 p.m. slot and could still take the summer crown.
On Wednesday, however, CBS aired what should have been a major draw: the two-hour season premiere of the reality show “Big Brother,” a rare new episode amid a raft of summer reruns.
“Big Brother” was seen by an average of 3.7 million live viewers. “Tucker Carlson Tonight” lured 3.9 million and “Hannity” just shy of 4 million — the most-watched telecast of the night.

CHICAGO — Hundreds of people converged early Monday on the Magnificent Mile, Chicago’s most famous shopping district, breaking windows, looting stores and clashing with police, a chaotic scene that prompted city officials to briefly raise bridges downtown and halt nearby public transit to stem the unrest.
Chicago police officers arrested more than 100 people on charges of disorderly conduct, looting and battery against the police.
The eruption of violence unnerved a city that is already on edge. Chicago, like many other cities across the country, has seen a spike in gun crimes this summer. Its residents have participated in dozens of demonstrations protesting police brutality. And it is still in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic, with cases steadily increasing in recent weeks.
Mayor Lori Lightfoot, appearing at a morning news conference, made it clear that she saw no connection between the unrest overnight and what she described as a “righteous uprising” after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in May.
“We are waking up in shock this morning,” Lightfoot said. “What occurred downtown and in surrounding communities was abject criminal behavior, pure and simple.”
Still, the Chicago police superintendent said that the chaos that unfolded downtown had apparently grown out of a shooting that took place on the South Side on Sunday afternoon. “Seeds” for the widespread looting were “sown,” David Brown, the superintendent, said, after police officers and a man shot at one another in the city’s Englewood neighborhood.
Around 2:30 p.m. Sunday, officers were called to investigate reports of a man with a gun, the department said. Officers confronted a 20-year-old man in an alley, he fled and then opened fire, the department said in a statement.
“Officers then discharged their firearms, striking the offender,” the statement said.
The man, who was not identified, was “expected to survive,” Brown said, and no officers were hurt. The department said it had opened an investigation into the shooting.
After the shooting, a crowd in the neighborhood confronted officers, Brown said.
“Tempers flared, fueled by misinformation as the afternoon turned into evening,” he said. “That grew and grew into the late-night hours.”
Then police learned of a social media post about potential looting downtown, miles from where the shooting had taken place. More than 400 officers were quickly dispatched to the area, where they encountered people entering various businesses, vandalizing storefronts and smashing windows. In one widely viewed recording, police officers can be seen confronting a group of people in the street when someone hurled an object at one of the officers, striking him in the face. He and other officers then charged the people, who fled.
Officials said that 13 officers were injured, including one struck with a bottle and another whose nose was broken. A security guard and a civilian were struck during the unfolding violence, Brown said, and both were taken to a hospital in critical condition.
By morning, the Chicago Transit Authority said that at least half a dozen bus and train lines were shut down “at the request of public safety officials.” Around 8 a.m. local time, service began to resume, and the city lowered the bridges over the Chicago River. The city has raised the bridges several times this summer, in an effort to limit access to the city’s main business and shopping district during protests against racism and police violence.
Lightfoot said the looting and shutdown came as many businesses were struggling to try to get back on their feet after coronavirus-related closures and urged the community to support their fragile recovery.
The officials said that a special team of investigators were looking through surveillance video to try to arrest more people who took part in the looting, which Lightfoot described as “straight-up felony criminal conduct.”
Dozens of police officers remained downtown Monday. Business owners began to pick through the damage: cash registers overturned in a pharmacy, windows broken at high-end stores, empty boxes scattered outside a jewelry store.

Trump Led From Briefing Room After Shooting Outside White House [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was abruptly pulled out of the White House Briefing Room in midsentence during a televised news conference Monday after a shooting near the Executive Mansion.
Trump had just kicked off his recently revived coronavirus daily briefing with an attack on mail-in voting and a prediction that the stock market would be “topping records, hopefully soon” when a Secret Service agent standing to his right interrupted him.
“We have shots fired outside,” the agent said quietly to the president. After being instructed to leave the room, Trump and his aides — including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Russell T. Vought, the budget director — calmly exited without immediate explanation.
The president returned a few minutes later to report that there had been a shooting by the Secret Service outside the White House grounds, near the fence. But he said he was eager to continue his news conference.
Trump said a suspect had been armed and was on the way to the hospital but that he did not know the suspect’s condition. No law enforcement officers were injured, the president said. On Twitter, the official Secret Service account confirmed an officer-involved shooting at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, near the White House, but offered no further details.
“It might not have anything to do with me — it may have been something else,” Trump said, complimenting new fencing that has turned the White House complex into more of a sealed-off fortress as “very powerful.”
“Do I seem rattled?” he said, noting that he had simply been taken to the Oval Office. “It’s unfortunate that this is the world, but the world has always been a dangerous place. It’s not something that’s unique.”
Trump seemed eager to rehash his decision to return, processing the unusual interruption in real time with reporters in the Briefing Room. “I didn’t even consider not coming back,” said the television-centric president.
And then, almost without missing a beat, Trump picked up where he left off, noting that the “Nasdaq is setting new records.”
The president has been eager in the past to present himself as stoic in the face of potential threats to his personal safety. In May, as hundreds of protesters gathered on the streets in front of the White House, some throwing bricks and bottles, Trump and his family were briefly taken by the Secret Service to an underground bunker that has been used as a safe house for presidents during terrorist attacks.
Trump was livid that news of his visit to the bunker got out, and he later denied that it had anything to do with fear for his safety. “I was down during the day, and I was there for a tiny, little short period of time,” he claimed. “It was much more for an inspection.”
On Monday, he and his aides were eager to frame his quick return to the briefing as a macho sign of strength. Alyssa Farah, the White House communications director, tweeted an emoji of a flexing muscle and an American flag and called Trump “Our Commander-in-Chief” for quickly turning his attention back to Wall Street. Other aides described the decision to return quickly to the shutter of the cameras as “bad ass.”
Trump, for his part, appeared eager for more details about what had occurred, at one point turning to a Fox News correspondent who had reported that he heard the shots to elaborate on what he knew.
“You are outside; you heard shots fired before?” Trump asked John Roberts, the White House correspondent for Fox News. Roberts said he heard two shots fired.
“And they were shots, pretty much?” Trump asked. “You know the difference, and you thought they were shots?”

Porsha in Protest [With graphic(s)]

“Everybody should enjoy ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta,’ ” said Porsha Williams, the doe-eyed star of same, whose comedic verve and penchant for interpersonal chaos have made her one of the most popular cast members on one of the most popular shows on television.
“This is what I don’t like when it would come to one of our viewers: If they felt like Black Lives Matter was anti-white, or us saying ‘Black lives matter’ excludes them in any type of way.”
Williams, 39, was casually resplendent on Zoom, in a black T-shirt and hot pink leggings among cream cushions in her Atlanta home. Printed in an emphatic column down the front of her shirt: “BREONNA TAYLOR BREONNA TAYLOR BREONNA TAYLOR” — the name of the 26-year-old emergency medical technician who Louisville, Kentucky, police officers shot and killed after bursting into her apartment shortly after midnight on March 13.
Three days before this interview in July, Williams had been among 87 protesters arrested outside the home of Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, while calling on him to file criminal charges against those officers. She was charged with criminal trespassing, disorderly conduct and intimidating a participant in a legal process (a felony, later dropped).
“I think it’s really important,” she said, “for people to see themselves in the movement and know that you have a place. You’ve played a part, you have a place, and you can also be a catalyst for change.”
“We are having a fight for ourselves, but it’s also really important for whites to say, ‘I’m not going to take it anymore.’ ”
On Bravo, where blond network stars outnumber cast members of color, “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” stands out for its all-Black female cast, and for its ratings.
If sized proportionately to each show’s reach, the quasi-Renaissance iconography that pervades “Real Housewives” opening credit sequences (in Orange County, the women clutch oranges; in New York City: apples), every peach held aloft by an Atlanta cast member would resemble the monstrous stone fruit envisioned by Roald Dahl. “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” is not just the No. 1 show in the “Real Housewives” franchise, or on Bravo; according to Nielsen it is one of the most-watched unscripted shows on all of cable.
“Real Housewives” cameras documented Williams’ existence over the past year as she vacationed in Greece, navigated a fraught romantic relationship and told her castmate Eva she looked like a thumb. The show’s 12th season concluded May 24 with the third installment of a reunion special filmed remotely. The next day, George Floyd was killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
On May 27, Williams shared his image on Instagram. In an emotional caption, she wrote to her nearly 6 million followers that it had taken her “all day to build up the courage,” to watch the almost-nine-minute video of Derek Chauvin, the police officer, kneeling on his neck.
“I have cried and I’ve been hurt most of the day and even still tonight!” Williams wrote.
Two days later, on his own Instagram account, Andy Cohen, a “Real Housewives” executive producer, reposted a fan’s video of Williams being interviewed at an Atlanta protest against police brutality.
“We are not going to sit at home,” Williams said through a mask on the local news. “We’re going to march. We’re going to lift our voice, and we are going to be heard.”
“Making Hosea proud,” Cohen wrote in the caption of his post. (Cohen, who on camera functions as both a Bravo viewer surrogate and the personification of network authority, rarely shares photos or videos of individual “Housewives” on his personal account, perhaps to avoid appearances of favoritism; he is the referee of cast reunion shows.)
“Hosea” is the Rev. Hosea Williams, Williams’ grandfather and a prominent civil rights activist, who died in 2000. In 1965, alongside future U.S. Rep. John Lewis, he tried to conduct a crowd of 600 marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
Some three decades later, Williams, age 5, accompanied her grandfather on her first march, in Cumming, Georgia, in a demonstration against continuing segregation.
“I’m singing ‘We Shall Overcome,’ and I’m seeing my grandfather be the leader of this march, this protest,” Williams recalled. The Ku Klux Klan met the demonstrators.
“And the KKK started to throw rocks at us. They called us the N-word over and over.” In her memory, the peaceful scene became “chaotic,” as marchers rushed back to the buses that had transported them from Atlanta. The New York Times reported in a front-page article that Sunday that counterprotesters were arrested on charges of possession of weapons including “bows and arrows.”
“My feelings were so hurt that anybody — well, I just didn’t understand why they hated us,” Williams said. “I didn’t even really understand what the word meant, but I know that the way that it was said to me, it was with such hate.”
“As I got older, of course — and I’m not talking, like, a teenager, I mean, like, 10, 11,” her parents told her, “‘People are going to mistreat you because of the color of your skin.’ But then they also told me what the color of my skin meant: I am a queen, my brothers are kings,” Williams said. “My family taught us that this is something that’s important to them, and that is what they were fighting for.”
Like many millennials who grew up supporting civil rights habitually, if less assertively than the legends of the 1960s (whose exalted peerlessness became, over time, a self-fulfilling reputation), Williams felt a radical urgency and responsibility to act after Floyd’s death.
“When I saw that video of George Floyd being murdered, I knew that I had to change the way I was moving,” she said. “That meant now I have to sacrifice myself, my finance, my brand, my everything, and put it all on the line for change.”
“I’m in the house trying to save my life and not put myself at risk to get this killer virus,” Williams said after several months at home. “And then here I am going out of my house again, now, to fight for my life and fight for African Americans not to be killed in the street.”
The resolve to join in arrived swiftly, she said, “because I have a little girl in the house. And it doesn’t take but a second for a mother to think about the fact that they want their child to be healthy, well and have a good life.” Williams’ daughter is 16 months old.
A record of Williams’ snap decision-making is preserved in her Instagram comments. She learned of one Atlanta march when a follower shared details in a reply left on a post Williams had uploaded earlier that day. (“We would love to have your support!!” the follower wrote.)
“Not degrading or putting her down, I love Porsha, but that’s just not her cup of tea,” a fan responded to the thread.
Williams sent a one-word reply as well: “When.”
“I literally finished what I was doing, and I got in my car, called my sister, called my fiancé, and we met and went to the City Hall protest,” she said. “It can happen just like that.”
In a harrowing video uploaded to her account on June 1, Williams captured her own dash for safety after she and other demonstrators were hit with tear gas while congregating near the Georgia Capitol. In the clip, Williams runs frantically for blocks, screaming as riot-control munitions explode in the distance. She stops only when a stranger catches hold of her to pour milk over her face.
When dressing for protests, Williams dons two shirts “in case I need to take one off and run, so you can’t identify me,” she said. “I have on two pair of pants in case I want to take a pair off.” She writes telephone numbers on her arm, in case she is jailed.
“And I wear a face covering because we are in a pandemic!”
Other than lip balm (tucked into her waistband) and identification (tucked into her bra) she brings nothing.
“That’s it. And I am ready to go.”
Peaches to Protests
While it is common for “Housewives” to stay for several seasons — a decade or more in some cases — it is the rare cast member who exhibits what may be deemed positive personal growth during her tenure.
Williams’ trajectory, then, is exceptional. Since entwining her fate with Bravo’s eight years ago, she has left an unhappy marriage; given birth to a longed-for child; become a businesswoman selling both the “highest quality” virgin hair extensions and the “highest quality” bedsheets; and blossomed into a confident, quick-witted screen presence inclined to settle for delight where others find frustration.
Among “Housewives” devotees, “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” are widely regarded as the most intentionally funny cast — a distinction bolstered in nearly every episode by Williams, whose apparently chronic guilelessness is, like that of Lucy Ricardo, no less enjoyable for its comedic convenience. (“I have always made incredible television whether I meant to or not,” Williams said.)
But when discussing the topic of police brutality in the wake of her arrest in Louisville (she was released from jail around 3 a.m., hours after being taken into custody), Williams was logical and judicious about what she saw as the highest-priority issues, and her own role in addressing them.
“When I sat on that lawn and knew that those cops — my life was in their hands. They could do anything to me,” she said.
She pointed out that the day before she traveled to Louisville, July 13, was the five-year anniversary of Sandra Bland’s death while in police custody.
“God rest her soul,” Williams said. “I did not know if I was facing an unfortunate demise like that.”
“When I placed myself on that line, even though I was peaceful, even though I was nonviolent, in the past I’ve protested and been all those things, and I got shot with gas, bullets, etc.”
“I’m not going to sit here and say that I wasn’t afraid,” she said, “but I wasn’t nervous because I knew that I was there for a noble cause.”
“I honestly feel like if we don’t get justice for Breonna Taylor, then there is no justice for anyone. All of our rights will be violated in the future,” Williams said. “We can all expect to possibly be in our home, asleep, in our sanctuary and have our door knocked down and have eight bullets be put into our body and laid to rest without being able to tell our mothers goodbye.”
‘That Doesn’t Make Any Sense’
Outside the realm of Bravo, “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” remain conspicuous in the form of reaction GIFs: looping, soundless clips used to express emotions online. While critics have cautioned that, when repurposed by people who are not Black, such contextless visual shorthand can veer into “digital blackface,” Williams interprets her GIF ubiquity as a sign of pop culture relevance.
“If it’s a white person, they enjoy our show, they enjoy the character, they may think what I said is funny — I personally don’t have an issue with that,” she said.
At the same time, she stressed, she wants white fans to give as much consideration to her off-camera rights and safety as they do her cheeky bons mots. If viewers feel unaligned with the Black Lives Matter movement, Williams suggested, “I would like them to further educate themselves.”
For instance, she said, “Someone gave me a statistic the other day that in America, for 2020, there are 13% of African Americans here, 76% of white people. So that’s about a 63% difference in how many people are here”; yet, in terms of civilians shot to death by police, “it’s only a 100-person difference.” (As of July 29, Statista calculated that police had fatally shot 111 Black people and 215 white people in 2020.)
“Now, that doesn’t make any sense,” Williams said. “To me, if white people knew things like that, and they would understand why we say, ‘Black lives matter’ — because Black lives are being murdered at a disproportionate number to white people.”
Williams said she thinks that every American should take the time to watch the video of Floyd’s fatal police encounter.
“I think they should not only watch it, I think that they should find out why it happened,” she said.
“You have to understand that this has been systematic oppression. And sometimes we can get into a place and feel complacent. ‘Life is fine. I have Black friends. They seem to be treated well. They make pretty good money.’ But you don’t really understand and feel our pain unless you understand where it comes from.”
“The system has been set up this way,” she said, so that police officers “know that they have this immunity; they know that they are protected; they know that they can say that they feared for their life; they know that they can boldly kill a human being on camera while looking into the lens.”
“We pay these cops,” she added. “There should be no reason that they are out here being the judge, the jury and the executioner.”
With respect to the caliber of its impact, Williams compared the footage of Floyd to the photos of civil rights activists being attacked while protesting peacefully in the 1960s.
“Those civil rights activists sacrificed themselves in front of the camera so that America could see its ugly truth,” she said. “If you really don’t see its brutal, ugly, evil truth, and you don’t feel it in your heart, then you won’t truly, truly be able to stand for change.”
“I think that it has been very important for people to see videos such as George Floyd’s, for them to be able to feel our pain and decide that they’re not going to take it anymore.”
Williams’ hope is that people who consider themselves proud Americans will find the officers’ behavior antithetical to their values, and demand change.
“How can you be proud of a country that is oppressing and snuffing out African Americans like it is nothing?” she said emphatically. “How can you be proud of where you live, and you have a home, you own it, you raising your kids in a place that could do something so evil?”
In the first few weeks after Floyd’s death, even as she became more active in protests in Atlanta, Williams said she felt “almost like I was headed into a depression,” brought on by the distress of the pandemic and the tidal wave of recent stories and videos of police brutality.
“I just was in a very low place. But I decided to channel that energy and become even more active. I said, ‘I need to start going to town hall meetings. I need to start going to public forums. I need to get out there, and do things and talk to other people who are also about change.’”
“I still have to make money, and take care of my daughter and my family,” Williams said.
But, encouraged by an aunt, she began to view her new habits as a possible calling. The same aunt advised Williams to evaluate her emotions from a religious perspective.
“She explained to me that the sadness that I was feeling was me being in, also, spiritual warfare because the devil doesn’t want you to do right for God’s people,” Williams said.
“He wants evil to prevail. He wants white supremacists to continue to oppress African Americans — although there are amazing white people out there. He wants the ones who are evil to keep this division going.”
Williams credits her faith with making her feel “empowered” in her aims. She said she has been praying more than usual — “Absolutely!”
The Right Side of History
In June, Bravo invited Williams and comedian W. Kamau Bell to join Cohen for a televised conversation about Black Lives Matter. In the days that followed, the network announced a squall of firings of cast members across multiple shows, all stemming from past incidents of racist behavior. On Aug. 9, a mix of Black and white Bravo stars, including Williams, participated in another Bravo special: a round table discussion of race in America.
“For me, being an African American woman working for a network, and I’m a part of their No. 1 show, which is African American women — I am proud of them,” Williams said of Bravo’s response. Network executives, she added, had phone calls with Black talent “about what’s important to us, and what changes we would like to see.”
“I don’t think anybody needs to question what we are feeling right now, because Bravo has African American talent to be able to speak to it,” she said.
“I’m so glad that they’ve decided to be on the right side of history.”
Williams felt, too, that her castmates’ estimations of her had shifted over the past months.
“I think that I’ve gained more of their respect,” she said. “They can see me sacrificing. They understand that not all brands want to support a cause such as this.” Several co-stars sent texts expressing support and asking how they might help — behavior she said did not surprise her, despite several seasons’ worth of past conflicts.
“I know these Black women. These Black women are strong. These Black women are vocal. And these Black women are able to set aside any differences that we are having,” she said.
She continued with exemplary shade: “So I’m proud of a few of these women and what they are doing, for sure.”
Asked if any white “Housewives” had been helpful, Williams attempted diplomacy.
“Um, you know ...” she began, before breaking into a peal of laughter. “I haven’t really talked to any of the white women!”
“Listen,” she said, and flashed a winning smile, “even though we’ve been in quarantine, I’ve been busy as hell!”

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It started with an afternoon stop at a gas station. Two customers began exchanging angry stares near the pumps outside — and no one can explain exactly why.
That led to an argument, and it escalated quickly as one of them pulled a gun and they struggled over it, according to police.
“There’s too many shootings. Please don’t do this,” the wife of one of the men pleaded, stepping between them.
But by the time the fight was over at the station on Kansas City’s East Side late last month, the all-too-familiar crackle of gunfire pierced the humid air, leaving another person dead in what has been an exceedingly bloody summer.
The onset of warm weather nearly always brings with it a spike in violent crime, but with much of the country emerging from weeks of lockdown from the coronavirus, the increase this year has been much steeper than usual.
Across 20 major cities, the murder rate at the end of June was on average 37% higher than it was at the end of May, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The increase over the same period a year ago was just 6%.
In few places has the bloodshed been more devastating than in Kansas City, where the city is on pace to shatter its record for homicides in a year. Much of it has involved incidents of random, angry violence like the conflict at the gas station — disputes between strangers that left someone dead, or killings that simply cannot be explained. They have claimed the lives of a pregnant woman pushing a stroller, a 4-year-old boy asleep in his grandmother’s home and a teenage girl sitting in a car.
They have also prompted a much-debated intervention from the federal government, an operation named after the 4-year-old Kansas City boy, LeGend Taliferro, that has sent federal law enforcement agents to at least six cities in an attempt to intervene.
“We’re surrounded by murder, and it’s almost like your number is up,” said Erica Mosby, whose niece, Diamon Eichelburger, 20, was the pregnant victim pushing the stroller in Kansas City. “It’s terrible.”
Nationally, crime remains at or near a generational low, and experts caution against drawing conclusions from just a few months.
But President Donald Trump has used the rising homicide numbers to paint Democratic-led cities as out of control and to blame protests against police brutality that broke out after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May.
“Extreme politicians have joined this anti-police crusade and relentlessly vilified our law enforcement heroes,” Trump said during a White House news conference last month to announce Operation LeGend. He added that “the effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders.”
Criminologists dispute the president’s suggestion that the increase is tied to any pullback by police in response to criticism or defunding efforts, and fluctuations in the crime rate are notoriously hard to explain. In many cities, the murder rate was on the rise before the pandemic, and a steep decline in arrests coincided with the start of social distancing, as measured by mobile phone records, according to a database compiled by David Abrams, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania law school.
Some experts have pointed to the pandemic’s destabilization of community institutions, or theorized that people with a propensity for violence may have been less likely to heed stay-at-home orders. But in city after city, crime overall is down, including all types of major crime except murder, aggravated assault and in some places, car theft.
In New York, where killings are up 30% over last year, city and police officials have tried to lay blame on a new law that lets many defendants go free without posting bond, as well as on the coronavirus-related mass release of people from jail. But the evidence shows that a steep decline in gun arrests beginning in mid-May was a more likely cause. Police officials in several cities have said the protests diverted officers from crime-fighting duty or emboldened criminals.
In Detroit, Chief James Craig said violence spiked but has started to go down over the past two weekends.
“We haven’t relaxed our enforcement posture like some cities,” he said.
In Kansas City, homicides have been on a swift upward trajectory from the time a 41-year-old man named Earl Finch III was gunned down in a driveway in broad daylight on Jan. 5, the first killing of the year. Even the coronavirus lockdown did not slow the violence, though as in other cities it has escalated even further in the wake of reopenings.
After six new deaths over the weekend, 122 people have been killed this year, compared with 90 through the same time last year. The city is well on its way to surpassing its grim record of 153 killings in 1993. And by the end of July the city had matched the number of nonfatal shootings — about 490 — that it had all of last year.
Much of the violence in Kansas City has had little rhyme or reason, often stemming from petty arguments that boil over.
The short fuses may indicate restlessness and anger, criminologists and law enforcement officials said. Police have attributed about 30 of the homicides this year to arguments, some involving people with no serious criminal history. Economic hardship also appeared to be a factor in some of the killings. Only 15 were deemed drug-related. In almost 50 cases, police have not yet determined a motive.
While disparities in things like education and employment have long plagued Kansas City’s East Side, a predominantly Black part of the city that has the city’s highest murder rate, community leaders said there seemed to be an added sense of despair this year.
The Rev. Darren Faulkner, who runs a program that provides social support to those deemed most at risk of violence, said the latest wave of police killings of Black people has left many of his clients feeling hopelessly trapped in a system in which they will never thrive.
“People have gotten to the point where they just don’t give a damn,” he said. “I don’t care about me. I certainly don’t care about you. And so I can go shoot your house or shoot you right on the spot because you talked to me crazy, you looked at me crazy.”
Spontaneous, one-on-one beefs have replaced gang feuds as a driver of shootings, said Maj. Greg Volker of the Kansas City Police Department.
“If people could settle an argument without having to resort to shooting, violence would reduce,” he said.
Another atypical trend this year is that in several cases, the gunmen and victims were not otherwise involved in criminal activity, Volker said, pointing to the gas station shooting in July.
The man now charged with murder in the case is a meatpacking worker, Isaac Knighten, 40, who devotes much of his time to mentoring Black men and boys, including teaching conflict resolution through Alpha Male Nation, a mentoring organization his brother started. His wife said he had turned his life around after serving time on drug charges from more than a decade ago.
After Knighten had a brief, hostile exchange with the other man in the parking lot, the man, Jayvon McCray, 28, pulled a gun and the men began to fight, according to police.
Knighten’s wife, Shaynan, said in an interview that she had their five children get out of the car and run to a relative’s house nearby. She and McCray’s girlfriend both got between the men and urged them to calm down, according to police.
Knighten eventually retrieved a gun from his car and fatally shot McCray, whom police said appeared to no longer be holding a gun.
Knighten’s lawyer, Dan Ross, said his client, who has been charged with second-degree murder, was defending himself. Surveillance footage shows that Knighten attempted to walk away from the dispute at least six times, but McCray kept coming after him, the lawyer said.
Another contributing factor to this year’s violence, Volker said, was the impact of the coronavirus stay-at-home order on the drug trade. Some dealers lost their regular buyers, so they sold to people they did not know — people who may have been intent on robbing them. The result has been an uptick in drug robberies and shootings, especially in late March and early April.
The real explosion of killings in Kansas City came in May and June, with 44 combined, more than twice as many during those same months last year.
“I’m sure there will be academic studies for years to come as to what caused the spike of 2020,” said Tim Garrison, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri. “I’m sure the lockdown didn’t help. When you already have a stressed economic situation and you put a lot of folks out of work, and a lot of teenagers out of school, it’s a volatile situation.”
Garrison oversees Operation LeGend, a surge of some 200 federal agents into Kansas City in an effort to help stem the violence. It has been met with suspicion and street protests, in part because the operation coincided with a militaristic federal intervention on the streets of Portland, Oregon, that was widely criticized for inflaming tensions there.
Garrison said trained federal investigators have beefed up existing task forces, seized dozens of guns, brought in suspects on existing warrants and helped arrest a dozen homicide suspects.
Jean Peters Baker, the prosecutor in Jackson County, said that in the murder cases she has received from Operation LeGend so far, the federal agents did not appear to have contributed the forensic investigative expertise that the federal authorities had promised.
Garrison pointed to a more recent arrest by the U.S. Marshals Service, saying that federal investigators had linked a firearm found in the suspect’s possession to four other shootings.
The operation has been expanded to seven other cities, all but one of which have seen an increase in homicides over last year. Some officials have welcomed the help, while others have promised to monitor federal agents for civil rights violations.
The federal operation represents the latest in a string of efforts that Kansas City has undertaken to try to get its violence under control over the years. Homicides dropped to a near record low of 80 in 2014, after the launch of a joint federal-local operation known as the Kansas City No Violence Alliance. But killings began ticking back up in subsequent years, and police pulled back from the program. The department plans to launch a new effort in September that focuses on getting the most persistent violent offenders off the streets.
Charron Powell, LeGend’s mother, said she gave permission for her son’s name to be used in the federal operation because she wanted the fight against violence to be his legacy. She called the killings “senseless” and said those responsible had met with too few consequences.
“It may not work,” she said, noting the opposition Operation LeGend has encountered from many in the city. Still, she said, “it’s a good thing they’re trying — they’re trying something.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Nearly 11 weeks after George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, inciting a wave of protests across the United States, a Minnesota county court has released police body camera footage of the episode to the public for the first time.
The New York Times has reviewed the full 65 minutes of footage, which was previously viewable only by appointment, and selected crucial moments that offer new information.
The footage fills in blanks, raises new questions and gives insight into both Floyd’s state of mind and how the police response to his apparent use of a counterfeit bill became a deadly encounter. It shows officers escalating the situation from the beginning of the arrest, Floyd begging not to be placed into a squad car and a repeated lack of care for Floyd’s health while he is restrained on the ground.
The footage was taken from the body cameras of officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, who detained Floyd on May 25. The camera of a third officer, Derek Chauvin, who appeared in widely viewed footage kneeling on Floyd’s neck, fell off during the arrest, and its footage has not been released. Lane, Kueng and a fourth officer, Tou Thao, have been charged with aiding and abetting murder, and manslaughter, while Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The officers were all fired after Floyd’s killing.
Escalation
At 8:09 p.m., Lane can be seen approaching a car containing Floyd and two companions, Shawanda Hill and Maurice Lester Hall. Lane’s footage shows how quickly he seems to escalate the situation.
Floyd sits in the driver’s seat, and Lane taps his flashlight on the window. He asks Floyd to show his hands and taps again when Floyd does not comply.
When Floyd — who appears to be looking toward the passenger side where Kueng is standing — does not comply with the order, Lane taps again.
Floyd is visibly taken aback and then apologizes while opening the car door.
Lane tells Floyd to show his hands three more times. Six seconds after the door opens, he draws his gun, points it at Floyd and says, “Put your [expletive] hands up right now.” Without explaining the reason for the stop, he pulls Floyd out of the car.
Claim of Previous Shooting
The body camera footage from Lane and Kueng reveals one possible reason for Floyd’s fear: Both Floyd and Hill tell the officers multiple times that Floyd has previously been shot in a similar situation.
“Man, I got shot the same way, Mr. Officer, before,” Floyd tells Lane. “Last time I got shot like this, Mr. Officer, it was the same thing.”
Later, Lane asks Hill why Floyd is being so “squirrelly.”
“He’s got a thing going on, I’m telling you, about the police,” Hill says while pointing her finger to her head and making a circular motion with her finger.
The Times was not able to verify whether or not Floyd had been previously shot during an encounter with police, but a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said Monday that its officers had not previously shot Floyd.
Struggle
The footage also offers a new view of the struggle to put Floyd into the squad car and an explanation of how Floyd ended up facedown on the street, where officers would pin him for nine minutes and 30 seconds.
After removing Floyd from his vehicle, Lane and Kueng handcuff him and walk him across the street to their squad car.
Floyd can be heard telling the officers that he is claustrophobic. Lane promises to keep the rear window partly open, but Floyd resists their efforts to get him into the car.
A minute later, Floyd tells the officers that he has had the coronavirus, which a medical examiner’s report later confirmed.
“I’m going to die, man,” he says. “And I just had COVID, man. I don’t want to go back to that.” He uses an expletive to describe how scared he is, then offers to count to three before getting in, sit in a front seat or get on the ground instead. The officers insist that he sit in the back.
Lane moves to the other side of the car and opens the door. Floyd shouts that he is “not a bad guy” as the struggle to force him into the back seat begins.
Restraint
Before the release of the body camera footage, it was unclear how Floyd exited the squad car after being forced inside and exactly what happened after the officers had him pinned.
The new footage shows that as Lane and Kueng try to force Floyd into the back seat, Floyd shouts that he cannot breathe, says that he has injured his nose and appears to use his legs to push himself out the other side, repeating, “I’m going to lay on the ground.”
After about a minute of struggle to push Floyd back into the car, Thao, who is watching from the side, says, “Let’s lay him,” and Chauvin and Kueng move Floyd onto the pavement.
Lane’s and Kueng’s videos provide the first clear evidence of the time Chauvin places his knee on Floyd’s neck, changing the widely known narrative that Chauvin held his knee there for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Prosecutors initially gave this duration, then changed it to seven minutes and 46 seconds. The footage shows that neither were correct: Chauvin actually keeps his knee on Floyd’s neck from 8:19 until 8:28 p.m., for a total of nine minutes and 30 seconds. That is nearly two minutes more than the prosecutors’ amended time.
Lane’s footage also provides a new and revealing view of how the officers restrain Floyd.
Lane prepares to use a beltlike hobble restraint on Floyd but then puts it away, possibly indicating that the officers feel they have Floyd under control. From this perspective, Chauvin can be seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck and arm and gripping his left hand. Kueng is kneeling on Floyd’s upper legs and holding his wrist, while Lane is holding Floyd’s legs.
Delay in Medical Care
The body camera footage also shows delays by the officers and the paramedics who respond.
“This is a cascade of everything going wrong,” said Rohini J. Haar, a medical expert at Physicians for Human Rights, who reviewed the footage for The Times. “And they never recorrected course, even inside the ambulance.”
Six minutes after Chauvin, Lane and Kueng put Floyd facedown, and only after bystanders have shouted at the officers to attend to Floyd’s health, Kueng checks for Floyd’s pulse and tells Chauvin and Lane that he cannot feel it. All three of the officers continue to hold Floyd in a position that restricts his breathing, and none check to see whether he is getting air.
Two minutes later, emergency responders arrive and check Floyd’s pulse but do not assess his breathing. Instead of repositioning Floyd to assess or treat him on the scene, the medics load him into the ambulance as Lane joins them.
It takes three minutes after their arrival on the scene — and four more pulse checks — before Lane begins first chest compressions. It is five additional minutes before a medic ventilates Floyd — 10 minutes after Kueng first reported Floyd did not have a pulse. Lane eventually leaves the ambulance when the Fire Department arrives.
A spokeswoman for the Hennepin County Medical Center did not respond to an emailed request for comment asking why paramedics did not begin chest compressions sooner.
“They spend an unthinkable amount of minutes taking his shirt off before they even check his breathing,” Haar said. “You can do CPR with a shirt on.”

Sen. Kamala Harris of California will be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party. A pragmatic moderate and one of Joe Biden’s former rivals in the presidential race, Harris was a barrier-breaking prosecutor before being elected to the Senate in 2016.
Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California. She is a former attorney general of California and a former San Francisco district attorney.
When she announced her own bid for the presidency — on Martin Luther King’s Birthday in 2019 — she pitched herself as a history-making candidate, paying homage to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.
Prosecutorial Background
Before she was a senator, Harris was a prosecutor, elected as the San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and as California’s attorney general in 2010. She held that position until she won her Senate seat in 2016.
Harris made this part of her career a major theme of her presidential campaign, describing herself as a “progressive prosecutor” and arguing that it was possible to be tough on crime while also confronting the deep inequities of the criminal justice system. Part of her argument was that voters could trust her to overhaul the system because she knew it “from the inside out.” But some parts of her record were a source of criticism from the left.
Her prosecutorial record will almost certainly be raised in the general election, especially amid the national outcry over police brutality and systemic racism that has followed the killing of George Floyd.
Senate Career
Elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris was the first Black woman in the chamber in more than a decade. During her relatively brief time as California’s junior senator, she has become known for her intensive interrogations of Trump administration officials and nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
In recent years, she had sought to align herself more with the Democratic Party’s left wing, initially supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” bill before shifting her position during the presidential campaign. She has also been a vocal supporter of racial justice legislation since the killing of Floyd.
Presidential C ampaign
While Harris dropped out of the presidential race late last year after running low on money, she entered as one of the front-runners and had a significant impact on the trajectory of the campaign.
Part of her influence was ideological: She was the first candidate, for instance, to suggest requiring federal preclearance for state abortion restrictions, a position that numerous top candidates later expressed support for. And part of it stemmed from her debate performances, including an electric moment in the first debate.
On the stage in June, she forcefully challenged Biden over his record on race and, specifically, busing. It was “hurtful,” she said, to hear Biden speak positively about working with segregationist senators, because “there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day, and that little girl was me.”
How Voters May View Her Selection
During her presidential campaign, Harris appealed in particular to more moderate Democrats and those drawn to her biography. She could reinforce Biden’s appeal with Black women and women generally who are eager to see themselves reflected in the country’s leadership.
The progressive left, including some supporters of Sanders, will most likely be disappointed in Harris’ selection, viewing her as far more supportive of incremental change than the kind of broad, revolutionary proposals they champion.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, whom Joe Biden chose on Tuesday as his running mate, will be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party. A pragmatic moderate and one of Biden’s former rivals in the presidential race, Harris was a barrier-breaking prosecutor before being elected to the Senate in 2016.
Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California. She is a former attorney general of California and a former San Francisco district attorney.
When she announced her own bid for the presidency — on Martin Luther King’s Birthday in 2019 — she pitched herself as a history-making candidate, paying homage to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.
Prosecutorial Background
Harris’ record as a prosecutor — she was the San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011, and the California attorney general from 2011 to 2017 — was a major theme of her presidential campaign and will almost certainly be discussed in the general election, especially given the national outcry over police brutality and systemic racism since the killing of George Floyd.
Harris has described herself as a “progressive prosecutor” and argued that it is possible to be tough on crime while also confronting the deep inequities of the criminal justice system. She has said she became a prosecutor because she believed she could best change the system from within, a message that became a key part of her pitch as a presidential candidate: that voters could trust her to overhaul the justice system because she knew it “from the inside out.”
But aspects of her record have been a source of criticism, especially from the left.
As attorney general, she rarely prosecuted police officers who killed civilians, though by the time she left that office, she had opened some reviews of police departments. She was also criticized for refusing to allow advanced DNA testing that might have exonerated Kevin Cooper, a Black man on death row, and for defending some convictions against allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.
An opponent of the death penalty, she refused to seek it when a police officer was killed in San Francisco in 2004 — an episode that drew protests at the time but that she has pointed to as an example of her commitment to a fairer criminal justice system. But 10 years later, when a judge declared California’s death penalty unconstitutional, she appealed the decision, saying she was obligated to do so as the state’s attorney general.
The criminal justice plan she released during her presidential campaign contained a number of progressive policies that she had opposed earlier in her career.
Senate Career
Elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris was the first Black woman in the chamber in more than a decade. During her relatively brief time as California’s junior senator, she has become known for her intensive interrogations of Trump administration officials and nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
In recent years, she sought to align herself more with the Democratic Party’s left wing, initially supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” bill before shifting her position during the presidential campaign. She has also backed proposals to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and revise the country’s bail system.
Harris has been a vocal supporter of racial justice legislation in response to the killing of Floyd, supporting proposals to overhaul policing and make lynching a federal crime.
She serves on several high-profile committees in the Senate, including the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
Presidential Campaign
Harris dropped out of the presidential race late last year after running low on money. She shot up in the polls after a strong first debate, but then fell and never really regained traction.
Yet when she entered the race in January, she was seen as one of the front-runners, and she had an impact on the early trajectory of the campaign.
Part of her influence was ideological: She was the first candidate, for instance, to suggest requiring federal preclearance for state abortion restrictions, a position that most of the Democratic candidates later expressed support for.
She had an electric moment in the first debate last June when she forcefully challenged Biden over his record on race. The way that exchange began was also notable: The moderators had not called on Harris, but she asserted herself by saying, “As the only Black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race.”
The interaction was an example of a quality that Harris’ campaign worked hard to play up, just as it played up her intense questioning in Senate hearings. Her team’s argument was that she could take control of any debate stage, including against President Donald Trump, and that she would not be intimidated by Trump’s bullying style of politics.
Broadly, however, she sometimes struggled to present a cohesive platform, most prominently on health care. In one well-publicized instance, she vacillated on whether enacting Medicare for All would mean eliminating private insurance.
Relationship with Biden
To many political observers, it might have seemed that the relationship between Harris and Biden was fraught. After all, in that first debate, Harris unleashed perhaps the most forceful — and memorable — attack on a rival of the entire primary campaign when she challenged Biden over his past opposition to busing as a means of integrating public schools.
It was “hurtful,” she said, to hear Biden speak positively about working with segregationist senators, because “there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day, and that little girl was me.”
Among some of Biden’s advisers, her debate-stage attack generated lingering resentment — even as recently as weeks ago. At a fundraiser in March, Jill Biden, the former second lady, called Harris’ debate stage remarks a “punch to the gut.”
But perhaps to stave off any doubts about their compatibility, Biden’s campaign immediately released a document on Tuesday about Harris that included a section on the “partnership” between the two politicians, noting that she had served as attorney general of California when Biden’s son Beau was attorney general of Delaware.
“The two grew close while fighting to take on the banking industry,” one bullet point read. “Through her friendship with Beau, she got to know Joe Biden.”
How voters may view her selection
During her presidential campaign, Harris appealed in particular to more moderate Democrats and those drawn to her biography. She could reinforce Biden’s appeal with Black women, suburban women and women generally who are eager to see themselves reflected in the country’s leadership.
Harris also has another potential secret weapon: her connection to the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, which she joined as an undergraduate at Howard University and whose roughly 300,000 members and multimillion-dollar budget could help provide fundraising and organizational might across the country.
But the progressive left, including some supporters of Sanders, will most likely be disappointed in Harris’ selection, viewing her as far more supportive of incremental change than the kind of broad, revolutionary proposals they champion. And her long career in law enforcement could be off-putting to some voters, especially younger voters, who are eager to see a police-reform movement with unqualified backing from the White House.

In selecting Sen. Kamala Harris of California to be his running mate, Joe Biden opted for a partner who has occupied a similar space in the center-left of the ideological spectrum — someone with whom he can most likely agree on many matters of policy.
Amid a field of more than 20 candidates in the Democratic primary, Biden and Harris were seen as relative moderates. During her own unsuccessful presidential campaign, Harris often resisted litmus tests posed within Democratic circles and at times struggled to clearly define her stance on fundamental issues like whether she would endorse a “Medicare for All” style of health insurance.
“I’m not trying to restructure society,” Harris said last summer in an interview with The New York Times. “I’m just trying to take care of the issues that wake people up in the middle of the night.”
In more recent months, since Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, the country has been rocked by the coronavirus pandemic as well as widespread unrest over police brutality and racial inequities. Both Biden and Harris have appeared to move further to the left — Biden seeking to bring together the Democratic Party and appeal to its progressive wing, and Harris emerging as a strong voice on racism and police misconduct.
Here is a look at where Harris stands on key policy issues.
Racial justice and policing
Harris, 55, will be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for vice president by a major party. She is a former prosecutor, and her handling of cases involving police shootings of civilians while she was California’s attorney general drew criticism from activists on the left, who argued that she was not aggressive enough in stepping in to overhaul rogue police departments and that she sided too frequently with police unions.
Harris has said she was trying to effect change from “inside” government. “When we want to reform systems, it shouldn’t and it can’t only be from the outside on bended knee or trying to break down the door,” she told The Times early in her campaign.
As a Democratic presidential candidate, Harris released plans outlining her vision for criminal justice reform and how to “stand up for Black America.” As part of the plans, Harris called for ending mass incarceration, cash bail and the death penalty; creating a national police systems review board; making attending historically Black colleges and universities debt-free for students; and many other measures.
Her stance on capital punishment in particular has drawn scrutiny. As San Francisco’s district attorney, Harris chose not to seek the death penalty in a major case on moral grounds, but as attorney general she appealed a judge’s decision declaring California’s death penalty law unconstitutional.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of her presidential campaign came during the first round of Democratic primary debates, when Harris confronted Biden about his fond recollections of working with segregationists in the Senate and then opened up about her personal history with school busing.
Biden, she said, had opposed school busing mandates to integrate schools in the 1970s, adding: “There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” (Harris joined the class in the third year of integration.)
In more recent months, since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Harris has spoken out strongly about the injustice faced by Black people in the United States. She introduced police accountability legislation known as the Justice in Policing Act this summer and sparred with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., after he blocked a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime.
Health care
During her presidential bid, Harris got tangled up by the issue of health care. She was not the only candidate to suffer that fate, but her stumbles were memorable.
In the Senate, Harris co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation, and at a CNN town hall event early in her campaign, she responded to a question about private health insurance by saying, “Let’s eliminate all of that.”
She came under fire for the statement, and the blowback was a signal of the political sensitivity surrounding the issue of abolishing private coverage under a single-payer system.
Then, on the debate stage, the Democratic candidates were asked who would abolish private health insurance. Harris was among those who raised their hands. But after the debate, she said she had misunderstood the question.
Biden — who wants to build on the Affordable Care Act — did not raise his hand in favor of eliminating private insurance.
Harris later put out her own health care plan, which placed her somewhere on the ideological spectrum between Biden and Sanders. Her plan sought to provide Medicare for all Americans, but it kept a significant role for health insurance companies by allowing people to choose private plans modeled on Medicare Advantage.
Regulating business
Harris’ relationship with Wall Street and Silicon Valley also highlights her reputation as a centrist.
After the 2008 financial crisis, she pulled California out of a national settlement with big banks, leveraging her power as attorney general to wrest more money from major mortgage lenders. She later announced that California homeowners would receive $12 billion in mortgage relief under the settlement.
Yet critics on the left said she had not done enough to clamp down on miscreant lenders or to regulate the technology industry, citing her close ties to Silicon Valley. One sticking point during her Senate career was her late endorsement of SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made websites accountable for aiding sex trafficking.
“Time and again, we ran into her running interference for Silicon Valley,” said Jamie Court, president of the California-based organization Consumer Watchdog.
On another issue — autonomous vehicles — Harris threatened Uber with legal action in 2016 if the company didn’t remove driverless cars from the California roads. But once she was in Washington, consumer activists criticized her for failing to oppose legislation that would have overridden tough California rules on autonomous vehicles.
More recently, like Biden, she has called for an increase in corporate taxes.
Education, gun control, abortion and other issues
Harris was not known as the “plans” candidate in the primary — another presidential contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, earned that label — but like her rivals, she put forth several policy ideas.
Taking aim at the teacher pay gap, she proposed giving teachers pay raises averaging $13,500.
Harris also committed to using her executive power to put in place an array of gun control measures like mandatory background checks and more stringent regulation of gun manufacturers. She also promised to work to close a loophole that allows some domestic abusers to buy guns under certain conditions.
She argued that states and localities with a history of unconstitutionally restricting abortion rights should have to obtain federal approval before new abortion laws can take effect. And she proposed closing the gender wage gap by requiring larger companies to certify that men and women are paid equally.
On climate, Harris teamed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to propose legislation that would establish an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability and rate environmental laws and rules based on their impact on low-income communities.
Before kicking off her campaign, Harris also introduced legislation to provide a tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and working-class families.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California, whom Joe Biden chose on Tuesday as his running mate, will be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party. A pragmatic moderate and one of Biden’s former rivals in the presidential race, Harris was a barrier-breaking prosecutor before being elected to the Senate in 2016.
Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California. She is a former attorney general of California and a former San Francisco district attorney.
When she announced her own bid for the presidency — on Martin Luther King’s Birthday in 2019 — she pitched herself as a history-making candidate, paying homage to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.
Prosecutorial Background
Harris’ record as a prosecutor — she was the San Francisco district attorney from 2004 to 2011, and the California attorney general from 2011 to 2017 — was a major theme of her presidential campaign and will almost certainly be discussed in the general election, especially given the national outcry over police brutality and systemic racism since the killing of George Floyd.
Harris has described herself as a “progressive prosecutor” and argued that it is possible to be tough on crime while also confronting the deep inequities of the criminal justice system. She has said she became a prosecutor because she believed she could best change the system from within, a message that became a key part of her pitch as a presidential candidate: that voters could trust her to overhaul the justice system because she knew it “from the inside out.”
But aspects of her record have been a source of criticism, especially from the left.
As attorney general, she rarely prosecuted police officers who killed civilians, though by the time she left that office, she had opened some reviews of police departments. She was also criticized for refusing to allow advanced DNA testing that might have exonerated Kevin Cooper, a Black man on death row, and for defending some convictions against allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.
An opponent of the death penalty, she refused to seek it when a police officer was killed in San Francisco in 2004 — an episode that drew protests at the time but that she has pointed to as an example of her commitment to a fairer criminal justice system. But 10 years later, when a judge declared California’s death penalty unconstitutional, she appealed the decision, saying she was obligated to do so as the state’s attorney general.
The criminal justice plan she released during her presidential campaign contained a number of progressive policies that she had opposed earlier in her career.
Senate Career
Elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris was the first Black woman in the chamber in more than a decade. During her relatively brief time as California’s junior senator, she has become known for her intensive interrogations of Trump administration officials and nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
In recent years, she sought to align herself more with the Democratic Party’s left wing, initially supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” bill before shifting her position during the presidential campaign. She has also backed proposals to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and revise the country’s bail system.
Harris has been a vocal supporter of racial justice legislation in response to the killing of Floyd, supporting proposals to overhaul policing and make lynching a federal crime.
She serves on several high-profile committees in the Senate, including the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee.
Presidential Campaign
Harris dropped out of the presidential race late last year after running low on money. She shot up in the polls after a strong first debate, but then fell and never really regained traction.
Yet when she entered the race in January, she was seen as one of the front-runners, and she had an impact on the early trajectory of the campaign.
Part of her influence was ideological: She was the first candidate, for instance, to suggest requiring federal preclearance for state abortion restrictions, a position that most of the Democratic candidates later expressed support for.
She had an electric moment in the first debate last June when she forcefully challenged Biden over his record on race. The way that exchange began was also notable: The moderators had not called on Harris, but she asserted herself by saying, “As the only Black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race.”
The interaction was an example of a quality that Harris’ campaign worked hard to play up, just as it played up her intense questioning in Senate hearings. Her team’s argument was that she could take control of any debate stage, including against President Donald Trump, and that she would not be intimidated by Trump’s bullying style of politics.
Broadly, however, she sometimes struggled to present a cohesive platform, most prominently on health care. In one well-publicized instance, she vacillated on whether enacting Medicare for All would mean eliminating private insurance.
Relationship with Biden
To many political observers, it might have seemed that the relationship between Harris and Biden was fraught. After all, in that first debate, Harris unleashed perhaps the most forceful — and memorable — attack on a rival of the entire primary campaign when she challenged Biden over his past opposition to busing as a means of integrating public schools.
It was “hurtful,” she said, to hear Biden speak positively about working with segregationist senators, because “there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day, and that little girl was me.”
Among some of Biden’s advisers, her debate-stage attack generated lingering resentment — even as recently as weeks ago. At a fundraiser in March, Jill Biden, the former second lady, called Harris’ debate stage remarks a “punch to the gut.”
But perhaps to stave off any doubts about their compatibility, Biden’s campaign immediately released a document on Tuesday about Harris that included a section on the “partnership” between the two politicians, noting that she had served as attorney general of California when Biden’s son Beau was attorney general of Delaware.
“The two grew close while fighting to take on the banking industry,” one bullet point read. “Through her friendship with Beau, she got to know Joe Biden.”
How voters may view her selection
During her presidential campaign, Harris appealed in particular to more moderate Democrats and those drawn to her biography. She could reinforce Biden’s appeal with Black women, suburban women and women generally who are eager to see themselves reflected in the country’s leadership.
Harris also has another potential secret weapon: her connection to the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, which she joined as an undergraduate at Howard University and whose roughly 300,000 members and multimillion-dollar budget could help provide fundraising and organizational might across the country.
But the progressive left, including some supporters of Sanders, will most likely be disappointed in Harris’ selection, viewing her as far more supportive of incremental change than the kind of broad, revolutionary proposals they champion. And her long career in law enforcement could be off-putting to some voters, especially younger voters, who are eager to see a police-reform movement with unqualified backing from the White House.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California will be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for national office by a major party. A pragmatic moderate and one of Joe Biden’s former rivals in the presidential race, Harris was a barrier-breaking prosecutor before being elected to the Senate in 2016.
Harris, 55, was born in Oakland, California. She is a former attorney general of California and a former San Francisco district attorney.
When she announced her own bid for the presidency — on Martin Luther King’s Birthday in 2019 — she pitched herself as a history-making candidate, paying homage to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.
Prosecutorial Background
Before she was a senator, Harris was a prosecutor, elected as the San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and as California’s attorney general in 2010. She held that position until she won her Senate seat in 2016.
Harris made this part of her career a major theme of her presidential campaign, describing herself as a “progressive prosecutor” and arguing that it was possible to be tough on crime while also confronting the deep inequities of the criminal justice system. Part of her argument was that voters could trust her to overhaul the system because she knew it “from the inside out.” But some parts of her record were a source of criticism from the left.
Her prosecutorial record will almost certainly be raised in the general election, especially amid the national outcry over police brutality and systemic racism that has followed the killing of George Floyd.
Senate Career
Elected to the Senate in 2016, Harris was the first Black woman in the chamber in more than a decade. During her relatively brief time as California’s junior senator, she has become known for her intensive interrogations of Trump administration officials and nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
In recent years, she had sought to align herself more with the Democratic Party’s left wing, initially supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare for All” bill before shifting her position during the presidential campaign. She has also been a vocal supporter of racial justice legislation since the killing of Floyd.

While Harris dropped out of the presidential race late last year after running low on money, she entered as one of the front-runners and had a significant impact on the trajectory of the campaign.
Part of her influence was ideological: She was the first candidate, for instance, to suggest requiring federal preclearance for state abortion restrictions, a position that numerous top candidates later expressed support for. And part of it stemmed from her debate performances, including an electric moment in the first debate.
On the stage in June, she forcefully challenged Biden over his record on race and, specifically, busing.

In selecting Sen. Kamala Harris of California to be his running mate, Joe Biden opted for a partner who has occupied a similar space in the center-left of the ideological spectrum — someone with whom he can most likely agree on many matters of policy.
Amid a field of more than 20 candidates in the Democratic primary, Biden and Harris were seen as relative moderates. During her own unsuccessful presidential campaign, Harris often resisted litmus tests posed within Democratic circles and at times struggled to clearly define her stance on fundamental issues like whether she would endorse a “Medicare for All” style of health insurance.
“I’m not trying to restructure society,” Harris said last summer in an interview with The New York Times. “I’m just trying to take care of the issues that wake people up in the middle of the night.”
In more recent months, since Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, the country has been rocked by the coronavirus pandemic as well as widespread unrest over police brutality and racial inequities. Both Biden and Harris have appeared to move further to the left — Biden seeking to bring together the Democratic Party and appeal to its progressive wing, and Harris emerging as a strong voice on racism and police misconduct.
Here is a look at where Harris stands on key policy issues.
Racial justice and policing
Harris, 55, will be the first Black woman and the first person of Indian descent to be nominated for vice president by a major party. She is a former prosecutor, and her handling of cases involving police shootings of civilians while she was California’s attorney general drew criticism from activists on the left, who argued that she was not aggressive enough in stepping in to overhaul rogue police departments and that she sided too frequently with police unions.
Harris has said she was trying to effect change from “inside” government. “When we want to reform systems, it shouldn’t and it can’t only be from the outside on bended knee or trying to break down the door,” she told The Times early in her campaign.
As a Democratic presidential candidate, Harris released plans outlining her vision for criminal justice reform and how to “stand up for Black America.” As part of the plans, Harris called for ending mass incarceration, cash bail and the death penalty; creating a national police systems review board; making attending historically Black colleges and universities debt-free for students; and many other measures.
Her stance on capital punishment in particular has drawn scrutiny. As San Francisco’s district attorney, Harris chose not to seek the death penalty in a major case on moral grounds, but as attorney general she appealed a judge’s decision declaring California’s death penalty law unconstitutional.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of her presidential campaign came during the first round of Democratic primary debates, when Harris confronted Biden about his fond recollections of working with segregationists in the Senate and then opened up about her personal history with school busing.
Biden, she said, had opposed school busing mandates to integrate schools in the 1970s, adding: “There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” (Harris joined the class in the third year of integration.)
In more recent months, since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Harris has spoken out strongly about the injustice faced by Black people in the United States. She introduced police accountability legislation known as the Justice in Policing Act this summer and sparred with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., after he blocked a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime.
Health care
During her presidential bid, Harris got tangled up by the issue of health care. She was not the only candidate to suffer that fate, but her stumbles were memorable.
In the Senate, Harris co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation, and at a CNN town hall event early in her campaign, she responded to a question about private health insurance by saying, “Let’s eliminate all of that.”
She came under fire for the statement, and the blowback was a signal of the political sensitivity surrounding the issue of abolishing private coverage under a single-payer system.
Then, on the debate stage, the Democratic candidates were asked who would abolish private health insurance. Harris was among those who raised their hands. But after the debate, she said she had misunderstood the question.
Biden — who wants to build on the Affordable Care Act — did not raise his hand in favor of eliminating private insurance.
Harris later put out her own health care plan, which placed her somewhere on the ideological spectrum between Biden and Sanders. Her plan sought to provide Medicare for all Americans, but it kept a significant role for health insurance companies by allowing people to choose private plans modeled on Medicare Advantage.
Regulating business
Harris’ relationship with Wall Street and Silicon Valley also highlights her reputation as a centrist.
After the 2008 financial crisis, she pulled California out of a national settlement with big banks, leveraging her power as attorney general to wrest more money from major mortgage lenders. She later announced that California homeowners would receive $12 billion in mortgage relief under the settlement.
Yet critics on the left said she had not done enough to clamp down on miscreant lenders or to regulate the technology industry, citing her close ties to Silicon Valley. One sticking point during her Senate career was her late endorsement of SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made websites accountable for aiding sex trafficking.
“Time and again, we ran into her running interference for Silicon Valley,” said Jamie Court, president of the California-based organization Consumer Watchdog.
On another issue — autonomous vehicles — Harris threatened Uber with legal action in 2016 if the company didn’t remove driverless cars from the California roads. But once she was in Washington, consumer activists criticized her for failing to oppose legislation that would have overridden tough California rules on autonomous vehicles.
More recently, like Biden, she has called for an increase in corporate taxes.
Education, gun control, abortion and other issues
Harris was not known as the “plans” candidate in the primary — another presidential contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, earned that label — but like her rivals, she put forth several policy ideas.
Taking aim at the teacher pay gap, she proposed giving teachers pay raises averaging $13,500.
Harris also committed to using her executive power to put in place an array of gun control measures like mandatory background checks and more stringent regulation of gun manufacturers. She also promised to work to close a loophole that allows some domestic abusers to buy guns under certain conditions.
She argued that states and localities with a history of unconstitutionally restricting abortion rights should have to obtain federal approval before new abortion laws can take effect. And she proposed closing the gender wage gap by requiring larger companies to certify that men and women are paid equally.
On climate, Harris teamed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to propose legislation that would establish an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability and rate environmental laws and rules based on their impact on low-income communities.
Before kicking off her campaign, Harris also introduced legislation to provide a tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and working-class families.

Amid waves of civil unrest as protesters across the country continue to demonstrate against police brutality, Americans’ confidence in the police has dropped to a record low, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.
The survey, conducted by Gallup from early June to mid-July, found that confidence in the police had fallen 5 points, to 48%, from the year before. Gallup, which started tracking the public’s confidence in a range of public institutions in 1973 during the Watergate scandal, adding the police in 1993, said this was the “first time in the 27-year trend that this reading is below the majority.”
But despite the overall decline, the survey found that Republicans’ confidence in the police had risen 7 points, to 82%. Democrats’ faith in law enforcement dropped 6 points, to 28%.
Gallup conducted telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,226 adults for the poll. The margin of sampling error for a sample of this size is plus or minus 4 percentage points, according to Gallup, meaning that differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.
The drop in confidence came after George Floyd, a Black man, was killed in Minneapolis police custody at the end of May, inspiring weeks of civil unrest nationwide. Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” echoed those of Eric Garner, a Black man who died after being put in a chokehold by a police officer on Staten Island in 2014.
Black people are far more likely than whites and other groups to be the victims of use of force by the police, even when racial disparities in crime are taken into account. A New York Times report found that at least 70 people over the past decade, ranging in age from 19 to 65, had died in law enforcement custody after saying the same words: “I can’t breathe.” A majority of them had been stopped or held over nonviolent infractions, 911 calls about suspicious behavior, or concerns about their mental health. More than half were Black.
The Gallup survey also found that the gap between white and Black Americans’ expressed confidence in the police has never been greater, said Mohamed Younis, Gallup’s editor-in-chief.
The survey found that 56% of white adults said they were confident in the police, whereas only 19% of Black adults said the same. That 37-point gap is larger than it has been historically, according to Gallup, which also found a divide in Americans’ trust in the criminal justice system.
“One of the starkest metrics in this year’s poll is that 11% of Black Americans express confidence in the criminal justice system,” Younis said. “That means nine out of 10 Black Americans in this country do not have confidence in a process built on the theory that all citizens are equal before the law.”
That’s compared with 24% of white Americans, according to Gallup’s poll results.
Gallup said that from 1993 until “the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013” — after the acquittal of the man who fatally shot the Black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin — “about 25 points separated Black and white adults’ ratings of confidence in the police.”
But from 2014 through 2019, “Black Americans’ confidence in police dipped 6 points, to an average of 30%, while white Americans’ confidence was steady at 60%, increasing the racial gap to 30 points.”
The downward trend is not a surprise “if you’ve been watching the news,” said Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder and chief executive of the Center for Policing Equity, and a professor of African American studies and psychology at Yale.
Goff said that the racial gap in trust in the police could be attributed to the “kind of law enforcement people from different racial groups tend to receive in this country,” and that “none of these things are mysteries. It is exactly for the reasons that you think it is.”
But what Goff found most noteworthy is that now a majority does not have confidence in law enforcement.
That’s “unprecedented in this country,” he said, and it creates a problem for public safety because compliance with the law “begins with trust in it, and not fear of it.”
It remains to be seen if this year is “merely a low point for this institution or if confidence in police will continue to suffer beyond 2020,” Younis said, but he noted that “despite a downtick this year, police are among the most highly regarded institutions Gallup has polled on — even in this year’s poll.”
“They have also maintained majority confidence in all of our polls except the latest one — which comes during a year when police, as an institution, have been under a microscope,” he said.
Younis pointed to other Gallup Polls showing that although “most Americans want some kind of policing reform, they also want their local police to maintain or increase the amount of time they spend in their local neighborhoods.”
Goff said the police do have opportunities to improve, “and it’s not a deep scientific trick: Do better.”
Pointing to a Center for Policing Equity document called “A Roadmap for Exploring New Models of Funding Public Safety,” Goff said there were steps that cities and the police could take immediately that would lead to an increase in trust.
“If your community is not in charge of the kind of public safety it’s getting, fix that,” he said, also explaining that officials need to be transparent with communities, including about what law enforcement can and cannot do.
Ensuring that there are enough resources for community issues, including mental health, substance abuse and homelessness, is also key.
The police, Goff said, “know that they can be trained to be effective in protecting people from the violence of street crime, but they can never be effective at protecting people from the violence of poverty.”

From the moment Bernie Sanders exited the presidential race in early April, many activists, organizers, progressive groups and elected officials had held out hope that Joe Biden would elevate one of their ideological allies to the vice presidency — someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Rep. Karen Bass of California. Kamala Harris, an establishment-friendly senator from California and more of a moderate, was near the bottom of their list.
So when Biden announced Tuesday that he had selected Harris as his running mate, his choice reaffirmed what many progressives had long feared: that any potential Biden administration would govern as the former vice president had spent most of his career — firmly rooted in Democratic establishment politics.
But rather than revolt, many progressive activists and elected officials immediately snuffed out their criticisms and instead proclaimed their support, applauding the selection and reiterating that removing President Donald Trump from office was their electoral priority. Even those prone to denouncing Biden and other moderates largely tried to make peace.
“At the end of the day, this isn’t some democratic decision,” said Evan Weber, the political director for the Sunrise Movement, the climate advocacy group, which endorsed Sanders in the primary. “This was always going to be a decision that was up to the vice president and a personal one of his.”
Larry Cohen, the chairman of the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution, described Harris as “extremely competent.”
“She’s not Warren or Bass in terms of her background, but I don’t think it makes sense for us to criticize the reality,” he said.
The public declarations of enthusiasm for Harris underscore how delicately progressives are approaching this moment, as they try to balance their demands for change with the understanding that Democrats across the spectrum must remain united behind Biden to defeat Trump. They are also negotiating another political reality: that Harris could be the party’s face of the future, and crossing her now will have political consequences that did not exist at the week’s outset.
Unlike Biden, who became vice president after decades of establishing himself as a Washington moderate with a talent for wheeling and dealing, Harris remains somewhat ideologically undefined. In treading lightly, some progressives are hoping that it allows them to make inroads in her circle of influence and create openings that may not exist with Biden.
“I don’t know that the left is more excited by the Harris-Biden ticket than they would’ve been otherwise,” Weber said. “But it’s clear that she’s to the left of Biden and she’s been more accountable to movements throughout her career.”
Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union and a Sanders ally, said she was focusing on how Harris, as California attorney general, had helped secure a nationwide settlement with big banks.
“When I think about this moment that we’re in, and I think about the fact that she was one of the AGs to take on the banks during the financial crisis and to stand up for working people — I’m hanging on to that right now,” she said. “I can get excited about that.”
But while many groups and officials tended to toe the party line, others spoke more cautiously of their support. Cori Bush, a progressive activist who will almost certainly head to Congress after unseating a House member in a Democratic primary this month in St. Louis, said she was “torn” about the selection of Harris.
“I’m not going to tear down another woman of color,” Bush said. “But as a progressive, I have to stand with my progressive values.”
Bush acknowledged the magnitude of the moment, especially for older Black women who were excited to see — and vote for — another Black woman on a national ticket. But she also said that Harris’ rise to prominence discounted some historically marginalized communities.
“I applaud her for the way that she has evolved, but people were hurt while she was figuring out how to evolve,” she said, referring to Harris’ oversight of the criminal justice system in California. “And we cannot forget that those people matter. I stand with them and want them to know I will represent them as hard as I can.”
In the months since Sanders dropped out of the race, effectively making Biden the nominee and starting the clock for the vice-presidential selection, progressives have had a string of victories further down the ballot. Challengers backed by groups like Sunrise and Justice Democrats won in New York and Illinois, including in some races against prominent House incumbents. Each member of the so-called Squad, the group of progressive women of color in the House who have at times rankled House leadership, secured reelection with comfortable margins.
The biggest victory came in St. Louis, when Bush unseated a longtime congressman, Rep. William Lacy Clay, and provided a new playbook for how to appeal to Black voters with the progressive platform.
The growing grassroots power of these progressives, if sustained, could set up a clash with Biden and Harris, who have a shared instinct for political caution. During the primary campaign both were targeted relentlessly by the progressive left but rarely budged. Biden tailored his message to focus on how he could defeat Trump, sidelining policy as a focus. Harris moved in the opposition direction, rejecting “Medicare for All” after initially co-sponsoring Sanders’ bill on the health care plan.
This leftward shift could change the dynamics in Washington, said Mondaire Jones, a lawyer who won the primary in New York’s 17th Congressional District and is most likely headed to Capitol Hill in the fall. Jones praised Harris’ selection as historic, but suggested that liberals would continue to press their agenda.
“The left in recent years has never shied away from a fight with members of the Democratic Party, and I see no reason why we won’t flex our newfound muscle in a Biden-Harris administration,” Jones said.
“Biden and Harris would be working with the most progressive Congress we’ve seen,” he said. “And I’m ready to make sure they’re sticking to their promises and will be part of the effort to push them to be more in line with progressive values.”
Among liberals, the acceptance of Harris, if reluctant, still amounted to a surprising about-face after months of lobbying for her more progressive rivals to appear on the ticket.
In urging Biden to name Warren as his running mate, liberals pointed to her policy plans on issues like student debt and her readiness to lead the country should she have to step in — one of the central criteria Biden had laid out during his search.
Warren, for her part, had publicly signaled her interest in the No. 2 job, answering an emphatic “yes” when Rachel Maddow asked her on MSNBC in April if she’d accept the offer from Biden.
But after George Floyd’s killing by the police in late May intensified calls for racial justice across the country, some Democrats began more forcefully pressing Biden to put a Black woman on the ticket, and Warren’s prospects seemed to dim. Though some progressives continued to lobby for Warren, many also began publicly pushing Biden to select Bass, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, who had a long history of espousing progressive policies.
Then revelations that Bass had spoken favorably about Fidel Castro brought a swift backlash against her, particularly from Florida Democrats who argued that her past positions were particularly offensive to older Cubans with memories of the Cold War.
During the primary campaign and even before Harris entered the race, the progressive wing had expressed particular concern about her ties to big donors and aspects of her record as a prosecutor.
In her interview, Bush said she was open to speaking to Harris and building a relationship with her.
Asked if she was worried that criticizing Harris would put off her future Democratic colleagues in Washington, Bush rejected the idea outright.
“Not at all,” she said, adding that her commitment to removing Trump from office could not quash her advocacy. “Cori is going to be Cori, and my experiences are my experiences.”

Halliestine Zimmerman, a 71-year-old retired accountant in Mauldin, South Carolina, has voted in every election since she was 18, having watched her mother work to get more African Americans to vote in the 1940s and ’50s.
“We are just benefiting from that — from our mothers,” she said Wednesday, the morning after Kamala Harris was chosen as the first woman of color to run on a national presidential ticket. “It is amazing what I have seen in my lifetime.”
For Zimmerman, there was joy in the moment, in being able to point to Harris as a role model, one whom her grandchildren could see themselves in. But there was also pain in remembering the past.
Soon after Zimmerman graduated from South Carolina State University in Orangeburg in 1971, she went to a department store in Columbia, South Carolina, to shop for a professional wardrobe — she was about to become the first African American to work at the local IRS outpost. But when Zimmerman applied for a credit card, the saleswoman apologetically explained, “We just don’t give credit to women.”
“There was a time when nobody thought this was possible,” she said, of Harris as the vice-presidential pick. “It was time for the Democrats to recognize who brought them to victory and who brings them to victory every time — it is Black women.”
“Finally,” she added, “they are letting us know they hear us.”
That sense of jubilant vindication is just what a group of activists and strategists imagined hearing when they began a campaign that they hoped would make it impossible for Joe Biden to choose anyone but a Black woman as his running mate.
They weren’t sure it would work, but they knew why they wanted to try.
In March, Biden pledged to select a woman as his No. 2 on the ticket. In late April, a group of dozens of Black female activists and strategists, including Minyon Moore and Karen Finney, both longtime Hillary Clinton strategists, and Leah D. Daughtry, a minister and Democratic operative, made a pact: They would demand — publicly, without ambiguity or apologetics — that Biden choose a Black woman.
As longtime leaders in the Democratic Party, they said they often felt overlooked and taken for granted. In the century since the fight for suffrage won the ratification of the 19th Amendment, they said, the “women’s vote” had often seemed to function as a coded shorthand for the “white women’s vote.”
Aimee Allison, the director of She the People, which advocates women of color getting involved in politics, remembered feeling angry in 2016 as she watched Clinton embrace the all-white clothing of suffragists. How, she wondered, could the first female U.S. presidential nominee not be aware of the fact that those suffragists had pushed Black women aside?
For Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland, California, who was a chair for Harris’ presidential campaign, frustrations over the years came from hearing conversations about equal pay that did not acknowledge that Black and Latina women earned significantly less than white women. “There has been a quantum leap this year,” Lee said in an interview. “Now we see the many reasons for the respect and importance of African American women leading.”
On Wednesday, Biden made reference to some of those reasons.
“This morning all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little Black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities,” he said, in his first public appearance as running mates with Harris. “But today — just maybe — they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents.”
The selection of Harris represents at least a handful of firsts on a national presidential ticket: the first Black woman, the first Indian American woman, the first daughter of immigrants, the first graduate of a historically Black college, the first member of an African American sorority.
Those firsts — wonder at the sheer fact of them — came up repeatedly in the reactions of women like Debi Wood, a retired lawyer and a graduate of the law school at Howard University in Washington, D.C., Harris’ alma mater.
“We were always taught that we are change agents and we must go out into the world,” Wood said. “Take our education from Howard and do something to change the United States and change how society views and treats and embraces the Black community but really people of color in general.”
India Bland, 20, from Los Angeles, will cast her first vote in a presidential election this fall, and she is glad she has the choice to vote for a first. “I would presume that a lot of young, African American voters like myself want to see someone who looks like them in these areas of power,” she said. Though, she added, “Our support just can’t be, ‘It’s great that she’s the first.’”
Representation isn’t straightforward of course, and no group is a monolith. Some women, like Rhonda Y. Gans, a physician in Chicago, sees Harris as the “Wonder Woman of the people,” and other Black women voters are approaching the choice with caution. Polls have shown that Black voters themselves were not tied to the idea of Biden choosing a Black running mate. Younger Black voters say they are more concerned about some of the policies that Harris supports.
Vanessa Payne, 19, a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, said she was “disappointed at first,” that Biden did not choose a more liberal running mate. “But then I realized that some progress is better than no progress,” Payne said. “All I can do is support her now and hope that whatever she decides to do is for the best.”
The Black women with decades of experience in politics who pushed for this moment know that this milestone for a woman of color in politics is complex.
Even before Harris’ selection, the same activists who organized the push were readying themselves for the particular brand of racist and sexist attacks likely to be aimed at a Black woman on the presidential ticket. And within hours of the announcement, they saw examples of what they had been worried about. The Wikipedia page for Harris was edited to change her name with an offensive reference to female anatomy. From the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly called her “nasty” and “disrespectful.”
“It is going to be a long road to the White House,” said Moya Bailey, a professor in the department of cultures, societies and global studies at Northeastern University in Boston who coined the term misogynoir, referring to the way Black women experience both sexism and racism. “I do think that the way our country has shown its disregard for Black women will definitely come up in the weeks and months ahead.”
In March, Biden said he would pick a woman and in August he put Harris on the ticket, unleashing moments of both real celebration and real concern for the group of activists who worked for this milestone.
Donna Brazile wasn’t initially sure she wanted to be part of the group to publicly push Biden to reach this moment.
When Brazile, who managed Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign, was asked to sign the letter, she initially hesitated. Would it box Biden in? What if their demand was rejected?
“I went to bed — I prayed on it,” she said. “I don’t know if it was Shirley Chisholm in my dreams, but I woke up thinking: Oh, hell yeah, put my name on the list.”

After Agnes Chow Is Arrested in Hong Kong, a ‘Mulan’ Meme Is Born

HONG KONG — Soon after one of Hong Kong’s best-known democracy activists was arrested this week under the national security law imposed on the city by the Chinese government, supporters turned her into a “Mulan” meme.
The social media storm around the activist, Agnes Chow, coincided with Disney’s online campaign for its upcoming movie “Mulan,” about the Chinese folk heroine who disguises herself as a man to stand in for her ailing father in the army. Disney’s slogan: “The legend arrives.”
Supporters on Twitter quickly anointed Chow, 23, “the real Mulan.” One meme featured three images, each accompanied by text: the “Mulan” star Liu Yifei (“I want the real Mulan”); the cartoon version of Mulan from Disney’s animated 1998 film (“I said the real Mulan“); and Chow (“Perfection”).
The dueling campaigns illustrated the power of rapid-fire memes to serve as a howl of virtual protest: Chow’s name, along with #Mulan, has been trending for days. They also merged Hollywood fantasy with 21st-century geopolitics and ancient Chinese folklore.
They come at a fraught moment for Hong Kong, as activists and others lament a loss of freedom under the security law imposed six weeks ago, and as tensions deepen between China and Western nations over the fate of the semiautonomous territory.
Chow, a former leader of the now-disbanded pro-democracy group Demosisto, was among 10 people arrested Monday on suspicion of violating the security law. She was detained hours after 200 police officers converged on the newsroom of Apple Daily, a publication owned by media mogul Jimmy Lai, who is a vocal critic of the Chinese government. He, his two sons and other executives from his company were arrested.
Chow has not been formally charged, and she was released on bail. People convicted under the security law could be jailed for life.
“Of the four times I’ve been arrested, this is the most terrifying,” she wrote shortly after her release.
Chow rose to prominence as a student activist in 2012 and as a protest leader during the Umbrella Movement of 2014, becoming one of the few female faces of Hong Kong’s youth-led pro-democracy movement at the time. Chow was recently charged in connection with an anti-government protest outside Police Headquarters last year. But she has said she does not understand why she was arrested this week under the security law, which is not retroactive.
The large protests that erupted last year in Hong Kong had been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic even before China imposed the security law, which carries much harsher potential penalties for anti-government street protests. So supports have relied in part on online platforms to shore up the movement and connect with others internationally.
Disney’s “Mulan,” for its part, has been at the center of an ideological divide in Hong Kong since last year.
Liu, the Chinese actress who plays Mulan in the movie, drew a backlash in August 2019 when she sided with the Hong Kong police against the protesters on the microblogging platform Weibo, where she had nearly 66 million followers at the time. The police have been accused of excessive force in dealing with the protests.
When Liu shared the quote “I support the Hong Kong police, you all can beat me up now,” adding a heart and a bicep emoji, the blowback was swift, with supporters of the protests calling for a boycott of “Mulan.” On Monday, after Chow’s arrest, some social media users revived the criticism of Liu.
“#LiuYifei is a selfish #CCP shill who supports #PoliceBrutality in #HongKong,” one viral tweet read. “#AgnesChow has given everything to #FightForFreedom and defend her people.” Referring to a slogan from the movie, it added, “So who is really loyal brave and true?”
Neither Liu nor Disney could be immediately reached for comment.
Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong has a tiny domestic market with limited commercial clout. But the city’s internet users have become a voice to be reckoned with, using savvy and aggressive online campaigns to raise awareness about the city’s political crisis.
The release date for “Mulan,” initially set for March, has been pushed back to September because of the pandemic. Disney says it has been approved for theatrical release in China.

Coco Gauff Was Rising When Tennis Stopped. Now She Might Be Even Better.

Before it all stopped, no tennis talent was on a steeper climb than Coco Gauff was.
Ranked 686th in women’s singles at the start of 2019, Gauff proceeded to crack the Top 50, win her first WTA title, and make impressive runs at three Grand Slam events, all before turning 16 years old.
Then came the abrupt halting of the tennis tours, and so many other parts of American society, in March.
“Obviously I missed competing and I missed playing, but I think it was a good little break for me because I was able to train,” Gauff said. “I always consider myself still in the development stage, so having those months off to work on certain stuff definitely helped.”
Gauff, now ranked 53rd, returned to competition for the first time since January this week in Lexington, Kentucky, at the new Top Seed Open, a WTA tournament that has attracted past Grand Slam champions like Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Venus Williams and Sloane Stephens. Gauff advanced to Friday’s quarterfinal by beating Aryna Sabalenka, the No. 11 WTA singles player and second-seeded player in the tournament, in three sets Wednesday.
The data on Gauff is limited, but the small sample sparkles. In the three Grand Slam main draws in which she has played, Gauff twice beat Venus Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, en route to reaching the fourth round. She lost to the eventual champion at those events twice — Simona Halep at Wimbledon last year and Sofia Kenin at the Australian Open this year — and the other was against a defending champion — Naomi Osaka at the 2019 United States Open, a loss she avenged in January at the Australian Open.
Though she has had time to work on aspects of her game like moving forward, returns and her second serve, the sudden stalling of the tour could be a challenge for a player who has not yet reached the expected pinnacle of her ascent.
“For me, what’s going to happen now will make the difference between players who are just on a roll because they’ve been winning a lot in the previous months and the ones who really are going to be great,” said Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams’ coach who runs an academy in southern France where Gauff has trained.
Mouratoglou believes younger players seeking to climb the rankings might have had an easier time staying eager and invested during the uncertainty, and several top players echoed his sentiments.
Serena Williams, 38, who is seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title, said her mindset would have been far different had such a disruption happened before she had achieved her first breakthrough.
“Oh my gosh, when I was looking for my first major I would be like, crazy,” Williams said. “I would be like, ‘Wow this is so intense, this is so crazy.’ But it’s different; I have everything I can want.”
Azarenka, 31, who lost in the first round at Lexington to Venus Williams, traveled to Kentucky without her young son, Leo. She said that a young player with fewer outside interests might be able to better handle the isolation of playing on a tour during the pandemic.
“For me, it was only tennis when I was Coco’s age,” Azarenka said. “I didn’t have any other interest in doing something else, staying home and being a parent instead of going to Lexington to sit in a hotel room all the time. It takes a little bit more — I would say personally at this stage — sacrifice and mental sacrifice than before, or at least from my experience.”
“But if I was 17, I wouldn’t care,” Azarenka added. “I would just go, ‘OK, well, I’m just going to go and play tennis.’”
But Gauff was not solely focused on tennis during the shutdown, as she spoke out during the national conversations on racism and police violence this spring and summer. At a protest in June, Gauff addressed a crowd outside City Hall in her hometown Delray Beach, Florida, speaking compellingly and confidently without prepared remarks.
“It was definitely from the heart,” she said, “and I think that when you speak from the heart, you get the message that you want.”
Gauff said Sunday that she had been asked “maybe two minutes before” to address the crowd, but she did not shrink from the occasion. Gauff’s poise, which has wowed so many in tennis over the past 13 months, has run in the family.
“Why I felt calm was because of my grandmother,” Gauff said. “She taught me a lot over the years.”
Gauff’s maternal grandmother, Yvonne Lee Odom, integrated Seacrest High School in Delray Beach in 1961, becoming the school’s first Black student as a 15-year-old.
“I learned a lot about her stories over the years,” Gauff said of her grandmother, who spoke at the protest right before her granddaughter did. “That kind of prepared me for that moment. I also felt responsible since I do have a big platform; it would be wrong of me to stay silent when this is an issue going on.”
Gauff has also acted in less public ways, like sending emails to the Louisville Police Department seeking justice in the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician killed by officers in March.
In June, Gauff pivoted mid-tweet in one of her several posts about the case:
“I AM SO HAPPY tennis is coming back! I am glad to say I will be playing the- Now that I have your attention Breonna Taylor still hasn’t received justice for her wrongful death.”
“Hopefully it can happen,” Gauff said Sunday. “We just continue to demand justice for her and continue to peacefully protest. Hopefully we’ll see some change.”
By contrast, Gauff has a less results-oriented mindset on the court.
Her father and coach, Corey Gauff, said the main thing missing from her development during the pandemic was tournament play. Because of closures around Delray Beach, the Gauffs practiced on courts in their neighborhood that they had never previously used.
They also experimented with equipment and adjusted technique because Coco Gauff is still growing physically, her father said, meaning she has been able to add more spin and variety to her shots.
“She’s got a lot more weapons than she did before, and she’s improved some other weapons she’s got,” he said. “Now she’s got to learn how to put all that together, and we’ll see how it plays out in matches.”
Gauff shares her father’s optimism about the pause.
“I think my goal for the rest of the year is to have fun competing again and to really enjoy competing,” Gauff said. “Because I think when I’m not so worried about results or ranking, that’s when I play my best tennis. This whole training block — when we found out there were tournaments again — has just been to continue to improve.”

HOUSTON — Tobe Nwigwe has spent five years as an independent rapper and singer on the Houston scene, building an audience — including fans like Erykah Badu and Michelle Obama — with weekly song drops that unfailingly arrive with a brand-new video. His plan has always been consistency, not virality. But sudden, unexpected fame arrived last month after he released a track that called attention to the police killing of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.
“I need you to,” Nwigwe sings as the track opens. Then in his typical sober rumble, he raps, “Arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor.” The entire song, called “I Need You To (Breonna Taylor),” is 44 seconds long, with spare production. It was reposted by Diddy, LeBron James, Madonna and Amy Schumer. “Try Jesus,” a ballad he released at the end of July, has become even more popular. It has more than 1 million YouTube views and helped him land his first two placements on Billboard’s genre sales charts.
On a recent morning Nwigwe, 33, was at work as usual, shooting a video for a song called “Eat” in his sea-foam green living room, wearing a sea-foam green outfit and a gold grill. He was surrounded by his usual production crew, including his wife, Fat, 32; and their best friend and producer, LaNell Grant, 31, known as Nell. As the camera moved around him, the rapper held his arms out so that Ivory, 1, his elder of two daughters, could join him. Baby Fat, as she is affectionately called by her family, looked around, a sly smile on her face, and finally wiggled her way onto the set.
Nwigwe’s family has always played a large role in his art. Although Tobe Nwigwe is the name on the songs, Fat and Grant are inextricable from the final product. Operating outside the label system, with no publicity representation or managers, the three handle all of their personal and professional business themselves: designing their outfits, booking gigs and watching each other’s children.
“Because I do this with my family, I don’t even want people that I don’t know like that around my family,” Nwigwe said in an interview the evening before the shoot. “I don’t believe in somebody who didn’t help me build everything —” he added before Grant finished his sentence, “come in and take.” In sweats and their signature white shin-length socks, the three sat in swivel chairs, ribbing one another with inside jokes.
Hip-hop wasn’t always on the agenda for Nwigwe. “I thought I was going to be the next Ray Lewis,” he said as he rocked Ivory to sleep. He grew up Tobechuwu Nwigwe in the Southwest Alief neighborhood of Houston with Nigerian immigrant parents and focused on sports, although his family hoped he might become a doctor, lawyer, engineer or pilot. An NFL prospect, he was a linebacker for the University of North Texas, working out twice a day, plowing through bodies and cheating on his homework, until he experienced a career-ending injury.
Grant, who went to the same high school, thought she might make the WNBA and instead became a high school English teacher, taking production classes in her off hours. Fat (born Ivory Rogers), from Grand Rapids, Michigan, had an idea she might be an artist but felt sure that she was supposed to move to Houston. The three came together while working with the “edutainment” nonprofit Nwigwe founded to help Alief children figure out their purpose. After finding validation and financial support from motivational speaker Eric Thomas and his business partner Carlas Quinney, they began focusing on music in earnest.
In 2017, Nwigwe began making videos and dropping weekly singles on YouTube and Instagram for what he called #getTWISTEDsundays. In early releases, he sits on the floor of his living room rapping while Fat, with her gently chiseled stoicism, twists his hair or folds laundry. As the music grew tighter and more stylized, so did the sets (fields, gyms, warehouses, caves) and the outfits (gold mesh robes, brocade tunics, tie-dye sweatsuits).
The videos have always been very personal, intermingling conversations about topics like Black men’s experiences with PTSD and child rearing, candid moments of the group on tour and even Nwigwe’s proposal to Fat. “This is what life looks like all the time,” Nwigwe said. Grant laughed exuberantly as she explained that she and her husband, Cory, live at the Nwigwe household part time, patting her belly and announcing herself in “baby season.”
The music has also always had a spiritual element. Nwigwe said he wrote “I Need You To (Breonna Taylor)” because he had a dream in which God told him to. “Make it Home,” another recent release, is a slow, soulful ballad that wishes an idyllic afterlife upon his crew. “This for the nappy heads in heaven/With a nappy head Christ by they side/Yeah, may your streets be paved with gold/Yeah, hope my whole hood makes it home.”
Nwigwe, who grew up Catholic, describes his relationship with God as a way to channel his instincts, which, like his football skills, stray combative. “Try Jesus” illustrates the point: “Try Jesus/Not me/’Cause I throw hands.”
Today, he diverts this energy into collaboration with his team. When there’s an atmosphere he wants infused into a song, he gives Grant a few descriptive words to translate into a track. When he wants a dress or a tunic designed — right now, inspired by his trips to Nigeria and Japan — he pieces together ideas on Pinterest and sends them to a local Cameroonian tailor. The only thing Nwigwe does entirely alone is writing and freestyling.
The group is so locked in to its own rhythms and systems that when record labels come calling — Nwigwe said he had been contacted by Mass Appeal, Roc Nation and Sony — executives don’t quite know what to offer them. “They have someone call you and say, ‘Anything we can do,’” Fat said.
Nwigwe’s response? “What can you do for me that I’m not already doing?” The question is, what can you do for an artist who has built his own beautiful, efficient engine, fueled by his family and best friends, without giving up ownership or profit?
“Fifty million dollars!” Grant said with a cackle. But then she got serious, explaining that the label system might simply not be right for them. “I don’t know if what you do translates to what we do,” she said.
“The thing about us,” Nwigwe said, “is we’re not lazy.”
The Nwigwe engine revved as the “Eat” shoot carried on. Three dancers called the Black Angels Collective ran through their choreography in tiered sea-foam tulle pants. Grant took a steamer to her and Nwigwe’s linen outfits. Fat twisted Ivory’s hair and touched up her lipstick. And Nwigwe reminded everyone to keep their vibe up, to yell the lyrics if they needed to make it feel more real.

Cracking Codes With Sanford Biggers

One afternoon in June, artist Sanford Biggers, having returned to the city after a stretch bunkered out of town with his wife and young daughter to avoid the pandemic, opened up his expansive basement studio in Harlem for a socially distanced visit.
Biggers is a specialist in many styles, and several were in evidence. A shimmering silhouette made entirely of black sequins, for instance, towered along one wall; it depicted a Black Power protester drawn from a late 1960s photograph.
There were African statuettes that Biggers purchases in markets, then dips in wax and modifies at the shooting range — a wrenching sculpture by gunfire that he has exhibited as multichannel videos. There were also busts from a series he is making in bronze and another in marble, with artisans in Italy. They merge Masai, Luba, and other African sculptural traits with ones from the Greco-Roman tradition.
Most of all, there were quilts — stretched against the wall, piled onto pallets, in scraps on the cutting table. For more than a decade, Biggers has been working with antique quilts alongside his other media. He disrupts these heirlooms with bold paint strokes, adorns them with imagery, cuts into them to inspect the void.
“They’re portals, in a sense,” he said. “I consider them between painting, drawing and sculpture, and a repository of memory — the memory of the body.”
The quilt, vernacular object par excellence, proved to be rich terrain for what Biggers calls “material storytelling.” As the full scope of his quilt work comes into view, it sheds new light on his long-held concerns — with the Black experience, American violence, Buddhism and art history — and reveals interior dimensions of his personal journey.
Biggers made his first two quilt works in 2009, installing them at Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. One of the vintage quilts had a flower pattern; the other was plaid. On each, he transposed from a historical map the locations of the church and safe houses from the Underground Railroad, marked them like stars in a constellation and connected them with charcoal and oil stick.
The reference was to a theory that holds that people along the Underground Railroad shared crucial information in code through quilts hanging at safe houses and other waypoints. Scholars have found little validating evidence, but for Biggers, the fact of folk knowledge, even when it’s apocryphal, has worth in itself. “It’s more important that the story endures,” he said.
This fall, an exhibition of nearly 60 of Biggers’ quilt-based pieces, titled “Codeswitch,” will open at the Bronx Museum of the Arts before traveling in 2021 to Los Angeles — where the artist grew up — and New Orleans. A separate fall show planned at Marianne Boesky Gallery in Manhattan, titled “Soft Truths,” will present new quilt works juxtaposed with his Afro-European marbles.
Sparked by his interest in hidden codes, Biggers’ quilts in turn reveal hidden connections amid his eclectic oeuvre. “It’s this series of works that has allowed me to read his other work well and really come to terms with what it might be up to,” said Andrea Andersson, director of the Rivers Institute in New Orleans, who curated “Codeswitch” with Antonio Sergio Bessa of the Bronx Museum.
Biggers, who turns 50 this year, is perhaps best known for his conceptual installations mingling pathos and dark humor. In “Blossom,” first shown in 2007 at Grand Arts in Kansas City, Missouri, and later acquired by the Brooklyn Museum, an artificial tree bursts through a baby grand that he has converted to a player piano; it plays his arrangement of “Strange Fruit,” the haunting anti-lynching lament.
“Laocoön,” involving a massive, inflatable vinyl Fat Albert character prone on the floor, seemingly struggling to breathe — based on the Iliad character, depicted in Renaissance sculpture as an icon of suffering — caused some unease when it was shown at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2015 and the next year at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit for its apparent allusions to police killings of Black men and to the cartoon’s originator, Bill Cosby.
These works mobilized popular imagery and challenged viewers. When Biggers works on quilts, the approach is different: The concept is not in the final shape but in the process. The work is improvisational, meditative, private.
“I don’t have a vision of what I want to put on the quilt and then hammer it in,” he said. “I sit with these quilts for months or years before I can make a single mark. And then it’s led by what the material is going to give back.”
Biggers has chafed against the art world’s category silos, even while working his way through some of its prestigious precincts. He earned his master’s degree in the late 1990s at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, specializing in painting, but set that practice aside once he arrived in New York in 1999 as an artist in residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem.
In “Freestyle,” the museum’s influential 2001 exhibition of new Black artists, he showed a collaboration with Jennifer Zackin, “A Small World.” A side-by-side montage of home movies from each artist’s childhood, it pointed to uncanny similarities between life in Black middle-class LA families and New York Jewish families, while underscoring the absurdity of enduring social barriers. The work was reprised in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.
Biggers was also making music — a talent he continues to cultivate, leading and playing keys in Moon Medicin, his avant-funk ensemble that includes Martin Luther and DJ Jahi Sundance and is inspired by Sun Ra. “That might be his superpower,” said poet Saul Williams, a collaborator and friend since their undergraduate days at Morehouse College in Atlanta. “His relationship to music is something that strengthens his work and emboldens his gaze.”
Meanwhile, Biggers was making work with a ritual charge. Multiple projects invoked mandalas, circles bearing geometries sacred in Eastern religions. Some were joyous and participatory — for instance, the patterned linoleum dance floors that he set up at break-dancing competitions around New York, inviting contestants, welcoming the scuffing.
Their title, “Mandala for the B-Bodhisattva,” marked the B-boy, or break dancer, as a kind of enlightened being. The concept enfolded influences from Biggers’ youth in the LA hip-hop scene (he rapped, DJed, danced and wrote graffiti) and his three years teaching English in Japan, where he got into religion and aesthetics and frequented monasteries.
The mandala turned mournful in “Lotus,” a suspended disc of etched glass with an intricate petal pattern, first shown in 2007. Up close, the petals turned out to repeat an 18th-century diagram of a slave ship hold. The image is one of various symbols — the tree, the piano, the clenched fist, the Cheshire Cat smile — that he carries across formats, including quilts.
“I’m riffing on them like a jazz musician would riff on a song standard,” he said.
Biggers’ syncretism is its own method, with its formal fluidity, its propensity toward everyday materials and a certain dance away from fixed meanings. Painter Julie Mehretu, his close friend for more than 20 years, described him as both an explorer and an instigator, inviting the viewer’s inquiry while already slipping to the next idea. “There’s always this embedded, implicit sociality in the material he uses and in what he’s investigating,” Mehretu said.
In “South of Pico,” a study of Black art in LA, scholar Kellie Jones called him an heir to the great multidisciplinary artists David Hammons and Senga Nengudi, their “peripatetic postminimalist aesthetic” and “relentless expression as performance.” She added, “Biggers deflects. He becomes a facilitator. It is a way of escaping categorization.”
Although based in New York, Biggers still identifies with LA, where he grew up in Baldwin Hills, a son of a neurosurgeon, in a milieu that mingled with and collected Black artists. (His parents moved from Texas so his father could practice medicine; John Biggers, the distinguished Houston-based muralist and teacher, was a relative.)
On his return from Japan, he said, it was elder LA artists such as Varnette Honeywood and Samella Lewis who took him under their wing and pointed him to art school. He would drive to the desert to visit Noah Purifoy in his found-object sculpture garden. “It felt like going to see the oracle,” he said. “It gave me the inspiration to see that you don’t have to follow the norms.”
Like many with Southern roots, Biggers had some quilters in the family. His epiphany, however, came with the landmark “Quilts of Gee’s Bend” show at the Whitney Museum in 2002. In the magisterial work of the Alabama quilters, he said, he saw all the possibilities of painting and more. “There was color, modulation, rhythm and all these compositional things,” he said. “But seeing them in these beautiful textile works made by a woman’s hands, it was touching on sculpture, touching on the body, touching on politics.”
In the studio, Biggers showed a few quilt pieces in progress: one, with light purple and green squares, that he was turning into a landscape with boughs and yellow blossoms; another, mostly orange and gray, onto which he added gold strips to complicate the lattice motif. Lurking on one quilt was a QR code; once scanned, it opened an audio track by Moon Medicin.
Biggers’ quilt work has grown in the same years that the Black Lives Matter movement has intensified, parallel to his own increasingly furious sculptures addressing violence and responding to the cascade of mass-circulated videos of Black deaths. His “BAM” series of gunshot statuettes, which he began in 2015 in a rage, are dedicated to victims of police killings whom we have come to know by their first names: “BAM (for Sandra), “BAM (for Philando)” and so on. They are not depicted directly but symbolically, by means of an African figurative sculpture dipped in wax and taken to a shooting range; the damaged but heroic effigy is then recast in bronze.
When Biggers showed “BAM (for Michael)” in St. Louis in 2018, he met first with Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, who was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, and received her blessing. He likened the works to power figures, like the Congolese nkisi: “The action of shooting them, dipping them in wax — the whole protracted process is a way of giving them power, charging them,” he said.
Both the method and the naming draw occasional pushback from visitors to his exhibitions, but, he said, “the only way to communicate this type of pain is to do something like this that will make people get pissed off at you.” When the Legacy Museum at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, acquired “BAM (For Michael),” he felt validated.
It’s his own exhaustion that has caused him to pause the “BAM” series, and he is no longer watching the death videos for now. “I can’t deal with that today. It’s overload,” he said. “There’s a point where there’s no longer any detachment from these things happening.”
The quilts, however, continue. Their softness is their strength. Their transmittal attests to survival; whether they broadcast freedom codes during the Underground Railroad or not, an artist can inscribe them now with salutary information for today.
On the studio floor, Biggers spread two untouched vintage quilts, both red, white and blue, but in clashing patterns — one a grid of small squares split in triangles, the other building out from the center like a kaleidoscope image. He described a possible tall piece combining the two, with a totemic feel.
Lately, he said, has been working mostly by subtraction, cutting sections from quilts. “To create two things with red, white and blue, and then take something from it is the gesture,” he said. “Working through the idea of the demise of our democracy.”
The material would guide him from there, he said. Biggers is just the latest artisan in a continuing historical chain. “It’s not for me to say what they mean now,” he said. “These are objects for a future ethnography.”

Adolph Reed is a son of the segregated South, a native of New Orleans who organized poor Black people and anti-war soldiers in the late 1960s and became a leading socialist scholar at a trio of top universities.
Along the way, he acquired the conviction, controversial today, that the left is too focused on race and not enough on class. Lasting victories were achieved, he believed, when working-class and poor people of all races fought shoulder to shoulder for their rights.
In late May, Reed, now 73 and a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, was invited to speak to the Democratic Socialists of America’s New York City chapter. The match seemed a natural. Possessed of a barbed wit, the man who campaigned for Sen. Bernie Sanders and skewered President Barack Obama as a man of “vacuous to repressive neoliberal politics” would address the DSA’s largest chapter, the crucible that gave rise to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a new generation of leftist activism.
His chosen topic was unsparing: He planned to argue that the left’s intense focus on the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on Black people undermined multiracial organizing, which he sees as key to health and economic justice.
Notices went up. Anger built. How could we invite a man to speak, members asked, who downplays racism in a time of plague and protest? To let him talk, the organization’s Afrosocialists and Socialists of Color Caucus stated, was “reactionary, class-reductionist and, at best, tone-deaf.”
“We cannot be afraid to discuss race and racism because it could get mishandled by racists,” the caucus stated. “That’s cowardly and cedes power to the racial capitalists.”
Amid murmurs that opponents might crash his Zoom talk, Reed and DSA leaders agreed to cancel it, a striking moment as perhaps the nation’s most powerful socialist organization rejected a Black Marxist professor’s talk because of his views on race.
“God have mercy, Adolph is the greatest democratic theorist of his generation,” said Cornel West, a Harvard University professor of philosophy and a socialist. “He has taken some very unpopular stands on identity politics, but he has a track record of a half-century. If you give up discussion, your movement moves toward narrowness.”
The decision to silence Reed came as Americans debate the role of race and racism in policing, health care, media and corporations. Often pushed aside in that discourse are those leftists and liberals who have argued there is too much focus on race and not enough on class in a deeply unequal society. Reed is part of the class of historians, political scientists and intellectuals who argue that race as a construct is overstated.
This debate is particularly potent as activists sense a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make progress on issues ranging from police violence to mass incarceration to health and inequality. And it comes as socialism in America — long a predominantly white movement — attracts younger and more diverse adherents.
Many leftist and liberal scholars argue that current disparities in health, police brutality and wealth inequality are due primarily to the nation’s history of racism and white supremacy. Race is America’s primal wound, they said, and Black people, after centuries of slavery and Jim Crow segregation, should take the lead in a multiracial fight to dismantle it. To set that battle aside in pursuit of ephemeral class solidarity is preposterous, they argue.
“Adolph Reed and his ilk believe that if we talk about race too much, we will alienate too many, and that will keep us from building a movement,” said Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, a Princeton University professor of African American studies and a DSA member. “We don’t want that; we want to win white people to an understanding of how their racism has fundamentally distorted the lives of Black people.”
A contrary view is offered by Reed and some prominent scholars and activists, many of whom are Black. They see the current emphasis in the culture on race-based politics as a dead end. They include West; historians Barbara Fields of Columbia University and Toure Reed — Adolph Reed’s son — of Illinois State; and Bhaskar Sunkara, founder of Jacobin, a socialist magazine.
They readily accept the brute reality of America’s racial history and of racism’s toll. They argue, however, that the problems now bedeviling America — such as wealth inequality, police brutality and mass incarceration — affect Black and brown Americans but also large numbers of working-class and poor white Americans.
The most powerful progressive movements, they said, take root in the fight for universal programs. That was true of the laws that empowered labor organizing and established mass jobs programs during the New Deal, and it is true of the current struggles for free public college tuition, a higher minimum wage, reworked police forces and single-payer health care.
Those programs would disproportionately help Black, Latino and Native American people, who on average have less family wealth and suffer ill health at rates exceeding that of white Americans, Reed and his allies argue. To fixate on race risks dividing a potentially powerful coalition and playing into the hands of conservatives.
“An obsession with disparities of race has colonized the thinking of left and liberal types,” Reed said. “There’s this insistence that race and racism are fundamental determinants of all Black people’s existence.”
These battles are not new: In the late 19th century, socialists wrestled with their own racism and debated the extent to which they should try to build a multiracial organization. Eugene Debs, who ran for president five times, was muscular in his insistence that his party advocate racial equality. Similar questions roiled the civil rights and Black power movements of the 1960s.
But the debate has been reignited by the spread of the deadly virus and the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. And it has taken on a generational tone, as socialism — in the 1980s largely the redoubt of aging leftists — now attracts many younger people eager to reshape organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America, which has existed in various permutations since the 1920s. (A Gallup poll late last year found that socialism is now as popular as capitalism among people ages 18-39.)
The DSA now has more than 70,000 members nationally and 5,800 in New York — and their average age now hovers in the early 30s. While the party is much smaller than, say, Democrats and Republicans, it has become an unlikely kingmaker, helping fuel the victories of Democratic Party candidates such as Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, who beat a longtime Democratic incumbent in a June primary.
In years past, the DSA had welcomed Reed as a speaker. But younger members, chafing at their COVID-19 isolation and throwing themselves into “Defund the Police” and anti-Trump protests, were angered to learn of the invitation extended to him.
“People have very strong concerns,” Chi Anunwa, co-chair of DSA’s New York chapter, said on a Zoom call. They said “the talk was too dismissive of racial disparities at a very tense point in American life.”
Taylor of Princeton said Reed should have known his planned talk on COVID-19 and the dangers of obsessing about racial disparities would register as “a provocation. It was quite incendiary.”
None of this surprised Reed, who sardonically described it as a “tempest in a demitasse.” Some on the left, he said, have a “militant objection to thinking analytically.”
Reed is an intellectual duelist who especially enjoys lancing liberals he sees as too cozy with corporate interests. He wrote that President Bill Clinton and his liberal followers showed a “willingness to sacrifice the poor and to tout it as tough-minded compassion” and described former Vice President Joe Biden as a man whose “tender mercies have been reserved for the banking and credit card industries.”
He finds a certain humor in being attacked over race.
“I’ve never led with my biography, as that’s become an authenticity-claiming gesture,” he said. “But when my opponents say that I don’t accept that race is real, I think to myself, ‘OK, we’ve arrived at a strange place.”
Reed and his compatriots believe the left too often ensnares itself in battles over racial symbols, from statues to language, rather than keeping its eye on fundamental economic change.
“If I said to you, ‘You’re laid off, but we’ve managed to rename Yale to the name of another white person,’ you would look at me like I’m crazy,” said Sunkara, editor of Jacobin.
Better, they argue, to talk of commonalities. While there is a vast wealth gap between Black and white Americans, poor and working-class white people are remarkably similar to poor and working-class Black people when it comes to income and wealth, which is to say they possess very little of either. Democratic Party politicians, Reed and his allies said, wield race as a dodge to avoid grappling with big economic issues that cut deeper, such as wealth redistribution, as that would upset their base of rich donors.
“Liberals use identity politics and race as a way to counter calls for redistributive polices,” noted Toure Reed, whose book “Toward Freedom: The Case Against Race Reductionism” tackles these subjects.
Some on the left counter that Adolf Reed and his allies ignore that a strong emphasis on race is not only good politics but also common-sense organizing.
“Not only do Black people suffer class oppression,” said Taylor of Princeton, “they also suffer racial oppression. They are fundamentally more marginalized than white people.
“How do we get in the door without talking race and racism?”
I put that question to Reed. The son of itinerant, radical academics, he passed much of his boyhood in New Orleans. “I came back and forth into the Jim Crow South and developed a special hatred for that system,” he said.
Yet even as he has taken pleasure of late as New Orleans removed memorials to the old Confederacy, he preferred a different symbolism. He recalled, as a boy, traveling to small New England towns, walking through cemeteries and seeing moss-covered tombstones marking the graves of young white men who had died in service of the Union.
“I got this warm feeling reading those tombstones, ‘So-and-so died so that all men could be free,’” he said. “There was something so damned moving about that.”

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would consider pardoning Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who faced criminal charges after leaking classified documents about vast government surveillance.
“There are many, many people — it seems to be a split decision — many people think that he should be somehow be treated differently and other people think he did very bad things,” Trump said during a news conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. “I’m going to take a very good look at it.”
The remarks signal a shift for the president, who repeatedly denigrated Snowden as a “traitor” and a “spy who should be executed” in the years before his election. The disclosures by Snowden, who sought asylum in Russia in 2013, set off a broad debate about surveillance and privacy.
Critics have accused Snowden of treason for revealing classified information while privacy and civil liberties advocates have praised him for exposing the scope of the government’s surveillance programs, which included sweeping up phone records of American citizens and eavesdropping on foreign leaders.
Speculation about a pardon for Snowden has grown since the president commented on the case in an interview with the New York Post on Thursday. “There are a lot of people that think that he is not being treated fairly,” Trump said in the interview. “I mean, I hear that.”
For Snowden, a pardon would be a chance to return to the United States. In 2013, he was charged with violating the Espionage Act, which carries a prison sentence. As long as he faces those charges, Snowden has said, he will not return to the United States. Human rights groups urged President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden, but they had no success.
Also Saturday, Trump, asked whether he still had confidence in the leadership of Defense Secretary Mark Esper, appeared to mock his Pentagon chief.
“Yesper? Did you call him Yesper? Some people call him Yesper,” Trump replied. “No, I get along with him. I get along with him fine.”
Tensions between Trump and Esper escalated this year when Esper broke publicly with the president over whether federal troops should have been used to control protests that erupted across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd.
Trump has made a habit of assailing top appointees who have left the administration on bad terms, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in protest in 2018; Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was forced out in 2018; and national security adviser John Bolton, who stepped down in 2019.
Pushed further by a journalist to answer whether he had ever considered firing Esper, Trump simply shrugged.
“I consider firing everybody at some point,” the president said.

The ‘Rage Moms’ Democrats Are Counting On

President Bill Clinton introduced America to the “soccer mom,” anxiously shuttling her children across swing state suburbs in her minivan. President George W. Bush’s reelection campaign found another cutesy moniker, dubbing those voters worried about terrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11 “security moms.”
President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic is generating an entirely different sentiment, one not traditionally bestowed upon female voters or mothers.
“I am a rage mom,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the highest-ranking woman in Senate leadership. “Well, a rage nana, at this point, as my granddaughter would say.”
With millions of American families facing an uncertain start to the school year, the struggle for child care, education and economic stability is fueling a political uprising, built on the anger of women who find themselves constantly — and indefinitely — expected to be teacher, caregiver, employee and parent.
As the pandemic roars on, voters across America remain deeply angry and worried about the future. But the vocal outrage from women, in particular, is clear on protest lines and in polling data. Women were more likely than men to report having participated in protests over the past two years, and mothers with children in the home were twice as likely as fathers to report participating in a protest, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from June.
Now, the rage moms are railing in Facebook groups about school shutdowns and in teacher union meetings about reopening without proper protection from the virus. They’re also packing virtual town halls with frustrations about schools, child care and the lack of leadership.
“There’s nobody giving us solutions,” said Kim Lopez, a mother of three in Glendale, Arizona, and part-time financial assistant, who is still unsure what her children’s schooling will look like this year. Lopez said she never considered herself political until this summer, when she brought her children to a small Black Lives Matter protest in the Phoenix suburbs. “It’s as if they don’t care what happens to families.”
Lopez is exactly the kind of voter Democrats hope will push them to victory in November, and they are aiming to turn that frustration with government inaction into a vote against Trump.
Last month, the Biden campaign kicked off a “Moms for Biden” group. On Zoom, one person after another spoke of fears and frustrations. Asked to name the most pressing issue for her, one mother couldn’t narrow it down. Instead, she simply said “less worry.”
Voters are likely to hear more about those child care concerns at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night, with remarks from many of the party’s most influential female politicians, including their new vice presidential nominee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California.
The broader focus on caregiving issues marks a significant shift in the political climate of even a few months ago, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made child care a centerpiece of her campaign in the Democratic presidential primary.
At campaign events six months ago, Warren’s proposals for universal, government-funded child care would elicit nods primarily from mothers in the crowd, she said, followed by quiet conversations in the selfie line with women about their personal struggle balancing work and child care.
During a virtual town hall meeting she held last month, however, more than half of the questions from the audience of 70,000 people were about schools, child care and working parents.
“Right now, I think women have just had it up to their eyeballs,” Warren said in an interview. “They no longer feel isolated and one-off in how they couldn’t figure out how to make the system work, and recognize the system is broken, and nobody’s making it work.”
Warren added: “They’re fired up. And I love it.”
The pandemic is the spark but the backlash against Trump has been burning since the day after his inauguration, when millions of women joined protests across the country. Their fire has endured through #MeToo, waves of teachers’ strikes led by predominantly female unions, the outcry against school shootings, and Black Lives Matter demonstrations, a movement started largely by female racial justice activists.
For the second election cycle in a row, a record-breaking number of female candidates are running for federal office. Biden’s selection of Harris was widely seen as a nod to the energy women have given the Democratic Party during the Trump era.
“Women are mobilized on a bigger scale than we’ve seen in a generation at least,” said Annelise Orleck, a historian at Dartmouth College who studies women’s political activism. “Women are organizing all across the spectrum.”
The activism is diffuse and multiracial, reflecting political battles that working class women have long waged for better health care, schools and child care. In some ways, more affluent suburban women are simply waking up to the untenable choices poorer women and women of color have faced for generations.
While the anger is loudest on the left, Democrats hope to capitalize on indications that the rage reaches across party lines. The rebellion by white college-educated women against Trump helped Democrats win key swing districts in 2018, giving the party control of the House. In recent weeks, support for Trump has begun to drop among white non-college educated women and older women — two more ideologically moderate groups that bolstered his winning coalition four years ago. The gender split among suburbanites is striking: In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, Biden leads by 24 points among suburban women and just 4 points among suburban men.
“I am so full of rage,” said Alida Garcia, vice president of Fwd.us, an immigration advocacy group and mother of 1-year-old twins. “We are exhausted.”
Last month, Biden announced a sweeping $775 billion caregiving proposal that would cover care for young children, older adults and family members with disabilities. He often invokes his experience as a single father caring for his two young sons after his first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash.
Biden has repeatedly described caregiving as an economic necessity that deserves sustained support, a marked shift in political rhetoric on a topic that was often seen by politicians as a special interest, not an issue to put at the center of a campaign.
Other Democratic politicians, too, have begun more forcefully addressing caregiving concerns. Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sponsored a webinar on “How to Organize a Child Care Collective.”
Parents with minor children comprise about one-third of the country’s work force, according to the Brookings Institutions. In 2018, 23.5 million working parents relied upon school and child care programs while they went to work.
“For the last 10, 20 years, this has been sidelined and siloed as just a women’s issue,” said Brigid Schulte, who runs the Better Life Lab at New America, a research group. “It’s not and it never has been.”
Throughout American history, women have wielded an image of maternal respectability to push for labor reforms, temperance, stoke fears of communist infiltration in the 1950s and other political causes.
In recent years, mothers-turned-activists have begun political organizations, including Moms Rising, Vote Like a Mother and Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy organization. The majority of volunteers with Indivisible, a liberal advocacy group that helped propel several Democrats to Congress in 2018, are women, and the topic of child care has become a de facto part of many meetings across the country.
“There isn’t a single thing you can offer up to women now, whether it’s text banking, leadership training, organizing skills, that’s not immediately oversubscribed,” said Cecile Richards, the head of Supermajority, an organization founded last year with the goal of mobilizing female voters. “It is this extraordinary moment when women are in the ascendancy and finally the issues that women have to deal with every day are at last in the public conversation in a way that they have not been in any time I remember.”
Richards says Supermajority planned for 800 women to sign up for a recent organizing training it offered. It got 1,800 responses in the first week.
“Moms definitely know how to multitask,” said Smitha Chadaga, who has spent a career working as an internist in a hospital and became politically active after the 2016 election, when her children asked if their family would have to leave the United States. (Chadaga’s parents immigrated from India and her husband’s family came from Nicaragua.)
In addition to her work and her involvement with an Indivisible group in Portland, Oregon, Chadaga is caring for her two boys, ages 8 and 10. It is impossible to miss the heightened interest and anger of mothers, she said.
“The fact that we do not value child care, that we don’t value early education, this is not something that COVID created — it’s something that COVID exposed,” she said. “The moms and parents around me are all feeling that very same thing.”
While Democrats have proposed the most ambitious plans to tackle child care, there are some signs that Republicans, too, are facing pressure to address the issue. Last month, the House passed two bills that would provide more than $220 billion in funding for child care centers and tax credits. Each bill had support from more than a dozen Republicans, a notable number in a deeply polarized Congress.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., another primary candidate who made child care a central part of her presidential bid, said she constantly hears from people who are worried about child care.
“It wasn’t easy for most parents that I’ve talked to. To have no access to child care is crippling,” she said. She hopes the crisis point reached by many families during the pandemic will create political momentum for policies like paid leave, universal early childhood education and universal sick days.
For Murray, the activism is both hopeful and a bittersweet reminder of just how much has stayed the same over three decades.
“I came here, as a senator, as the first working mother. I am now, a generation later, watching my daughter and son deal with the same issue,” Murray said. “This pandemic has ripped wide an open wound that families have struggled with for a long time.”

STURGIS, S.D. — And just like that, the roar of the motorcycles was gone.
Ten days after Sturgis, South Dakota., drew hundreds of thousands of bikers from all over the country to its signature motorcycle rally despite concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, the parties ended and most of the crowds headed home Sunday.
Uncertain still was what effect, if any, the event will have on the spread of the virus. Because of the time it can take for symptoms to appear and the way coronavirus cases are tracked in the United States, officials may never know whether the annual rally was a place where the virus was widely passed along.
There were no immediate signs that the rally had led to a significant uptick: The county that includes Sturgis has reported 104 coronavirus cases during the pandemic, 33 of them since the start of August. On Monday, state health officials said they knew of one case of the virus in someone who had attended the motorcycle rally, according to The Rapid City Journal. And Mark Schulte, president of Monument Health Sturgis Hospital, confirmed that some people in Sturgis for the rally had tested positive for the virus, though he would not say how many.
But if a flurry of new cases were to emerge — days from now or even longer — they would likely be reported by attendees back in their hometowns, and would not necessarily ever be tied to the rally.
It is a challenge that public health officials have faced repeatedly as they try to understand how the coronavirus is making its way through the country: When people gather for a large event and then return to states with different health departments, it is difficult to be sure whether the event was part of an outbreak.
The issue has stymied certainty about how the virus’s spread has been affected by events like a rally for President Donald Trump in Oklahoma, protests in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd, holiday weekend visits to the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans and spring break trips to Florida.
The rally in Sturgis, one of the biggest regional events to proceed amid the pandemic, drew attention from all over. More than 350,000 vehicles had flocked into the small town during the first week of the event, according to the South Dakota Department of Transportation.
“It’s more than we anticipated by far,” said Dan Ainslie, the city manager of Sturgis.
Local officials had set up precautions — hand sanitizing stations and capacity limits inside some buildings. But many people went without masks, and some supporters suggested that a mostly-outdoor event did not require face coverings.
“You have to be careful, but at the same time, you have to live,” said Mike Petrocco, a Sturgis resident who has long offered his lawn as a campsite during rallies. Petrocco, 64, said that at one point this year he was hosting 16 people, and that he offered hand sanitizer, did laundry and cleaned every day.
But tracking virus outbreaks, if they were to emerge, is complex and might involve multiple health departments in different states. Cases discovered in other states might never be known to South Dakota officials unless close contacts were carefully traced back.
In this city that ordinarily is home to fewer than 7,000 people, some residents seemed relieved that it was over. “There was no stopping it. People had plans to come, whether we were going to have it or not,” said Lisa Logan, 60, who left town for Iowa for much of the 10 days.
Sixty percent of residents favored postponing the event, according to a city survey, and hospital officials said they intend later this week to administer coronavirus tests to any Sturgis resident who wants one.
“It bothers me that they are so inconsiderate of their own health, the health of the folks who hosted them and for their families back home,” said Melissa Two Crow, 65.
Native American tribes in western South Dakota turned away motorcyclists who attempted to travel through the reservations to Sturgis. Rides through the reservations in South Dakota feature the rocky hill formations of the Badlands, views of the Missouri River and green hilly plains with small creeks cutting through.
“If they’ve come from out of state or from hot spots, we turn them away and ask them to seek an alternate route to their destinations,” said Remi Bald Eagle, the intergovernmental affairs coordinator for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.
By the time the motorcycle rally was winding down, South Dakota had been added to New York’s list of states from which travelers are required to quarantine for 14 days.
Images of the motorcyclists in Sturgis led New Hampshire leaders to issue a mask mandate ahead of Laconia Motorcycle Week, which is scheduled for late August.
“Sturgis was a real clear warning sign to us,” Gov. Chris Sununu said during a news conference. “I don’t think anyone saw the photos out of Sturgis and said, ‘That looks safe.’”

HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — To Krystina François, a Haitian American executive director of a Miami nonprofit organization, Kamala Harris is a lot like her, a first-generation daughter of immigrants pursuing the American dream.
To Nicole Sanchez, a Chicana consultant in Berkeley, California, Harris is an ambitious woman who listened to the same 1990s hip-hop as she did growing up.
And to Carol Kim, an Asian American union organizer in San Diego, Harris is the first woman on a national stage whom she can point to and say to her daughter, “She is one of us.”
In Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and California senator, each of the women said they saw someone familiar. And as Harris, whose father immigrated from Jamaica and whose mother immigrated from India, reaches the highest echelons of American politics, dozens of women of color said they also view her success as their own.
“How could you not see this as a victory?” Afrah Hamin, 66, said of the announcement last week by Joe Biden that he had chosen Harris as his running mate.
“Finally,” continued Hamin, an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sister of Harris’ from south Florida, “the country sees us, sees who we are, sees what we can do.”
In interviews with dozens of Black, Latina and Asian American women, many of them said Harris’ story was also their story. In Harris’ life, they recognized both her triumphs and the challenges that come with living in a country wrestling with its history of discrimination.
“It’s the twin devils of racism and sexism,” said Sanchez, 47, who lives blocks from the elementary school Harris attended. “We are told our whole lives to educate ourselves and work hard — God forbid it actually works, we get told we’re asking for too much.”
On Wednesday, Harris is scheduled to address a national audience during the virtual Democratic National Convention, and is all but certain to invoke her personal history and her barrier-breaking status as the first Black woman and the first Asian American woman on a major party’s presidential ticket.
It is a moment long overdue, many women said, even while acknowledging the historic run by Hillary Clinton four years ago.
With Harris, the women of color said they thought of their own childhoods and workplace struggles. Some recalled difficult experiences in boardrooms and courtrooms, in salary negotiations and in countless conversations about inequality.
Still, during Harris’ presidential primary bid last year, some of the most persistent doubts came from liberal voters, including Black and Latina women, who criticized her law enforcement record as a prosecutor and the impersonal way in which she has spoken about race.
Some of the women said they wanted her to confront her prosecutorial record directly in her speech Wednesday night and make clear what she might have done differently when she was California’s attorney general.
“Sometimes I feel like if she could just admit that she has done things that have hurt other Black people, and then talked about her race, it would feel more genuine,” said Alexandra Warren, 24, a lawyer in Boston.
“I don’t feel, honestly, a sense of representation because I know representation has never won a revolution,” Warren said. “Representation has never freed anybody from jail, representation has never ended structural inequalities, representation has never been able to fix structural violence.”
But even someone as liberal as Sanchez, who considers herself “to the left of the left,” was supportive of Harris and aware of all that she had overcome.
“You don’t get to enter those halls without compromise,” Sanchez said. “There’s always this line between ‘I am going to tell you the truth but in a way you can hear’ versus an activist standpoint. There is no way she is the vice president candidate without having made trade-offs.”
Many women also said they wanted to hear Harris speak candidly about her own experiences with race and racism. She has, at times, appeared to shy away from talking about what she eventually called the “donkey in the room,” the mostly whispered notion among Democratic voters that the country would not be willing to elect a woman who is both Black and Asian to the White House.
But much has changed: During the nationally televised convention this week, two other Black women referred to her as “sister.”
Still, many women recognize how difficult it is to speak about personal experiences.
“We’re expected to be perfect but not too perfect,” said Kacey Bonner, a 42-year-old communications consultant in Los Angeles whose parents grew up in the segregated South.
“We’re expected to stay in the box that others think we should be in, and anytime we stray from that we’re punished,” she continued. “You can say lots of things about Senator Harris, but she has refused to be in others’ boxes. And now we’re seeing both the benefits and cost of that.”
In the final weeks of Biden’s search for a running mate, some advisers warned him that Harris was too “ambitious.” Harris quickly took a term that was wielded as criticism and embraced it, encouraging young women of color to do the same.
“There will be a resistance to your ambition, there will be people who say to you, ‘You are out of your lane,’ ” Harris said July 31 during a livestream conversation for the virtual Black Girls Lead conference.
“They are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be,” she added. “But don’t you let that burden you.”
As demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality continue, François, 31, said she hoped that Harris would acknowledge the impact of her prosecutorial record and pledge reforms to the criminal justice system in her speech Wednesday.
“Black folks, particularly younger Black folks, are at a point where we feel like respectability and the status quo are not enough,” François said. “We want our leaders to make Black lives a priority and to shift the systems that do not serve us and were not made for us.”
She said she also hoped to hear Harris begin making the case for the Democratic ticket — and not just the case against President Donald Trump — while also projecting her biracial identity as a strength.
“I want her to say, ‘I am Black. I am a woman. I am a Black woman. And I own it,’ ” François said.
Within a day of Harris’ joining the Biden ticket, her biracial heritage came under siege with name-calling and birtherism attacks from Trump and others in the Republican Party.
“I want to hold her accountable as a candidate,” François said, “but I also felt like I had to defend both her blackness and her humanity. She was being attacked on both sides.”
And some of the women braced themselves for the disappointment that would come with a Biden-Harris loss, just as they were disappointed four years ago.
“I really grew up believing the American dream, then I realized how ugly the underbelly was in 2016,” Kim said. “I am afraid that people are more racist and sexist than we realize and it will just break my heart.”

Democrats on Tuesday night officially approved a new party platform, outlining a sweeping set of policies on key issues including health care, climate change and the economy.
But the platform also reinforced divisions among the party’s moderates and its liberal wing, which has expressed disappointment that the official Democratic agenda does not support “Medicare for All,” the universal, single-payer health care proposal championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that has become a pillar of the progressive movement. Some refused to vote for the platform as a form of protest.
A largely symbolic document, the party platform does not contain specific legislation or binding commitments. Taken as a whole, however, it provides a broad look at the party’s agenda and the principles and values that Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, embrace.
The platform was written by a drafting committee that included members from the party’s progressive and more moderate wings. The Democratic National Committee’s platform committee then voted on the platform before sending it to all of the delegates who voted remotely on whether to approve it.
Last month in a parallel process, six Biden-Sanders “unity” task forces gave their own broad policy recommendations to the platform committee. The recommendations amounted to a collection of broadly accepted liberal policy proposals — much like the new platform.
The Coronavirus Pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic remains front of mind for many Americans, and Democrats signaled in their platform that responding to the crisis is a top concern. It is the first full policy section of the platform.
Many of the proposals are broadly consistent with what Democrats have so far supported, including increasing funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and providing more aid to state and local governments for initiatives specific to COVID-19, such as contact tracing.
Democrats also support free coronavirus testing and treatment for everyone as well as free vaccines when they become available. And they want to expand paid sick leave and unemployment insurance to help workers impacted by the health crisis.
Health Care
The section on health care is something of a catchall that broadly outlines Democrats’ desire to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, reduce health care costs and improve the quality of care. While it nods to Medicare for All, it stops far short of backing it.
But perhaps the most interesting part of the party’s stance on health care is how exactly it plans to expand coverage. Borrowing language from Sanders, the platform asserts that “health care is a right for all.” But it seeks to secure universal health care through a public option, not Medicare for All.
“Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen and build upon our bedrock health care programs, including the Affordable Care Act,” the platform reads. “Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable, quality coverage to every American.”
The Economy
The section of the platform that is devoted to the economy blends and borrows ideas from across the Democratic Party’s ideological spectrum. There are echoes of Sanders (“The U.S. economy is rigged against the American people”) and wonky subsections that address “Curbing Wall Street Abuses” and “Tackling Runaway Corporate Concentration” — issues highlighted repeatedly by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
Overall, there are few surprises here. Democrats, for instance, support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026, a policy already widely backed across the party. They want to invest in infrastructure, including high-speed rail.
Democrats also support aggressive steps to encourage homeownership by increasing affordable housing and by giving a $15,000 tax credit to first-time homebuyers, among other initiatives.
Perhaps most notably, the platform promises to “reject every effort to cut, privatize or weaken Social Security.” The pledge is particularly relevant following President Donald Trump’s push to cut payroll taxes, which Democrats said could jeopardize the funding stream for the popular government program.
Climate Change
The party’s platform sets aggressive goals of eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings by 2030, with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
But the platform makes no mention of the “Green New Deal,” a sweeping congressional resolution to combat climate change that is widely supported by the party’s progressive wing. It also does not call for an end to fossil fuel subsidies — an omission that has frustrated activists — although Biden’s plan does.
Other Highlights
The Democratic Party platform is filled with promises, many of them grand and somewhat vague.
But the lengthy document does contain several specific endorsements, such as supporting statehood for Washington, D.C., and a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country without legal permission.
Interestingly, Democrats want to “fast-track this process for those workers who have been essential to the pandemic response and recovery efforts.” The party also wants to end for-profit detention centers and instead “prioritize investments in more effective and cost-efficient community-based alternatives to detention.”
Here is a look at some of the other proposals:
Criminal Justice and Racial Justice
Democrats want to “overhaul the criminal justice system from top to bottom.” But notably, the platform does not include support for defunding the police, which has become a rallying cry for some activists amid the nationwide reckoning over racial justice and police brutality. Instead, Democrats support “national standards governing the use of force,” like banning chokeholds. The party also wants to eliminate cash bail.
Democrats support decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing its medical use. But the platform advocates for leaving it up to the states to determine whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use — a position that disappoints many progressives.
Education
Democrats support making public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families earn less than $125,000. The proposal does not go as far as the plan proposed by Sanders, which stipulates tuition-free public colleges and universities for everyone. The platform, however, does support making community colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all students.
Democrats also want to “ban for-profit private charter schools from receiving federal funding.”
Foreign Policy
Democrats support a two-state solution that would establish an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Democrats also believe that Jerusalem should remain the capital of Israel. Some activists have expressed disappointment with the platform because it does not criticize Israel’s “occupation” of Palestine.

HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — To Krystina François, a Haitian American executive director of a Miami nonprofit organization, Kamala Harris is a lot like her, a first-generation daughter of immigrants pursuing the American dream.
To Nicole Sanchez, a Chicana consultant in Berkeley, California, Harris is an ambitious woman who listened to the same 1990s hip-hop as she did growing up.
And to Carol Kim, an Asian American union organizer in San Diego, Harris is the first woman on a national stage whom she can point to and say to her daughter, “She is one of us.”
In Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate and California senator, each of the women said they saw someone familiar. And as Harris, whose father immigrated from Jamaica and whose mother immigrated from India, reaches the highest echelons of American politics, dozens of women of color said they also view her success as their own.
“How could you not see this as a victory?” Afrah Hamin, 66, said of the announcement last week by Joe Biden that he had chosen Harris as his running mate.
“Finally,” continued Hamin, an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sister of Harris’ from South Florida, “the country sees us, sees who we are, sees what we can do.”
In interviews with dozens of Black, Latina and Asian American women, many of them said Harris’ story was also their story. In Harris’ life, they recognized both her triumphs and the challenges that come with living in a country wrestling with its history of discrimination.
“It’s the twin devils of racism and sexism,” said Sanchez, 47, who lives blocks from the elementary school Harris attended. “We are told our whole lives to educate ourselves and work hard — God forbid it actually works, we get told we’re asking for too much.”
On Wednesday, Harris is scheduled to address a national audience during the virtual Democratic National Convention, and is all but certain to invoke her personal history and her barrier-breaking status as the first Black woman and the first Indian American woman on a major party’s presidential ticket.
It is a moment long overdue, many women said, even while acknowledging the historic run by Hillary Clinton four years ago.
With Harris, the women of color said they thought of their own childhoods and workplace struggles. Some recalled difficult experiences in boardrooms and courtrooms, in salary negotiations and in countless conversations about inequality.
Still, during Harris’ presidential primary bid last year, some of the most persistent doubts came from liberal voters, including Black and Latina women, who criticized her law enforcement record as a prosecutor and the impersonal way in which she has spoken about race.
Some of the women said they wanted her to confront her prosecutorial record directly in her speech Wednesday night and make clear what she might have done differently when she was California’s attorney general.
“Sometimes I feel like if she could just admit that she has done things that have hurt other Black people, and then talked about her race, it would feel more genuine,” said Alexandra Warren, 24, a lawyer in Boston.
“I don’t feel, honestly, a sense of representation because I know representation has never won a revolution,” Warren said. “Representation has never freed anybody from jail, representation has never ended structural inequalities, representation has never been able to fix structural violence.”
But even someone as liberal as Sanchez, who considers herself “to the left of the left,” was supportive of Harris and aware of all that she had overcome.
“You don’t get to enter those halls without compromise,” Sanchez said. “There’s always this line between ‘I am going to tell you the truth but in a way you can hear’ versus an activist standpoint. There is no way she is the vice president candidate without having made trade-offs.”
Many women also said they wanted to hear Harris speak candidly about her own experiences with race and racism. She has, at times, appeared to shy away from talking about what she eventually called the “donkey in the room,” the mostly whispered notion among Democratic voters that the country would not be willing to elect a woman who is both Black and Asian American to the White House.
But much has changed: During the nationally televised convention this week, two other Black women referred to her as “sister.”
Still, many women recognize how difficult it is to speak about personal experiences.
“We’re expected to be perfect but not too perfect,” said Kacey Bonner, a 42-year-old communications consultant in Los Angeles whose parents grew up in the segregated South.
“We’re expected to stay in the box that others think we should be in, and anytime we stray from that we’re punished,” she continued. “You can say lots of things about Sen. Harris, but she has refused to be in others’ boxes. And now we’re seeing both the benefits and cost of that.”
In the final weeks of Biden’s search for a running mate, some advisers warned him that Harris was too “ambitious.” Harris quickly took a term that was wielded as criticism and embraced it, encouraging young women of color to do the same.
“There will be a resistance to your ambition, there will be people who say to you, ‘You are out of your lane,’ ” Harris said July 31 during a livestream conversation for the virtual Black Girls Lead conference.
“They are burdened by only having the capacity to see what has always been instead of what can be,” she added. “But don’t you let that burden you.”
As demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality continue, François, 31, said she hoped that Harris would acknowledge the impact of her prosecutorial record and pledge reforms to the criminal justice system in her speech Wednesday.
“Black folks, particularly younger Black folks, are at a point where we feel like respectability and the status quo are not enough,” François said. “We want our leaders to make Black lives a priority and to shift the systems that do not serve us and were not made for us.”
She said she also hoped to hear Harris begin making the case for the Democratic ticket — and not just the case against President Donald Trump — while also projecting her biracial identity as a strength.
“I want her to say, ‘I am Black. I am a woman. I am a Black woman. And I own it,’ ” François said.
Within a day of Harris’ joining the Biden ticket, her biracial heritage came under siege with name-calling and birtherism attacks from Trump and others in the Republican Party.
“I want to hold her accountable as a candidate,” François said, “but I also felt like I had to defend both her blackness and her humanity. She was being attacked on both sides.”
And some of the women braced themselves for the disappointment that would come with a Biden-Harris loss, just as they were disappointed four years ago when Clinton lost to Trump.
“I really grew up believing the American dream, then I realized how ugly the underbelly was in 2016,” Kim said. “I am afraid that people are more racist and sexist than we realize and it will just break my heart.”

NEW YORK — More than 323,000 accusations of misconduct against current and former New York City police officers were published online Thursday, a major milestone in a long and contentious political battle to open records of police discipline to public scrutiny.
The records comprise all the civilian complaints filed since 1985 with the city’s independent police watchdog agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, and closed after an investigation.
Some 81,550 officers were named in the complaints, which together offer the public the broadest look to date at how officers are investigated and punished for a range of offenses, from using profanity and slurs to beating or choking people during arrests.
The complaints were published in an online database Thursday by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the records from the review board after state lawmakers repealed a law that had kept them secret.
The civil liberties union noted that less than .03% of the 323,511 complaints resulted in a penalty for officers, 12 of whom had been terminated. In a statement, Christopher Dunn, the organization’s legal director, said the records showed that the Police Department, whose commissioner makes the final decision on disciplinary matters, “is unwilling to police itself.”
“The release of this database is an important step towards greater transparency and accountability,” Dunn said, “and is just the beginning of unraveling the monopoly the NYPD holds on public information and officer discipline.”
Fred Davie, chairman of the review board, said in a statement that the agency released the records in response to demands from the public for greater police accountability, as evidenced most recently by the protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.
He said that “all New Yorkers have a right to transparency” under the state law granting access to public records and that his agency “will hold paramount the people’s right to know how their communities are policed.”
The records include all allegations of excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy and offensive language investigated by the review board, as well as the board’s findings and any discipline imposed by the police commissioner.
They were shrouded in secrecy until June, when, as protests against police brutality spread across the country, the state Legislature in New York repealed a 44-year-old law that had been used to keep them secret.
After a legal challenge from labor unions representing police officers, firefighters and corrections officers whose records were shielded by the law, a federal appeals court Thursday ruled the data could be released while the case continued in court.
The publication of the records, policing experts said, chips away at a legal wall of confidentiality built up by police unions, which for decades have used their political clout to block efforts to make complaints about officers and the punishment they receive public.
Samuel Walker, a professor at the University of Nebraska Omaha who is a leading expert on police accountability, said the data would allow academic researchers and policymakers to identify patterns and problems.
“That provides the fodder for policy changes, and that is terribly important,” he said.
How and whether to disclose police disciplinary records have been contentious topics for decades, and practices vary across the country. States like Delaware have laws keeping the records secret, while others like Florida and Arizona permit the release of some or all records.
The issue has become a major target for reform after Floyd’s killing. The officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, Derek Chauvin, had 18 prior complaints and had been involved in three shootings while on duty.

The Phantom-Limb Democratic Convention

MILWAUKEE — About a dozen demonstrators clustered outside the Wisconsin Center, the vacant shell of the Democratic National Convention — the physical host of a virtual assembly.
“Are those crickets?” a protester wondered during a lull in the megaphone chants.
Yes, they were crickets, audible in the distance at around 7 p.m. Wednesday — actual crickets. Cicadas too, and sea gulls, far-off sirens and the general white noise of a city at dusk.
This is what passes for spectacle in Milwaukee this week, in a pandemic-era pageant defined largely by what is not happening — at least here. Grim steel fences surround the arena, although it’s not clear what they’re protecting; supposedly a control room or studio of some kind inside.
Brigades of masked bike cops occasionally ride by in formation, adding to the mood of a dystopian fortress, fully prepared but with little to do.
“It’s like they’re in this netherworld that is not attached to the normal reality,” said Stephen Perlato, a “protest artist” in from Boulder, Colorado.
He held up one of his hand-painted collages — a kind of gun-and-bullet motif.
“You know when someone has experienced shock or trauma? That is how this feels,” Perlato said. “People seem kind of stunned. It’s hard to put into words.”
He tried metaphors and borrowed one from Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York. The coronavirus, Cuomo said in a virtual speech on Monday night of the convention, is a metaphor for a sickened country, ill-equipped to defend itself and invaded by an alien body.
“So that’s what we have all around us,” Perlato said.
In normal times (how many sentences have begun that way lately?), delegates and donors and dignitaries would be streaming into the arena at this hour with their requisite funny decorated hats (never that “funny,” to be honest). And a state senator from, say, New Hampshire would be irate about being left out of some VIP tent.
In normal times , these convention weeks have a certain build. You sense anticipation growing, from the procedural stuff Monday to the keynote Tuesday to the running mate and spouses and former presidents and, finally, the crescendo of Thursday night, when the presumptive standard-bearer sheds the “presumptive,” assumes the nomination and delivers the acceptance speech. Balloons drop; swirls of confetti and hot takes and parties ensue; and then it’s on to the next spectacle — the big rallies, the debates, the frenzied homestretch and the election itself.
But among all the other things lost to the pandemic — 170,000 lives, chief among them — America has been deprived of its accustomed spectacles and normal rhythms.
What are sports without spectators, graduating without graduations or party conventions without, well, parties?
And what happens when a city spends years and a fortune to become the center of the political universe only to become a metaphor for a locked-down nation?
Every convention presents its own set of lasting images and events, some instantly launched into history (Barack Obama’s keynote in Boston, 2004), some stunning (Obama’s attack on his successor Wednesday night) and others just quirky and subjective (my personal favorite — former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin falling into the Ritz Carlton pool during happy hour in Charlotte, North Carolina, 2012).
Each gathering becomes known by its distinct mood and images. This year is no different, except that the moments occurred elsewhere. Here, it is absence, cancellation and silence — a kind of Zombie Convention
“I seem to be using the word ‘surreal’ a lot,” said Marty Brooks, the CEO of the Wisconsin Center District in Milwaukee, which runs the convention center and many of the scheduled activities around the convention.
The city was proud of its selection for the convention last year, but the months of preparation and excitement gave way to angst when the coronavirus came ashore.
Then came the steady scaling back of plans — moving the convention out of the 17,000-seat Fiserv Forum into the smaller Wisconsin Center next door; the migrating of procedural steps (such as approving the party platform) to email. Delegates were told in June not to come. The city remains the “anchor” for the proceedings, but it’s a light and largely symbolic anchor. The actual vessel has been scattered in a placeless, pixilated matrix of screens across the country — remote Jill Biden from Delaware, virtual calamari from Rhode Island.
What’s left for Milwaukee is a phantom limb version of a convention — the flesh is gone, but you still feel some remnant of its presence.
The Milwaukee pullout culminated early this month with the news that neither former Vice President Joe Biden nor his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, would be traveling here. The last wave of media people, celebrities, hard-core political junkies canceled. Signs and banners came down.
“That decision really knocked the wind out of our sails,” Brooks said.
Sympathy runs deep for the spiffed-up host city. Some say the Democrats should offer Milwaukee a redo in 2024, an easy gesture toward a vital swing state.
“It would be nice,” Brooks said. “But I’ve got too many battle scars in business to think that anything happens because people want to be fair and nice.”
When asked about it, the DNC has been noncommittal.
As for this week, it’s possible to walk around the entire city without knowing a convention is taking place. The rhythm to this “event” is a steady lull. By afternoon’s end, maybe two dozen protesters will show up at the corner of Philips and Wisconsin avenues near the arena: a few from the environmental group, Extinction Rebellion; some Black Lives Matter signs; a guy wearing a “Legalize Cannabis, Dump Trump” sandwich board; and about a half-dozen yellow-vested Sen. Bernie Sanders holdouts.
“The DNC decided they’d rather lose to Trump than have Bernie Sanders be the nominee,” said Jen Hammer of Milwaukee, who vowed not to support Biden in November.
At the very least, the protesters receive much more attention from the skeletal media presence.
“We’re not being drowned out by all the other voices,” said Santiago Edinger, part of a three-person, guitar-strumming contingent that includes his brother and father.
They are protesting against U.S. involvement in Latin America. Driving in from Los Angeles in a 2003 Ford Focus, they got stopped a bunch of times, Edinger said. Someone called the police on them, he said, saying they were exhibiting “druglike behavior.”
For the most part, though, people have been nice, even the Trump supporters.
“We had civil discourse,” Santiago said.
His father, Steven Edinger, stood by, saying he planned to vote in November for Gloria La Riva, the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party. But he was now focused mainly on the drug war in Latin America, particularly Plan Colombia, aimed at combating cartels and insurgent groups in that country.
“It was developed by Bill Clinton, the guy speaking here tonight,” Edinger said Tuesday, pointing to the arena over his shoulder, where Clinton would not be speaking.
“Well, virtually speaking,” Edinger said. “So, I’m pointing, technically, to what was supposed to be.”
Things can get existential, as they have tended to in these scary, solitary months. The country seems to be re-evaluating traditions like political conventions. How will they be different in the future?
How will we be different?
In the meantime, for what it’s worth, Milwaukee looks terrific, and the weather has been cool and sunny. All of which triggers that most universal of existential questions: What could have been?

NEW YORK — More than 323,000 accusations of misconduct against current and former New York City police officers were published online Thursday, a major milestone in a long and contentious political battle to open records of police discipline to public scrutiny.
The records include all civilian complaints filed since 1985 with the city’s independent police watchdog agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board, and closed after an investigation.
Some 81,550 officers — from the rank-and-file to the current commissioner — were named in the complaints. Together they offer the public the broadest look to date at how officers are investigated and punished for a range of offenses, from using profanity and slurs to beating or choking people during arrests.
The complaints were published in an online database by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the records from the review board after state lawmakers repealed a law that had kept them secret.
The civil liberties union noted that less than 3% of the 323,911 complaints resulted in a penalty for officers, 12 of whom had been terminated. Christopher Dunn, the organization’s legal director, said in a statement that the records showed that the Police Department, whose commissioner makes the final decision on disciplinary matters, “is unwilling to police itself.”
“The release of this database is an important step towards greater transparency and accountability,” Dunn added, “and is just the beginning of unraveling the monopoly the NYPD holds on public information and officer discipline.”
Al Baker, a police spokesman, said the department had refined the discipline system and implemented changes recommended by a panel of prosecutors and judges. “All of this advances the NYPD’s priority to make its internal disciplinary system as fair, effective, and transparent as it can,” he said.
Fred Davie, chairman of the review board, said in a statement that the agency released the records in response to demands from the public for greater police accountability, which have been underscored by the nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.
“All New Yorkers have a right to transparency” under the state law granting access to public records, said Davie, who promised that his agency “will hold paramount the people’s right to know how their communities are policed.”
But that might become even more difficult for the review board, which is preparing to possibly lay off staff because of budget cuts brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The Independent Budget Office recently said the review board, which has a $20 million budget and 200-person staff, was too small to oversee the Police Department, which has a $6 billion budget and 36,000 officers.
The records released Thursday include all allegations of excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy and offensive language investigated by the review board though mid-July as well as the board’s findings and any discipline that the police commissioner imposed. They do not include complaints under investigation by the review board or those investigated by the Police Department itself.
The complaints were shrouded in secrecy until June, when, as protests against police brutality spread across the country, the state Legislature in New York repealed a 44-year-old law that had been used to prevent their release to the public.
After a legal challenge from labor unions representing police officers, firefighters and corrections officers whose records were shielded by the law, a federal appeals court Thursday ruled the data could be released while the case continued in a lower court.
The unions vowed to continue fighting against what Hank Sheinkopf, a spokesman for the union coalition, said was “the improper dumping of thousands of documents containing unproven, career-damaging, unsubstantiated allegations that put our members and their families at risk.”
The publication of the records, policing experts said, chips away at a legal wall of confidentiality built up by police unions, which for decades have used their political clout to block efforts to publicly release complaints about officers and the punishment they receive.
Samuel Walker, a professor at the University of Nebraska Omaha who is a leading expert on police accountability, said the data would allow academic researchers and policymakers to identify patterns and problems.
“That provides the fodder for policy changes, and that is terribly important,” he said.
The topic of how and whether to disclose police disciplinary records has been contentious for decades. States like Delaware have laws keeping the records secret, while others like Florida and Arizona permit the release of some or all records, according to the Police Executive Research Forum, a policy and research nonprofit.
“Departments have come to recognize that’s part of what transparency looks like,” Chuck Wexler, the executive director, said.
The records became a lightning-rod issue when Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration fought against disclosing those of Daniel Pantaleo, a police officer who put Eric Garner in a banned chokehold on Staten Island in 2014 that proved fatal.
Pantaleo was fired last year, but the law the city relied on to shield his records did not change until this past June, after the death of Floyd.
The records released Thursday add to a patchwork of data about police misconduct in New York City created by media and legal organizations.
ProPublica published data on nearly 4,000 officers who had at least one allegation of misconduct substantiated after an investigation, and BuzzFeed in 2018 published leaked records of 1,800 cases. The Legal Aid Society also maintains a database of federal lawsuits against officers.
Most people who have unpleasant encounters with the police do not file formal complaints. For many whose formal complaints have been substantiated by the review board, the publication of the records offers an opportunity to finally learn what punishment, if any, those officers received.
And for those who are facing criminal charges based on officers’ testimony or who have filed lawsuits against the city accusing police of misconduct and abuse, the records make it easier to learn more about an officer’s history.
Richard Emery, a former chairman of the review board, said the data provided a treasure trove for researchers and policymakers, who can use the information to discern patterns and then recommend or mandate changes to how the department deals with problematic officers and troubling trends.
But the release of the records also puts pressure on the Police Department to change how unsubstantiated claims affect officers’ careers, he said. Even if not proven true, misconduct complaints can have a negative effect on officers’ opportunities for transfers, promotions and more desirable assignments.
“It’s a very, very complicated, messy problem that has a lot of strings to it,” Emery said. “The release of these statistics and information can be something that’s useful, and it can support reform, but it also can be something that undermines reform and puts the police in the position where they cannot and will not do their job.”
The police unions have argued in court that no information about misconduct cases should be released in which the police commissioner has not ended up handing down punishment. But the repeal of the secrecy law, known as 50-a, “made clear that disciplinary records can now be made available to the public,” James E. Johnson, the city’s corporation counsel, said in a statement Thursday.
The unions’ argument would have prevented the release of the vast majority of the review board’s data. Only in 8,699 of the more than 300,000 cases did officers receive any disciplinary action, according to the civil liberties union. The penalties can range from a letter in their personnel file to suspension or firing, according to the review board.
Reasons for this vary, but the majority of civilian complaints end because investigators did not have enough evidence to determine what actually happened or found evidence to disprove the allegations, or the person filing the complaint withdrew from the investigation.
The Police Department often withholds some evidence, including body camera footage. The review board has said cases in which there is video are more likely to be substantiated.
Kate Levine, a criminal law professor at Yeshiva University, said the data should not be used to “name and shame” officers but to understand how policing is in need of fundamental change. “Let’s get rid of the worst people first,” she said, “but also let’s take those dollars and reinvest them in the many different ways that we can better the lives of marginalized communities.”

MARGATE, England — When artists Kelly Abbott and Victoria Barrow Williams heard that the Turner Contemporary Gallery was hosting an exhibition focused on art associated with the civil rights movement in the American South, they felt confused.
“We thought they missed a trick by making it so Americanized,” Abbott said in an interview. “There’s a rich Black British history here.”
So the two, who are also the directors of People Dem Collective, a Margate-based group that supports Black and brown people across Britain, approached the museum with an idea for an additional exhibit to accompany “We Will Walk — Art and Resistance in the American South.” Their idea would resonate more with the artists’ experiences as Black British women.
The resulting one-room exhibit, “Margate to Minneapolis,” features more than 100 signs carried by protesters at local Black Lives Matter marches that the People Dem Collective organized in June after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
“We Will Walk” — which covers four rooms and includes 110 works — pairs photos and music from the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s with work by Black artists in Alabama and other Southern states during that period and in the decades following. Another installment, “Place, Space and Who,” features five large portraits of Black women and girls living in the Margate area, drawn onto the gallery’s walls by British artist Barbara Walker.
On view at the gallery until Sept. 6, the exhibitions offer diverse responses to continuing debates about how Britons view and understand both Blackness and the works of Black artists, at a moment when Britain is considering its history of colonialism and slavery.
It remains uncommon to see exhibitions devoted to works by Black artists in a mainstream gallery space like the Turner: Walker’s commission is the fourth in the museum’s nine-year history to spotlight the work of a single Black artist.
When the Turner Contemporary Gallery closed in March because of the coronavirus, so did both “We Will Walk,” which originally opened in February, and “Place, Space and Who,” which opened in September. By the time the museum reopened, July 22, work was already underway on the installation of “Margate to Minneapolis,” which opened Aug. 1. Abbott and Barrow Williams had proposed the idea for the exhibit only a few weeks earlier.
The museum, which opened in 2011, is credited with hastening the recent regeneration of Margate, a poor seaside town that in previous centuries was a favorite with British vacationers.
With “Margate to Minneapolis,” Abbott and Barrow Williams wanted to highlight the efforts of the recent Black Lives Matter protests in Margate and nearby towns and to encourage visitors to actively fight against systemic racism.
Many of the handmade signs — which hang from the ceiling, echoing the way protesters held them aloft — point to Britain’s history of anti-Black racism, emblazoned with slogans like “The U.K. is not innocent” and “Built on racism” next to the British flag. A video projected onto a wall shows footage from the marches, and a large banner nearby lists the names of Black people killed by the police in Britain.
On entry to the room, visitors are invited to put a sticker onto a poster indicating whether they would visit a local cultural center if it offered opportunities to learn more about Black and brown people in British history. People Dem Collective is raising money to open just such a cultural center on Margate’s seafront.
“Art is often a vehicle for social progress,” Barrow Williams said, adding that the Turner exhibit “shows the power of protest.”
“We Will Walk” also speaks to broad themes of resistance, but on a different continent. Freeman Vines’ carved wooden guitars, some made from a North Carolina tree where Black people were lynched, are on display, as are a collection of quilts made by Black women in Gee’s Bend, Alabama, an isolated hamlet where many of the quilters’ ancestors were enslaved.
The exhibition also features photos taken by British artist Hannah Collins of other works by Black artists from the American South. Collins, who is white, co-curated “We Will Walk” with British curator and researcher Paul Goodwin, who is Black.
Collins says she hopes that staging a British exhibition featuring art associated with the U.S. civil rights movement will help Britain deal with its own racist past.
“There’s a shared past in slavery; there’s a shared past in oppression,” she said in an interview. “If that history isn’t put together in any way, it doesn’t do anyone any good.”
Yet Walker said she wasn’t engaging in an act of protest when she drew the charcoal and chalk portraits that stretch up the walls of the gallery’s lobby. “The space I seek to reclaim is that of visibility,” she said. “With visibility comes worth, and with worth comes humanity.”
The drawings are accompanied by online audio of the sitters discussing their feelings of both belonging and marginalization in Margate, a majority-white town. In depicting real Black women and girls, Walker said she was looking to redress the dominance of whiteness in both Western art history and mainstream British history.
But the impulse to automatically call works by Black or female artists “political” limits the possible interpretations of a work, Walker says. For female artists of color like her, this presents dual difficulties.
“I personally feel that much of my career as an artist has been spent resisting the boxes that the art world wants to put me in,” she said.
Many artists have contested the tendency of art critics and the public to recognize the work of Black artists principally as tools of protest. Frank Bowling, a Guyana-born artist who has lived in the London district of Pimlico for more than five decades, has said that he moved to New York in the mid-1960s partly because in Britain his identity as a “Caribbean artist” had come with confining expectations.
“It seemed that everyone was expecting me to paint some kind of protest art out of post-colonial discussion,” he told The Guardian in 2012.
The genre known as protest art became prominent in mainstream discussions after the British Black arts movement, which was birthed by a generation of young Black artists in the 1980s who addressed anti-Black racism and Black feminism in their work. This included a group of British Afro-Caribbean art students northwest of London, who formed what became known as the BLK Art Group.
“We were all interested in how you make an art practice that is responsive to political ideas,” said Keith Piper, one of its founding members.
But members sparred over how explicitly political their work should be, according to Piper and Marlene Smith, another member.
“It’s important for me to make work that speaks to the times that I live in, but I wouldn’t want to describe my work as protest art,” Smith said, adding that it wasn’t about “negating something.”
Walker echoed these sentiments.
“I don’t make ‘protest art,’ ” she said. “I make art.”
For the People Dem Collective, creating art as a form of protest can encourage support for the Black Lives Matter movement and disrupt the hegemonic whiteness that has traditionally dominated both the Turner and the British art world.
“To be able to have protest within that art exhibition — within that institution,” Barrow Williams said, “is huge.”

Senators Lead an Increasingly Diverse Nation. Their Top Aides Are Mostly White.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — As senators chart a response to a deadly pandemic and an economic crisis that have disproportionately hurt Black Americans and other people of color, the top aides leading their offices are overwhelmingly white — far more so than the country as a whole.
Just 11% of top staff members in senators’ Washington offices — the key aides who draft legislation, coordinate public communications and vet nominees for executive branch posts and lifetime judgeships — are people of color, according to a new study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that pushes for greater racial diversity in government. By comparison, close to 40% of Americans are people of color, and 9% of senators.
Of the 100 members of the Senate, 72 — including Republicans and Democrats representing states with large minority populations, like Texas, Maryland, Georgia, Florida and Arizona — did not employ a single person of color as one of their top personal aides when researchers made their initial tallies in January 2020. Only four, all Democrats, employed more than one such top aide, defined by the study as chiefs of staff, legislative directors and communications directors in senators’ personal offices in Washington.
“People of color are underrepresented in various occupations, but a lack of diversity among top Senate staff warrants special attention because Senate decisions affect everyone in the nation,” LaShonda Brenson, the lead researcher, wrote in an introduction to the coming study, which was shared with The New York Times in advance of its release.
“The lack of racial diversity among top staff is not a partisan issue but a challenge that the Senate — as an institution — must address,” she added.
The report showed that the chamber’s top aides have grown slightly more diverse since 2015, the last time the group conducted a similar study in the Senate and found that 7.1% of top staff members in personal offices were people of color. The percentage of top aides who are Black increased most rapidly, to 3.1% this year from less than 1% in 2015, though that figure is still far below the 13.4% of Americans who are Black.
Other groups saw more modest gains or even declines since 2015. Researchers found that 3.8% of top Senate staff members were Latino, compared with 18.5% of the total population and 2.4% in 2015; 2.7% were Asian American or Pacific Islander, compared with 6.1% of the total population and 3.7% of top staff members in 2015. Smaller numbers were identified as biracial or Middle Eastern and North African.
As of January, researchers did not find a single Native American who filled one of the top positions in any senator’s personal office.
Omitted from these tallies are state directors, often senators’ top aides on the ground at home; committee staff members; or staff aides working in Democratic and Republican leadership offices, which wield considerable power. Brenson said analysis of those positions would be forthcoming. Several deputy chiefs of staff are people of color, but not all senators employ someone in that position, so researchers did not include it in the full study.
Of the 99 chiefs of staff counted by the study, only eight were people of color — four African Americans, three Latinos and one Asian American or Pacific Islander. Slightly more legislative directors, 14, were people of color, as were 10 communications directors.
The Times did not independently verify all the data, which was based on employment records of senators’ personal offices captured in January 2020.
Leaders for nonpartisan staff associations representing congressional aides of color said those numbers simply were not good enough and urged lawmakers to accelerate the empowering of minority staff members to live up to the values they profess in floor speeches and campaigns.
“The glaring lack of diversity among senior staff in the Senate should serve as a wake-up call to everyone,” said Jonathan Carter, president of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus.
Alice Lin and Liz Lee, the leaders of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association, said they were “alarmed and disappointed by the dramatic decrease in the percentage of Asian American and Pacific Islander staffers.” Christine Godinez, president of the Congressional Hispanic Staff Association, lamented that the Senate workforce still lacked “diversity at every level five years later — especially at the top.”
And Didier Barjon, president of the Congressional Black Associates, argued that the numbers had clear policy implications.
“If there are more Black staffers in senior-level roles, we would have a better opportunity to address the current pandemic, as well as long-standing issues that disproportionately affect our communities,” he said.
In an interview, Brenson agreed that the paucity of aides of color had only become a more urgent problem since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic in the winter and the mass protests against police brutality and systemic racism that erupted in May. COVID-19 has disproportionately infected and killed Black and Latino Americans, and in many cases, those same groups have been hit the hardest by the economic recession it spawned.
Having top advisers who can broaden lawmakers’ perspectives about how different racial and ethnic communities are affected can help lead to policy responses that better serve all Americans, Brenson argued.
“If there were more diverse staff that could speak to senators about potential blind spots that may occur in the legislation, I think the legislation would be more responsive to the needs of minority communities,” she said.
She pointed to the Paycheck Protection Program, one of the pillars of the $2.2 trillion economic relief package Congress passed in March. The program has been popular and disbursed billions of dollars propping up small businesses, but studies have shown that minority-owned businesses, and especially Black-owned businesses, have struggled to secure the loans, a policy failure that could decimate Black businesses and communities that rely on them.
Congress’ hiring decisions also ripple well beyond Capitol Hill. House and Senate offices serve as pipelines to Washington’s major power centers: the White House, executive branch agencies, lobbying firms and nongovernmental organizations, as well as state governments.
Top staff members in the House of Representatives are somewhat more diverse.
A 2018 study by the Joint Center found that 13.7% of top staff members in the House were people of color. After Democrats reclaimed control of the House in 2019, ushering in the most racially diverse Congress in history, the group updated its tallies and found that the figure had risen to nearly 21%.
In the Senate, Democrats are significantly more likely to employ a top aide of color. Racial minorities made up only 4% of top staff members for Republican senators, compared with 19% for Democrats.
In recent years, Senate Democrats have undertaken a diversity initiative meant to help recruit, vet and retain a pool of candidates for job openings in the Senate. They have also instituted a rule asking Democratic offices to interview at least one minority candidate for each job opening.
The caucus releases its own statistics on the racial makeup of all staff aides working for each Democratic senator and the party’s committee offices. In 2020, the percentages of staff members who identify as nonwhite ranged from just 8% in the office of Sen. Jon Tester of Montana to 65% in the office of Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. But the caucus does not indicate who fills which roles, making it difficult to discern the kinds of roles people of color are filling.
Alex Nguyen, a spokesman for the Democratic leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, said the caucus was “working to increase that diversity on all levels.”
Senate Republicans have no comparable initiative and do not publicly share staff statistics. A spokesman for Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, declined to comment on the report.

NEW YORK — New York City, one of the most demographically diverse places on the planet, is also home to one of the most segregated school districts in America. That contrast has rattled New York’s self-image and given rise to major integration efforts over the past several years. Most have failed. And across America, desegregation has never been tried at scale, partly because of resistance from white liberals.
Inspired by the release of a new podcast from Serial and The New York Times, “Nice White Parents,” we brought together a panel of five experts to discuss the obstacles to integration in New York and elsewhere, and the ways some people are beginning to reconsider its value and focus on empowering Black and Latino parents who have so often been left out of the debate about their own children’s educations.
We asked: Why is integration a talking point, but not yet a political priority, in such a proudly liberal city? What does research tell us about why integration works, and what does history reveal about why it so rarely succeeds? And will this moment of profound societal upheaval actually change anything about how our schools work?
The Participants
— Dana Goldstein is a national education correspondent for The New York Times.
— Tiffani Torres is a rising college freshman at Georgetown University and a recent graduate of Pace High School in Manhattan.
— Richard Buery is the president of Achievement First, a network of charter schools in the Northeast.
— Chana Joffe-Walt is a reporter and producer at This American Life and the host of “Nice White Parents,” a new podcast from Serial and The New York Times.
— Sonya Douglass Horsford is a professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College.
Goldstein: There’s a robust and growing body of research that pretty conclusively demonstrates the benefits of integration. We have known since the 1960s that Black and Latino students who attend integrated schools with a significant white population have more access to the arts, to newer textbooks, to better extracurricular opportunities.
We also know that when it comes to academic achievement, high school graduation rates, lower participation in the criminal justice system, and also adult earnings, those low-income students and students of color who attended integrated schools generally have better outcomes on every single one of those measures, while white and middle-class students who attend integrated schools generally do not experience adverse effects.
Indeed, there’s really interesting sociological research on the benefit to white and middle-class students of attending schools that are more racially and economically diverse. It appears to have a real long-term impact on their social beliefs, their tolerance toward diversity, their willingness to live in more diverse neighborhoods and their excitement about sending their own children to integrated schools.
Douglass Horsford: I would say most people really do support and want integrated schools. But we haven’t been able to maintain integrated schools because you really have to want integration to succeed and be willing to give something up to achieve success.
So while there has been extensive research documenting the points that Dana made about some of the benefits in terms of achievement outcomes as a result of proximity to whiteness, I just don’t know that form of integration or that evidence speaks to the ways in which desegregated spaces can create hostile environments for children of color. We’re seeing increased evidence of such hostility in the current moment.
Buery: Something I’ve heard my wife say, which resonates for me, is that the tools we use to attack segregation are so much smaller than the tools we used to build it. So it’s not so much that desegregation has ever failed; it’s that we’ve never really tried.
If you look over the 100-year history of our country, during the long period, even after Brown vs. Board of Education, nothing really happened other than in Little Rock itself and a few other towns.
So you could just compare this 20 years or so in American history of limited desegregation efforts, and you compare that to 400 years of Black people in America. Desegregation has failed because America has not really tried. And the reason why no one in America has really tried is because, I think, the majority of Americans are not actually interested in integration.
They fear sending their children to school with Black and Latino children, or because they fear sharing resources with those students, and/or because they view education essentially as a zero-sum game and worry that, “If I do something that expands opportunity for some other kid, my child may suffer in their access to privilege or access to opportunities or access to resources.” And most humans are not willing to risk their own children for their values and ideals.
Shapiro: Dana, can you describe some of the things you learned when reporting about resistance to integration in places like Montgomery County, Maryland, and San Francisco?
Goldstein: A busing plan in suburban Baltimore, a plan to allow more Black and Latino students to access gifted and talented education in Montgomery County, Maryland, and a choice system for schools in San Francisco were supposed to magically lead to integration. But, in fact, they led to neighborhoods that were more integrated than the schools in them. As you know, white and Asian families used the choice system to avoid the school down the block and instead cluster in a small group of coveted schools.
My conclusion was similar to one of the points Chana makes in the podcast, which is that accidental integration is not a type of integration that’s very likely to work for Black and brown and low-income children. Because white and privileged parents who go into diverse spaces without believing that it is important to be part of an equal, diverse community of parents and students end up trying to mold these schools to the benefit of their own kids above all others. And it just happens again and again.
Shapiro: Rich, can you speak briefly about what it was like to be one of the very few Black students at Stuyvesant High School, a specialized school in New York City, back in the early 1980s?
Buery: I went to middle school in Bushwick, which is an exam school which served entirely Black and Latino students at the time. Going to Stuyvesant was a culture shock for me. Remember, this was the 1980s, so Stuyvesant, although it was not diverse by any stretch, was significantly more diverse than it is now. There were many more Black and Latino students than there are now.
It was a deeply disorienting experience from a lens of race, from a lens of class. I still to this day struggle with some of the anxiety that I developed, the impostor syndrome, the stereotype threat, which I think were all sparked at Stuyvesant. And the microaggressions from people today, who I consider my friends, who asked me, do I think I got into Harvard because of affirmative action? I still carry these things with me.
There was no effort at Stuyvesant to think about what it would be like for a Black kid from East New York to come to that school, and to make sure that it was a truly integrated environment that supported members of all races. The fact of the matter is that in this city, it’s always integration on white people’s terms.
I know that so much of who I am and where I’ve gotten in life comes from the privilege of attending Stuyvesant, the way it prepared me academically, the way it educated me about the world, the way it launched me into elite private college education. At the same time, it would be hard to describe an experience as a reaffirming experience.
For me it represents a foundational failure of our city. Specialized high schools are just emblematic of the extreme version of a systemic problem. Why did our city continue to rely so deeply on admissions requirements like grades and tests for competitive schools when we know the discriminatory impact they have? It can only be because we don’t think that Black students and Latino students are as smart as other students, that they deserve as much as other students.
Goldstein: I was part of a desegregation program and was bused in a town in the Hudson Valley called Ossining, New York. And all through my teenage years and into college, I considered it to be one of the most positive and powerful aspects of my life. I really strongly identified as a white person who benefited from attending an integrated school, through exposure to people whose backgrounds were not similar to mine, through having a more diverse group of friends.
When I became an education reporter, however, I reflected a lot on how poorly integration had worked for so many of my classmates of color. We were a town that had a very large Black and Latino population, and yet the advanced placement college track that I was on was overwhelmingly white. I had maybe two Black teachers my entire education. I don’t think I had any Latino teachers.
So I think anyone who immerses themselves for years in these questions is going to come out with a much more nuanced perspective on it. But I do ultimately still find the empirical evidence in support of integration really compelling.
Douglass Horsford: It wasn’t until I began studying desegregation when I really became interested in my own educational experience and being bused in the sixth grade. And so here in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, we have the fifth-largest school district in the country but a very small African American population. In 1968, the NAACP challenged the Clark County School District for maintaining intentionally segregated schools, in Kelly v. Mason. And the court found in favor of the NAACP.
But then it required this very small population of Black students to be bused to other parts of the county, into west Las Vegas. And it required that other students, white students predominantly — I was included in that because I lived outside of west Las Vegas — to be bused into the historic African American community for one year.
But I never really viewed my experience as negative. I had a diverse group of friends based on where I stayed. I had exposure and experiences with individuals whose background was different than mine. We also shared a lot of things in common. And I feel that, in this moment, rather than focus on the things that we do share in common, we are so obsessed and focused on the things that differentiate us.
Shapiro: Tiffani, you had excellent grades in middle school. You then applied to Eleanor Roosevelt High School, a selective school on the Upper East Side that has a geographic preference for admission. But you didn’t meet that preference since you live far from Manhattan, in Brownsville, a mostly low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn. How did you feel about getting rejected from what was at one time your dream school?
Torres: I believed the process had been advertised to me as open choice, where if I worked hard throughout middle school and got good grades — and I did — then there was no reason why I shouldn’t be able to attend any of the schools in the city. That’s what I thought.
And then I didn’t get a seat at any specialized high school. I did not understand a lot of the material that was on the test at all. My parents kind of saw it as, “OK, she gets good grades, so she’s prepared for anything that the school system has to throw at her.” But I realized that that wasn’t the case.
I am a first-generation student. I’m Dominican Latina. My parents came here in the ’70s, in a very different time. And so they have very different views than I do on integration and what it means to be a first-generation student in the school system and what it means to go to schools that are majority Black and Hispanic.
What they saw was that white people didn’t live in our communities. But white people were successful. And they were more fearful of my future than I was because they saw that. Because I wasn’t in spaces where white people lived or where they went to school, they worried I wouldn’t be successful.
But I’m very glad that I didn’t go to Eleanor Roosevelt. I remember a few years ago a student was handed a tampon with the N-word written across it. She was, I think, one of the only Black students in her grade. And the school itself is majority white students. I have never gone to a school that wasn’t majority Black and Latinx students or where there wasn’t a majority of students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch like me.
Shapiro: It is notable, as Tiffani has pointed out, that Mayor Bill de Blasio has mostly avoided using the word segregation to describe the state of New York City schools, which we know are, in fact, segregated. He has instead used the word diversity.
Chana, can you tell us how you’ve come to understand the difference between integration and diversity, equality and equity?
Joffe-Walt: One thing that I really came away with from even just the first year I spent reporting in the school, where the school saw this huge influx of advantaged white families in a single year, was just how limited our language is or how intentionally imprecise our language is in talking about integration. Within that school year, diversity was used to describe what was happening to the school — that this large group of white families was coming in, and it was becoming a diverse community.
But that word seemed a stand-in meaning different things to different people. So you would hear white families talking about wanting to be part of a diverse school. For them, diverse seemed to describe the fact that the school had Black and Latinx kids in it. Families of color would describe all of the diversity coming in, referring to the white kids. Some were excited this would mean more resources coming to the school. Others saw it as a threat that their school would be taken over.
I think there was also a lack of clarity when the school was being planned in the early 1960s in the middle of the school integration movement in New York City. The schools were de facto segregated. But the Board of Ed would not say the word segregation because, I think, segregation implied intent and also responsibility. So if the schools were segregated, then it was the fault of the institution that runs the schools and the responsibility of that institution to fix it. So the Board of Ed would talk about racial imbalance or racial separation.
Integration advocates and Black and Puerto Rican parents and organizers then talked about integration as a tool to access all of the things that white kids in the city already had access to — to experienced teachers, to reasonable class sizes and functioning toilets. And the Board of Ed instead talked about this idea of coming together in racial harmony and that integration was not a remedy for injustice. They were using the word the way that we use the word diversity today.
So I think that you can see that even back in the 1960s, Black parents really talked about integration as a means to an end. But the Board of Ed and white parents talked about integration as a virtue in and of itself.
Shapiro: That brings me to a foundational question: Who is integration actually for? Do we have diverse schools to make white people feel less guilty? Or do we have integration to dismantle structures of systemic racism that have excluded Black and Latino kids from having access to all that public education can offer them?
Douglass Horsford: I think the integration conversation is more of a conversation that’s happening among those who enjoy some level of privilege: nice white parents. Where is the groundswell of pro-integration efforts and support led by Black and other disenfranchised communities? I just don’t see it coming from the families that integration is supposed to benefit.
Integration is no longer the most important issue for Black families. Today, Black parents are worried about whether or not their children will be safe — whether because of COVID or violence on campuses or hate crimes or police brutality. In this moment, talking about integration feels like such a distraction.
Joffe-Walt: When I began the podcast, I took the need for school integration as a given. I thought of it both from my own perspective, with some sentimental ideas about the benefits of diversity, and wanting that for my own children. I also thought integration seems like an obvious goal because of the empirical evidence we’ve discussed. But also, segregation is anathema to the American promise. Separating people by races is caste. So it seemed like integration was an obvious good.
I think that what has changed for me is that I walked through the history of a school where integration has been invoked over and over again as a virtue and used as a reason to pursue policies and programs that benefit white parents, that benefit advantaged parents — and that didn’t actually shift power within the school. After that, I started to have some doubts.
There were so many ways in which the school system and white parents maintained segregation in the school by creating separate academic tracks, by clustering in certain schools or by hoarding resources. And I was especially struck by how this was true when white families were inside of the school I profiled during that first episode.
So I think it is more important to talk about race and power in more explicit terms and to talk about this history. I think people like me need to reckon with what our legacy is with public schools and to really question what we mean when we say that we are striving to achieve integration, or diversity, or whatever word we use.
Shapiro: Rich, you oversaw an initiative when you were at City Hall to try to get more Black male teachers into city schools. I know at KIPP and at Achievement First, you have really put an emphasis on having a staff that looks like the kids that they serve. Why is it important for Black students to have Black teachers?
Buery: When I was at City Hall, about 40% of our students were Black or Latino males and about 8% of our teachers were Black and Latino males. I had only two Black male teachers during my entire public education career, both in middle school.
Over the last few years, we’ve seen really compelling research around the positive impact that having even one teacher of color can have on the educational trajectory of Black students — and also how few young people actually have exposure to Black teachers, particularly male teachers of color.
But there are all sorts of barriers, including regulatory barriers such as teacher licensing exams in many states that disproportionately exclude people of color, even though there is little or no evidence that your score on those exams impacts the quality of instruction.
Shapiro: I wanted to dig into this question about what we talk about when we talk about resources. In a lot of ways we’re talking about fundraising and the power that comes with fundraising prowess. We know that schools across New York City, for example, have radically different PTA annual fundraising totals every year.
Dana has written about this idea of pooling PTA donations across schools and districts and had a wonderful story a few years ago about the controversy such pooling set off in Southern California. Some parents said they did not want their donations going to other children’s schools. Can you talk about what you found there and whether you think the idea might have a shot in other places?
Goldstein: The depressing thing is that in Santa Monica and Malibu, which is the district that attempted the PTA pooling, it sort of added fuel to the fire of this simmering movement for the Malibu part of the district, which is the whiter, wealthier part, to secede, essentially. And we’ve seen these secession movements across the country.
So I don’t know how hopeful I am that it can be done without an enormous amount of controversy in other places as well. But I was impressed with some of the concrete and pragmatic things I saw that the pool donation system was able to accomplish.
It purchased things like a beautiful arts program, a drama program, a telescope for astronomy for the students. It was something they were able to do because the overall district was diverse even though there was still some segregation within the school buildings themselves and across the building. We’re largely talking about a program that was intended to benefit low-income Latino families and the schools their children attended.
I think it would be enormously controversial in New York City. When I looked at the data on the richest PTAs in the country, a lot of them are in places like the Upper West Side, the Upper East Side, the Village, brownstone Brooklyn. So telling those parents that some certain percentage of what you give will not be for your kid’s school is going to be enormously controversial here.
Shapiro: I’d be remiss not to ask about the rise of these home-schooling pods. We are hearing a lot of anecdotes about white families with means who believe their children should not have to suffer through another year of remote learning. And they are getting together and, in some cases, taking their kids out of the public school system, possibly hiring teachers away from the public school system.
And it strikes me that these pods, even if they are a small trend, tell us a fair amount about how accidental segregation happens by well-meaning people who just don’t want their kids to lose out.
Douglass Horsford: As a parent, I think parents are going to do what they think is in the best interest of their kids. I don’t believe that investing in strategies that will try to change their behavior around that is going to work.
I mean, just to be honest, in the culture that we live in, it’s about individualism. It’s about getting the upper hand. You have people writing letters for kindergarten students in New York City to get into a kindergarten program. So I think we just have to be realistic about that — the culture that we live in — and what history has shown us.
But I think the question for me is, how should parents who may not have the means but have the wherewithal can create their own educational networks and communities to help them during the pandemic — and beyond. So that’s what I’ve been giving thought to — and to how educators and community organizations could be working directly with parents and families to meet those needs.
The focus needs to be shifting, for those who are focused on justice, from equity to emancipation. That means for students of color, for immigrant students, for others who have been marginalized in the U.S. school system to recognize the system that they’re in and to begin to think about ways to liberate themselves from that.
Shapiro: We are in the midst of this huge reckoning over race and justice. And we don’t really know how this movement is going to trickle down to schools. To wrap up, I would love everyone to talk about whether you feel any optimism that this sort of reckoning could change anything about how or whether school districts work for equity.
Joffe-Walt: I was reading something the other day about how every article about reopening schools reaches a point where it talks about the need for federal funds and for investment and that we are all really failed by the lack of planning and investment and coordination across all of our public systems. We’re all harmed by the lack of investment in public institutions. I am not very hopeful that it is going to go in the direction of more equitable schools.
We are all harmed by the lack of investment in public institutions, but we are not all harmed in the same way. We don’t all have the same options available to us when it comes to filling in gaps where our public systems fail. If we have no collective response to this crisis, and if we don’t demand leadership and robust public institutions, then yes, inequities will get worse.
Goldstein: When I was watching the George Floyd protests, I was noticing that many of the white neighborhoods where a lot of white liberals were out participating in Black Lives Matter demonstrations were some of the same neighborhoods that resisted school integration. And that filled me with a lot of despair. I am not sure when those people on the street are going to grapple with resistance to policies like integrating schools and building affordable housing.
I then had to cover the news that tens of millions of the nation’s children are going to be learning online in the fall. And that led many of my peers and so many socioeconomically privileged parents of all races to talk about fleeing the public system into so-called learning pods or to embrace the idea that if you pay a private school tuition, you might be more likely to get in-person education this year. So when I consider all of these things, I don’t feel particularly hopeful.
I do, however, think that some of the families that are participating in segregating practices, like the whole private podding thing, are at least talking about and acknowledging the impact of their decisions. That’s a step forward from where we may have been a year ago, before the pandemic and before George Floyd.
Buery: I guess I’m of two minds here. Other than the pandemic itself, the crises that we face today are not really new. Racial oppression is obviously not new, including in schools, which were in so many ways designed to be the instruments of oppression. And public health has been a crisis for Black people for generations.
So on the one hand, I’m not hopeful. Historically, just because there was a big dislocation doesn’t usually resolve to the benefit of people without power. It’s not like we got more wealth equality after the ’08 financial crisis.
But on the other hand, I also realize that all the great changes in our society probably seemed impossible on the other side of the change. I think hope is a discipline. Because hope is a fuel that keeps you working. So I think I am hopeful. But I think you wake up every morning and you force yourself to be hopeful.
And I will say one last thing that gives me fuel. Not to put her on the spot, but it’s people like Tiffani. When I go out and see marches, it’s really the energy of young people who have been at the forefront of every movement for social change in this country and who are in the forefront of this movement.
Torres: Thank you, Richard. I feel like I’m just getting started. And there have been a lot of disappointments, I think, especially this year.
I’m going one day to be in a position where I can change something. And I think that I’m not necessarily hopeful in the sense that I think everything will change overnight, because obviously, that won’t happen. I know that there are going to be a lot of people who oppose the movement for racial and educational equity.
But I’m hopeful in the sense that I think that there will be progress. I’m hopeful because I know that I can change something. And I’ve seen that already happening — not just with myself but also with other students whose experiences are currently being elevated.
Douglass Horsford: Well, I’m very hopeful, actually. And I think it’s because I’ve been beating this drum for a minute. And I feel like the consciousness is changing around these issues.
I’m also very encouraged by the work of young people like Tiffani and even my children, and by just seeing how this moment has ignited their activism and their boldness. They’re just not going to put up with things in ways that even I did.
I think that we just need to make sure that we’re really supporting young people and giving them the tools and the space and the resources to engage in that activism, and that we continue to really focus on resources and representation. But we’ve got to also go back to the political space, the political dimension of all of this, and make sure that we are engaging in political participation, voting, electing people who share our commitment to equity and justice, and support them in doing their work. And with that we will get through this.

WASHINGTON — Deploying a little-known National Guard reconnaissance plane in four U.S. cities to monitor protests this spring did not violate rules against the military collecting intelligence on citizens, a Pentagon report has concluded.
But the report by the Air Force inspector general found that National Guard officials failed to obtain prior approval from Defense Secretary Mark Esper to use the planes because they mistakenly believed they were not intelligence aircraft, which require high-level signoff.
The inquiry was prompted by lawmakers who expressed concerns to Pentagon officials that the use of the aircraft, RC-26B surveillance planes, in late May and early June may have violated the civil liberties of the mostly peaceful protesters demonstrating against police brutality and systemic racism.
Esper responded by ordering an investigation, which was conducted by Lt. Gen. Sami Said, the Air Force inspector general. The Air Force’s action came after the Pentagon’s top intelligence policy official told Congress that the nation’s military intelligence agencies did not spy on American protesters during the wave of nationwide demonstrations.
The Air Force investigation into the use of the RC-26B aircraft in Washington, Minneapolis, Phoenix and El Dorado Hills, California, determined that the planes were used to gather information about crowd size, movements of protesters and cars, threats to buildings and fires but that they did not monitor individuals.
“There was no personal information collected on these missions,” the report found. “The sensors on the aircraft were not capable of identifying any distinguishing features of people or other potentially identifying characteristics such as race or gender.”
None of the aircraft flying over the cities carried equipment that could collect information from cellphones or hand-held radios, the report concluded.
Thousands of National Guard troops were used to assist local law enforcement in several cities around the country during the protests. But the Air Force report highlighted how Pentagon policies about the approval and use of the secretive RC-26B aircraft were vague, were misunderstood by military planners on the ground and needed to be fixed.
In Phoenix, for instance, National Guard planners working with police described how the aircraft could be used “to deter planned/unplanned demonstrations, protests or looting.”
“Properly approved missions can support civilian law enforcement, but there is no scenario in which it is acceptable or permissible to use DOD assets to deter demonstrations and protests, assuming they remain lawful,” the report concluded, referring to the Department of Defense.
“The missions were not used to track individuals, but there was a risk they could have been,” the report said.
The RC-26B, a twin-engine aircraft outfitted for electronic surveillance, is most often used along the southwestern border to monitor illegal immigration and to counter drug smuggling in the Caribbean, as well as in disasters to assess damage and help locate civilians.
But during the protests, the planes conducted the first-of-its-kind missions to support law enforcement authorities on the ground.
On the morning of June 2, hours after National Guard helicopters harassed crowds of protesters in Washington, National Guard officials informed their commanders that the West Virginia Air National Guard had sent an RC-26B to help observe the protests with “FMV capabilities” — or full-motion video — according to a message viewed by The New York Times.
According to one military official familiar with the situation, senior National Guard leaders in Washington could watch the footage recorded from the aircraft on their cellphones in real time. This most likely meant that the RC-26B would circle overhead and beam video to the FBI command center near the Chinatown area of Washington.
RC-26B pilots said the plane’s onboard camera is powerful enough to determine the general image of an individual as the three-member crew flies at altitudes of 4,000 to 20,000 feet. But the cameras are not strong enough or sophisticated enough to use for facial recognition or to read license plates on vehicles, they said.
Despite the planes’ extensive surveillance abilities, the Air Force report found that military commanders did not consider the RC-26B an intelligence aircraft, which would require more senior approval for the use of the plane and stricter guidance on the missions.
The use of the planes was not approved by Esper, an Army veteran who also once served in the District of Columbia National Guard, because officials did not believe that was required. But the report concluded the defense secretary should have had the final word over those types of delicate missions to prevent the military from using its vast arsenal for law enforcement purposes without proper oversight.
In the end, the report concluded, that did not happen, at least in the case of the seven RC-26B flights. “There is no evidence individuals or specific organizations were targeted, followed or identified,” the report said.
The Air Force report did not examine the use of National Guard helicopters to harass protesters by hovering over them, creating a deafening roar and blasting the crowd with rotor wash.

At dinner tables, chatter keeps turning to the treatment of Black Americans. In living rooms, U.S. history becomes fodder for debate.
And on social media, difficult conversations across generations — long held privately — are now playing out in public, as many young Americans talk to their parents and older relatives about racism, police violence and protests around the world, and then post about it.
As demonstrations in some cities push through a third month, many teenagers have kept conversations going at home. Some are creating and sharing Google Docs with resources like reading lists and videos. And some are trying to reach their relatives through sites like Facebook — occasionally at the risk of stirring up acrimony in their family.
When social media starts the conversation
In the early summer, Carlos Hinojosa, 17, realized something had changed for his mother, Frida Hinojosa, because of Facebook: He could hear her watching a news compilation in the living room about racism and the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
Hinojosa, a rising high school senior in Laurel, Maryland, said he had tried to strike up conversations about racism with her before. He said that his mother, having come from Mexico, could unknowingly invoke racial stereotypes, especially involving nonwhite Latinos.
The best way to start conversation, he found, was through Facebook, his mother’s favorite social media platform. He and his sister have sent her videos and articles about the protests.
“I have been educated by my children,” said Frida Hinojosa, 50. “They have called this to my attention.”
Her son’s activism also drew her into conversation, and even participation. After he used Instagram to plan a protest in his town in June, she helped him make signs, hand out water and give volunteers yellow vests.
Ultimately, more than 2,000 people attended, he said, and Hinojosa listened to her son’s friends tell stories about racism they had faced.
“It’s the most important step to solving any problem,” Carlos Hinojosa said.
Other teenagers have turned to one another when they have had trouble talking with family or have been unable find resources.
Over several months from her home in Baltimore, Betsy Schultz, 17, created a 37-page Google Doc about Black Lives Matter, including links to donate to GoFundMe pages, online petitions and a guide for books, documentaries and more.
Schultz has been trying to create a one-stop shop of resources for other young activists, which has quickly expanded. But she said it has been hard to explain the movement to her father, a political independent who sometimes leans conservative. They often disagree about what they see and hear in the news and on social media, she said — for instance, about who is at fault in clashes between protesters and the police.
But Schultz still urged other teenagers to voice their beliefs.
“These conversations can be difficult, and it can be extremely hard changing someone’s mind,” Schultz said. “Even if you can’t make a direct impact on your family, there are so many other ways to take action.”
Historians of civil rights movements said that social media sets these protests apart from others, giving demonstrators a platform to organize and resources to draw from.
And through videos and photos, social media has made the experience of violence against Black people more immediate to a wide audience, said Thomas Holt, a history professor at the University of Chicago.
In the 1950s and ’60s, television and photographs played a large role in growing protest movements, showing images of violence on Black Americans to a broad population of viewers. Brutal photographs showing the body of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy murdered by a white mob in 1955, became the turning point for the beginning of the civil rights movement, Holt said.
Such images convey the violence that Black people worry about daily, said Kevin Gaines, a civil rights professor at the University of Virginia.
“African-American youth don’t have the luxury of being unaware of racism and racist violence,” he said.
Today, images and videos of violence, like those of Floyd’s killing, spread with incredible speed online, sometimes reaching tens of thousands of people within hours.
Holt said that reach was reflected in the extent of support for Black Lives Matter today — possibly the largest movement in U.S. history — compared with support for the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
“This is quite something else,” he said.
Gaines also said there were downsides to the role that social media plays, including the potential to cheapen discourse; “canceling” people when they make an error rather than giving them space to grow from their mistakes; and allowing social media to be a substitute for political work that would make substantial change.
When the conversation goes awry
For many families, these conversations have never been easy. Now, Americans are increasingly polarized by politics, and the tensions of a pandemic, an economic crisis and an election year are colliding.
In Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, Jessica Piccari said she was at her wit’s end with some family members. At a birthday party, Piccari, 18, heard her grandmother’s sister use a racial slur. Shocked, she told her it was racist: “You cannot say that. That’s not OK.”
Despite her repeated protests, Piccari said some family members continue to use slurs and express their disapproval of the protests in front of her. She also worries that her best friends and boyfriend, who are Black, could end up the target of violence by the police or opponents of the protesters.
“I get stern,” she said. “Sometimes I get angry, sometimes I get upset because we shouldn’t have to be talking about this.”
Although Piccari and her mother agree on much about the movement, their conversations can grow tense over disputes about the methods and aims of some protesters.
Those disagreements often seem to start on social media, like when Piccari tagged her college in an Instagram post about defunding the police. Her mother admonished her, telling her to be careful about posts that might be seen by powerful institutions — but she also respected her boundaries.
“As uncomfortable as it is, I have no right to tell her that she’s wrong,” Kathy Piccari, 40, said. “I’m proud of her for speaking out.”
When the conversation lasts decades
As in the civil rights movement, young people have been heavily involved in recent protests, but Black people have never been shielded from the conversations about racism, Gaines said.
Occasionally, glimpses of these moments are caught on social media, as in Charlotte, North Carolina, in June, when a Black teenager and two Black men, each in a different decade of life, had an emotional exchange about how to best protest.
More often, these conversations help pass the baton. In Kalamazoo, Michigan, Key’Maura Lewis, 15, said that she and her grandparents, Marvin and Barbara Gilleylen, had been having conversations about police brutality and racism since she was in elementary school.
But Floyd’s death was the tipping point for Lewis, who is Black. It moved her to organize a protest in her area — with her grandparents’ support. (They also bought snacks.)
“Some adults, they just overpower us,” Lewis said. “They look at us like most of the time we don’t know what we’re talking about or that our voices and opinions don’t matter.”
Her grandparents, though, have included Lewis in conversations. They have told her about the oppression they faced growing up, shared lessons from those experiences and pushed her to help other Black Americans with that perspective.
“They have children and they worry about them coming home like any Black parents, and they know why I protest and what I’m fighting for,” Lewis said.

Trump’s Approval Rating, Biden’s Low Bar: This Week in the 2020 Race

Welcome to our weekly analysis of the state of the 2020 campaign.
The week in numbers
— Joe Biden’s campaign said it raised $70 million during the four-day Democratic National Convention.
— 21.8 million people tuned in on television for Biden’s big night at the convention Thursday, according to Nielsen, slightly more than the 21 million who watched former President Barack Obama and Sen. Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, Wednesday. The TV viewership for the nominee’s speech was down about 21% from Hillary Clinton’s acceptance speech four years ago, although many people watched online.
— A new Gallup poll put President Donald Trump’s approval rating at 42%. Americans’ approval of his handling of the economy — typically his strong suit — was 48%, roughly even with his numbers from June but 15 percentage points off his career high in the winter, just before the pandemic struck.
— Pollsters mostly paused their work during the convention, waiting for things to play out before taking a fresh read of the country. But at the start of the week, three separate polls by respected outlets showed Biden leading Trump by an average of 8 points.
Catch me up
Democrats breathed a collective sigh of relief this past week after the party pulled off an all-virtual convention, half political music video and half Biden infomercial, largely without a hitch.
And whether you liked the content of Biden’s acceptance speech or found yourself unmoved by his message, one thing was clear: He outperformed the low expectations set in part by his general election opponent.
The Biden of the Republican Party’s telling is a gaffe machine whose age has rendered him unable to speak clearly, a caricature built over months of tweets by Trump, scores of interviews by his allies and nightly roasts by popular conservative media figures. The Biden many Americans saw this past week was cleareyed and capable of commanding an audience, albeit reading from a teleprompter in a room that was largely empty.
If that is a low bar, it is because Trump and some of his most prominent allies have helped to lower it.
The Trump campaign and the expectations game
Outside advisers have tried to warn Trump that he needs to raise expectations for his opponents while lowering them for himself. But that hasn’t stopped the president from bragging to people that he expects the fall debates to be a bruising experience for his opponent. Trump was eager to run as an underdog four years ago, but this time his campaign has sought to project an image of dominance, in ways that are not always helpful.
— At the president’s June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Brad Parscale, the former Trump campaign manager, violated a cardinal rule of politics: Underestimate crowd sizes in order to overdeliver. Instead, he made Trump look foolish when only 6,200 people showed up for an event that Parscale claimed had 1 million ticket requests.
— Instead of talking up how Biden could be a formidable opponent on the debate stage, Trump and his advisers have mostly done the opposite. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, claimed recently that there was “an active push to get Joe Biden to not debate my father” because of concerns that he was not capable of handling the matchup.
— Jason Miller, a campaign strategist, has tried to change course on how the Trump team is framing Biden. “Joe Biden is actually a very good debater,” he told The Washington Post this month. But after all the denigration of Biden, a lone comment from one operative did little to reset the narrative.
Biden aims for the center, not the left
There was a choose-your-own-adventure element to the speakers at the Democratic convention. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made policy cases, while current and former Republicans made the case for decency. But throughout the week there was a clear emphasis on winning over ideological moderates and Trump-skeptical voters — a prioritization of persuasion over rallying the base.
Consider this:
— John Kasich, a Republican and former governor of Ohio, addressed fears that Biden would govern in the interest of the party’s left. “I’m sure there are Republicans and independents who couldn’t imagine crossing over to support a Democrat,” he said. “They fear Joe may turn sharp left and leave them behind. I don’t believe that. Because I know the measure of the man — reasonable, faithful, respectful. And you know, no one pushes Joe around.”
— Biden constructed his acceptance speech to explicitly pivot from partisanship. “While I will be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president,” he said. “I will work as hard for those who didn’t support me as I will for those who did.”
— During the convention, a key Biden adviser talked down the idea of deficit spending on new programs. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, former Sen. Ted Kaufman of Delaware, who is overseeing Biden’s transition team, said it was hard to envision big new spending programs in 2021. “When you see what Trump’s done to the deficit,” he said, citing the president’s tax cuts on top of virus relief spending, “we’re going to be limited.”
What will the Republican convention be like?
The Biden granddaughters were lovely. Shorter speeches were effective. The travelogue roll call made for strangely good TV. And answering the Republicans’ “Where’s Hunter?” battle cry with a video testimonial from the once wayward Biden son was delicately handled.
Those were concessions that Trump advisers and former White House officials handed to the Democratic National Committee after it pulled off the first-ever virtual convention, even while they took issue with the overall message of the week.
The question is, how do they top that now? It may be difficult.
— Republican officials wasted time that could have been used to plan a highly produced semi-virtual convention by trying — for much longer than the Democrats — to pull off a normal one. Trump scrapped his plans for an in-person convention in Jacksonville, Florida, just a month before the event was scheduled to take place.
— Instead of handing over the reins to an experienced television producer, Trump is trying to weigh in on much of the programming himself, mostly with the help of people from his own White House. And he’s insistent on having it still look on television like a “real convention,” i.e., with an audience component, and on playing a major role himself every night.
— The DNC’s four nights showcasing the diversity of the Democratic Party also heightens the pressure on the Republican National Committee and Trump to do more than appeal to aggrieved white voters. Republican officials are planning to highlight Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the white couple from St. Louis who brandished weapons at Black Lives Matter protesters in June. Will they have a message for people other than the president’s hard-core base?
What you might have missed
— Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are both expected to attend their convention’s in-person roll call in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Monday.
— Women collectively got more airtime than men at the Democratic convention, and people of color got about half of the speaking time, according to a New York Times analysis.
— You may have seen the children’s letter blocks spelling out BLM, or Black Lives Matter, behind Warren during her speech in a classroom. She had other Easter eggs, too.

Shouting Turns to Violence in Portland as Dueling Protests Converge

PORTLAND, Ore. — Right-wing and left-wing groups clashed in front of the U.S. courthouse in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday, weeks after federal agents pulled back from the site of protests that have gripped part of the city’s downtown for months.
A group of about 200 protesters, including members of the Proud Boys and families supporting the police, gathered along the courthouse sidewalk beginning at 11 a.m. Many of them were holding American flags, while others carried assault rifles and wore tactical military gear.
Almost immediately, a similar number of Black Lives Matter protesters gathered across the street, many dressed in all black and carrying shields or paintball guns.
Within an hour, shouting turned to violence.
Paintballs flew between the two sides. Bottles soared back and forth. Shoves became punches. As protesters who were struck with pepper spray moved back, others came forward to take their place.
All the while, police officers watched from a distance and chose not to intervene.
The Portland Police Bureau said in a news release that it did not declare a riot because it had limited personnel for the number of protesters and weapons present.
The statement said that weeks of “violent actions directed at the police” were “a major consideration for determining if police resources are necessary to interject between two groups with individuals who appear to be willingly engaging in physical confrontations for short durations.”
Several people were punched or hit with objects, although there did not appear to be serious injuries. Mike Redwood, a Black Lives Matter protester, said he was hit in the face with a baton and shocked with a stun gun during an altercation with far-right demonstrators.
“I still have all my teeth and nothing’s broken, so I guess it’s not that bad for being hit with a bat,” he said while holding an ice pack to his cheek.
For about three hours, the two sides were in almost constant conflict, much of it violent. Redwood said that he and several other Black Lives Matter protesters had occupied part of the street and that he held his ground when the opposing line advanced.
After a majority of the right-wing demonstrators left, police officers declared the crowd unlawful and dispersed it.
Redwood said it was one of the more violent confrontations he had seen between right-wing and left-wing demonstrators in Portland.
“I haven’t seen it to this degree,” he said.
Portland has been the site of some of the country’s most visible Black Lives Matter protests since George Floyd was killed in police custody in Minneapolis in late May. There have been protests of varying degrees downtown for more than 80 days.
The regular demonstrations prompted President Donald Trump to send federal agents to protect the U.S. courthouse, a move that mothers, veterans and nurses considered a provocation and protested against. Those agents, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, have since been pulled back, and rallies have continued.
Susan Schaffer, who lives in Portland and joined the pro-police rally, said she was mortified by Floyd’s death. Still, she said she thought the protests had been allowed to continue for too long and with too much leniency from local leaders.
Karen Mann, who came to join the protesters from Salem, Oregon, said she was partly inspired to attend when her house was egged after she put a Trump sign in her yard.
The protests in Portland have fostered that animosity, she said.
“Why can’t I say I support Trump? I should be able to do that without being intimidated,” she said. “They really want to destroy everyone who is center-right or center.”
Turning away from the pepper spray that hung in the air, Andrew Benjamin said he worried that Trump and other conservative politicians would say that Saturday’s protest was an example of chaos caused by the Black Lives Matter movement.
“They’ll say Portland is burning. Portland’s not burning,” Benjamin said. “This is one side of one block. It’s not even downtown; it’s right here, in front of that building.”

When Nicole Taylor’s agent suggested three years ago that she write a Juneteenth cookbook, Taylor, a food writer, shelved the idea. She didn’t think any publisher would buy it.
But early this summer, after several months spent working on a proposal, Taylor had a deal worth many times what she was paid for her last cookbook, which was published in 2019.
As pressure mounts on the publishing industry to diversify its pool of authors, there has been a flurry of activity around cookbooks written by Black people. This increase in acquisitions has been welcomed by many people of color in the field, even as they warn the industry’s problems cannot be solved just by cutting checks.
“Every Black cookbook author has a story that will make your mouth drop,” Taylor said. “Whether it’s about money or marketing or having to fight for this or that recipe, we all have a story. There’s a different standard for us, and a box we get put in.”
Many Black writers and chefs say there has long been an unspoken limit on the number of books that are produced about Black food, compared with a seemingly bottomless appetite for titles on French or Italian cuisine. Some feel typecast or stereotyped by the cooking styles expected of them — chef Adrienne Cheatham, for example, said she has lost track of the number of times she’s been asked to submit recipes for fried chicken. There have also been concerns about whether Black writers are paid as much as their white peers.
Taylor said that private conversations with other writers about compensation were helpful to her. There has also been a public conversation around who gets big advances from publishing houses and who does not, much of it surfaced through the #PublishingPaidMe hashtag on Twitter, which encouraged Black and non-Black authors to divulge what they earned.
Agents and editors say the demand for books by Black authors has jumped since Black Lives Matter protests spread across the United States and books about race and anti-racism began to dominate bestseller lists. Karen Murgolo, the editorial director of lifestyle and culinary publishing for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, said the bump in activity has not been limited to cookbooks.
At a recent acquisitions meeting she attended, three of the four projects up for consideration were by African American authors. And in some cases, agents and authors say, the rush has increased the advances publishers are paying.
“For my Black authors, the needle has shifted,” said Sharon Bowers, Taylor’s literary agent. “The market is allowing me to do more for them than I ever have before.”
Getting a book deal, however, is just the start of a long process. Cookbooks take about two years to make. There are recipes to write and test, food to stage and photograph, editing and production, all before a book is sent to the printer. At every step, the teams involved tend to be overwhelmingly white. Some Black writers say this can put them in a position of having to explain the basics of the food they’re writing about. That lack of familiarity can trickle into the recipes, too.
“We have to explain injera in a way you don’t have to explain brioche,” said Osayi Endolyn, a James Beard Award-winning food writer, “even though most Americans probably can’t tell you what brioche is.”
Author Toni Tipton-Martin said that after she won her first James Beard Award, she used that leverage to request as many Black people as possible for her creative team, in roles like food stylist, prop stylist and photographer.
“I wanted Black representation, and that was a difficult request to fulfill,” she said. “Which also speaks to the inequities in the industry, that there are so few people who fit those profiles.”
When Black writers land book deals, the challenges don’t necessarily end. In 2014, Kristina Gill, a Black food writer and photographer based in Italy, partnered with Katie Parla, a white food journalist, on a cookbook called “Tasting Rome.” The agreement was that Parla would write half the recipes and contextualize the chapters, in addition to supervising the testing of the recipes. Gill took care of the photography and developed the other half of the recipes.
But while Gill and Parla were co-authors, Gill said she was sidelined throughout the publication process and later excluded from the book’s publicity campaign. “I felt that they were making me subordinate to her, even though very clearly, plain as day, it said on our contract with the publisher that we were equal,” Gill said.
Gill said communication with their editor went through Parla, and news coverage of the book usually named Parla as the book’s sole author. A website the publisher created for the book did not list Gill until she protested, and at a launch party for “Tasting Rome,” Gill said neither she nor her role in the book were acknowledged.
“I think it was racism,” Gill said. “I don’t know any other way to describe how or why you wouldn’t want my face anywhere.”
Gill was frustrated by the experience, but the book, published by Clarkson Potter in 2016, was a success. This spring, after the police killing of George Floyd, when many companies expressed support for Black people and the Black Lives Matter movement, Clarkson Potter said on Instagram that it stood against racism and was committed to listening to its readers and authors. Gill said she felt she had to speak up.
She contacted Aaron Wehner, the publisher of Clarkson Potter, to relay her experience with the imprint. The company began an investigation into her claims. Wehner later told Gill in an email that its findings “support your account of the repeated marginalization and disrespect you experienced during the process,” but the company concluded in a later investigation that the behavior was not racist. Shortly after, the woman who edited “Tasting Rome,” along with her supervisor, left the company.
In a statement, Clarkson Potter apologized for Gill’s negative experience. “We have offered Kristina Gill, if she is willing, the opportunity to publish with us again so we may give her our full respect and support,” it said. Parla has also apologized to Gill.
Even in the rush of attention some Black authors are now receiving, not all of it feels sincere.
When J.J. Johnson, a Black chef in New York City, was shopping his second cookbook around to publishers this summer, seven publishing houses said they were interested before they knew anything about it, he said. But after one editor read the book proposal, she called it too ambitious. Another told Johnson he was reaching for the stars, in a bad way.
It felt like coded language intended to brush him off. “Using words such as ‘ambitious,’” he said, “they would never say that to my white peers.”
He signed with an editor at Flatiron Books who published his last cookbook, which won a James Beard Award.

KENOSHA, Wis. — Peaceful marches in protest of a police shooting gave way to fires, destruction and looting in Kenosha as a strip of businesses in a central residential neighborhood was consumed in flames early Tuesday.
Residents emerged from their houses overnight to gape at billowing smoke that could be seen for miles. Lost in the blaze, neighbors said, was a mattress store, a storefront church, a Mexican restaurant, and a cellphone store. Less than a mile away, a probation and parole office was also on fire.
A line of National Guard members, called to Kenosha amid rising tension over the shooting Sunday of Jacob Blake, a Black resident who was shot by a white police officer, prevented anyone from getting close as firefighters worked to douse the flames.
“This is our town,” said Mike Mehlan, 33, a chef, as he stared at the buildings, stunned.
Mehlan said that just a half-hour before, he saw at least 20 cars pull up to a nearby gas station, break in and then head to the stores one block away. They entered the mattress store and set it on fire, he said.
In several other cities around the country overnight, there were demonstrations and, in some cases, flashes of destruction in protests that cited the shooting of Blake as the nation’s latest example of police violence.
In Kenosha, the worst destruction was limited to a relatively small area of the city, which is home to about 100,000 people, and some neighborhoods of Kenosha were quiet. At least one sheriff’s deputy was injured in the neck by a firework that was set off. It was uncertain whether there were arrests.
One resident said he had little problem with burning businesses to spur social change and reform to policing.
“It’s unfortunate, but it has to be done,” said Wayne Gardner, who lives around the corner.
Police offered little detail about what had happened in the shooting, saying only that an officer had shot Blake while responding to a domestic incident. Local and state officials have declined to provide information about the officers who responded.
Blake, 29, was in stable condition at a hospital. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, said he had been told that Blake was attempting to intervene in an argument between two women when police arrived.
In a video taken from an apartment window across the street, several officers can be seen standing on a sidewalk next to a four-door SUV. The man identified as Blake, wearing a white tank top and black shorts, is seen walking along the passenger side of the vehicle, away from the officers, who are yelling. At least one of them points a gun at him.
Blake walks around the front of the vehicle and opens the driver’s side door. Several people can be heard yelling, and one officer is seen grabbing Blake’s shirt. As Blake opens the vehicle door, at least half a dozen shots are heard, while at least two officers can be seen with their guns pointed at him. The video, which is about 20 seconds long, ends shortly after the shooting.
The video spread quickly on social media, and demonstrators beyond Kenosha spoke of Blake in marches overnight. In Madison, Wisconsin, about 4,000 people gathered near the state Capitol and marched downtown, some smashing glass storefronts and setting dumpsters ablaze. A liquor store was looted.
In Portland, Oregon, where nightly protests have continued for nearly three months, a few hundred demonstrators began a march by chanting about Blake. The crowd later gathered outside a building for the Portland Police Association, and some demonstrators lit fires on the exterior of the building before police moved in, using tear gas, shoving protesters to the ground and making arrests.
In Seattle, some 200 people marched in solidarity with Kenosha. The group was led by a line of protesters holding shields, and occasionally a small group of musicians. Some protesters threw trash and then fireworks at the East Precinct police station, igniting a fire in front of the building. Some also broke windows at a Starbucks.
In New York, hundreds of people marched peacefully down Fifth Avenue in support of Blake. There were no arrests, according to police.
In Minneapolis, at least 11 people were arrested downtown, outside the Hennepin County Adult Detention Center, after authorities said protesters grew destructive during protests. Sheriff Dave Hutchinson of Hennepin County said protesters broke windows at a detention center and “threatened to breach the security of the jail.” One police officer suffered a broken hand during a confrontation with demonstrators, he said.
“We fully support peaceful protests, but we cannot — and will not — allow demonstrators to destroy property or jeopardize the safety and security of our inmates, our deputies and our jail,” the sheriff said.
In Kenosha, Chauncey Body, 44, watched the flames from the sidewalk.
“This hurts,” he said.
He said that if the fires were set in the name of protest, he believed in the conviction behind them.
“But this is a neighborhood. They’re putting lives in danger,” he said.
Kenosha, which has been engulfed in protests, unrest and destruction for two days, is under a curfew at night. Police officers attempted to disperse people who were standing outside, with little success. They used tear gas to try to clear people away.
Sheriff David Beth of Kenosha County said police were outnumbered.
“We’ve got 200 officers, I don’t know how many armored vehicles,” he said. “It’s not enough. It’s a battle we aren’t able to keep up with.”

Black Homeowners Face Discrimination in Appraisals

Abena and Alex Horton wanted to take advantage of low home-refinance rates brought on by the coronavirus crisis. So in June, they took the first step in that process, welcoming a home appraiser into their four-bedroom, four-bath ranch-style house in Jacksonville, Florida.
The Hortons live just minutes from the Ortega River, in a predominantly white neighborhood of 1950s homes that tend to sell for $350,000 to $550,000. They had expected their home to appraise for around $450,000, but the appraiser felt differently, assigning a value of $330,000. Abena Horton, who is Black, immediately suspected discrimination.
The couple’s bank agreed that the value was off and ordered a second appraisal. But before the new appraiser could arrive, Horton, a lawyer, began an experiment: She took all family photos off the mantle. Instead, she hung up a series of oil paintings of Alex Horton, who is white, and his grandparents that had been in storage. Books by Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison were taken off the shelves, and holiday photo cards sent by friends were edited so that only those showing white families were left on display. On the day of the appraisal, Abena Horton took the couple’s 6-year-old son on a shopping trip to Target, and left Alex Horton alone at home to answer the door.
The new appraiser gave their home a value of $465,000 — a more than 40% increase from the first appraisal.
Race and housing policy have long been intertwined in the United States. Black Americans consistently struggle more than their white counterparts to be approved for home loans, and the specter of redlining — a practice that denied mortgages to people of color in certain neighborhoods — continues to drive down home values in Black neighborhoods.
Even in mixed-race and predominantly white neighborhoods, Black homeowners say, their homes are consistently appraised for less than those of their neighbors, stymying their path toward building equity and further perpetuating income equality in the United States.
Home appraisers are bound by the Fair Housing Act of 1968 to not discriminate based on race, religion, national origin or gender. Appraisers can lose their license or even face prison time if they are found to produce discriminatory appraisals. Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, enacted in 1989, also binds appraisers to a standard of unbiased ethics and performance.
“My heart kind of broke,” Abena Horton said. “I know what the issue was. And I knew what we needed to do to fix it, because in the Black community, it’s just common knowledge that you take your pictures down when you’re selling the house. But I didn’t think I had to worry about that with an appraisal.”
Appraisals, by nature, are subjective. And discrimination, particularly the subconscious biases and microaggressions that have risen to the fore in white America this summer following the death of George Floyd, is notoriously difficult to pinpoint.
Horton shared her experiment in a widely circulated Facebook post, earning 25,000 shares and more than 2,000 comments, many of which came from Black homeowners and carried the same message: This also happened to me.
In each comment, a repeated theme: Home appraisers, who work under codes of ethics but with little regulation and oversight, are often all that stands between the accumulation of home equity and the destruction of it for Black Americans.
After the first appraisal came up short on his house in an affluent, racially mixed suburb of Hartford, Connecticut, Stephen Richmond, an aerospace engineer, took down family photos and posters for Black movies and had a white neighbor stand in for him on a second appraisal. He was hoping to refinance; with the second report, he saw his home’s value go up $40,000 from the initial appraisal just a few weeks earlier.
In 2000, actor and comedian D.L. Hughley had an appraisal on his home in the Montevista Estates neighborhood of West Hills, a primarily white area in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. Despite a steady uptick in the housing market and the addition of a pool and new hardwood floors, the house was appraised for nearly what he had bought it for three years earlier — $500,000.
In Hughley’s case, his bank flagged the report.
“They were like, this has to be some kind of mistake because in order for your house to have come in this low, it would have to be in some level of disrepair,” Hughley said.
The bank ordered a new appraisal, which came back $160,000 higher, and Hughley went on to sell the home for $770,000.
Hughley talks about the experience in his book, “Surrender, White People!”, a satirical look at white supremacy, which was published in June by Harper Collins and examines racial inequality in the United States across education, health care and the housing market.
“People always tell us to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps. But what if you remove the straps?” he said. “You’re invested in the American dream, you have capital, you have a chip in the game. And the fact that somebody could summarily minimize my wealth just because of a bias, it seemed crazy to me.”
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, a federal ruling issued in March allowed appraisals for homes that were being sold to be done remotely in certain circumstances, temporarily pausing the need for interior home inspections. Those looking to refinance, however, still must complete an in-person appraisal.
In Hughley’s case, the appraiser was fired. Horton has filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. When contacted about her case, HUD said it had been assigned to the Jacksonville Human Rights Commission. The agency added that it receives a handful of similar complaints each year.
In 2018, researchers from Gallup and the Brookings Institution published a report on the widespread devaluation of Black-owned property in the United States, which they discussed in a 2019 hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee. The report found that a home in a majority Black neighborhood is likely to be valued for 23% less than a near-identical home in a majority-white neighborhood; it also determined this devaluation costs Black homeowners $156 billion in cumulative losses.
Many appraisers, both during the hearing and in the weeks after, defended their practice, noting that it is their job to report on local market conditions, not set them.
“Is there a problem with poor and underserved communities in the United States? Yes. Is it the appraisal profession’s fault? No,” wrote Maureen Sweeney, a Chicago-based appraiser in a letter to the House subcommittee following the hearing. “It’s like blaming the canary for the bad air in the coal mine, or blaming the mirror for your bad hair day. Appraisers reflect the market; we do not create it.”
But what about a Black homeowner in a white neighborhood whose property is appraised for less than his neighbor’s? Whether appraisers are devaluing Black homes or entire Black neighborhoods, the core issue is the same, said Andre Perry, one of the writers of the Brookings Institution report and the author of “Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities.”
“We still see Black people as risky,” Perry said. “White appraisers carry the same attitudes and beliefs of white America — the same attitudes that compelled Derek Chauvin to kneel casually on the neck of George Floyd are shared by other professionals in other fields. How does that choking out of America look in the appraisal industry? Through very low appraisals,” he said.

Do New York City Voters Want Another White Mayor?

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Six months ago, the 2021 race for mayor in New York City seemed to be coalescing around three well-known Democrats, all male elected officials, and two of them white.
The white men, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, had name recognition, fundraising advantages and institutional support, making it hard to fathom any other candidate’s having a serious chance to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will step down because of term-limit requirements.
But then New York City confronted first by a pandemic that has killed nearly 24,000 people in the city, many of them Black and Latino, and then waves of civil unrest stirred by Black Lives Matter protests.
With 10 months before the 2021 mayoral primary, the race may still come down to Stringer, Johnson or the third well-known Democrat, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who is Black.
But the results of the recent Democratic primary offer evidence that some New Yorkers may be seeking an alternative: a fresh face, perhaps someone more progressive, and not a white candidate who is part of the city’s political establishment.
Three Democratic candidates of color won congressional primaries in New York, following in the footsteps of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who upset Joe Crowley, then the No. 4 House Democrat, in the 2018 primaries.
Two of the three victors are poised to become the first openly gay Black or Latino men in Congress; the third, Jamaal Bowman, a Black middle-school principal, unseated Rep. Eliot Engel, a 16-term incumbent.
The altered political calculus extended down the ballot, with Democratic women unseating incumbents in state legislative races. Many of those winning candidates were backed by organizations like the Working Families Party and the Democratic Socialists of America.
“Politics centered around the value of Black lives and a recognition of the role of Black leadership is now the center of the conversation of how we move forward as a city,” said Sochie Nnaemeka, the director of the New York State Working Families Party.
The movement has not gone unnoticed by people like Johnson, who said he has tried to find opportunities to allow Council members of color to take the lead on certain issues.
“There’s always going to be a real concern and a legitimate concern over whether a white elected official with white privilege can ever fully understand the experience of people of color in the city,” Johnson said in an interview earlier this month.
Johnson had pledged to cut $1 billion from the Police Department in response to calls to defund the police after George Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis. But the $1 billion turned out to be largely cosmetic, shifting responsibilities from the Police Department to other agencies, and partially relying on what budget watchdogs called an “unrealistic one-time reduction in overtime expenses.”
In an explanation during a virtual budget hearing at the end of June, Johnson, who appeared drained, said that he wanted to cut more. But he said he chose to support Black and Latino council members who thought $1 billion in cuts would jeopardize public safety in low-income and middle-class neighborhoods struggling with a spike in shootings and homicides.
“It would be perfectly appropriate if a voter or a voter writ large decided they wanted a person of color to be the next mayor,” he said in the interview. But on issues of racial justice and equality, Johnson said that he has “been there as a friend and an ally.”
Yet the Black Lives Matter protests, as well as a memorial service held in Brooklyn for Floyd, hinted at how Johnson and Stringer may be poorly positioned to capitalize on the moment.
At the memorial, Stringer was politely received by the audience, until he mistakenly referred to Floyd as “Greg Floyd.” Groans and jeers followed.
And when Johnson used Twitter to criticize the Police Department’s attempt to arrest a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement, his tweet had 10 times fewer retweets and likes than a similar post by Maya Wiley, a Black Democrat who is considering a bid for mayor.
Wiley, a civil rights lawyer who worked as a commentator for MSNBC and as a legal counsel for de Blasio, has harshly criticized the mayor’s response to the George Floyd protests and, with 340,000 followers on Twitter, has more social media reach than all of the major declared mayoral candidates combined.
“We need leadership that is bold in imagination but collective in spirit,” Wiley said. “That’s what my neighbors of all races are looking for as they assess the qualities they want in a champion for this city.”
It remains unclear if Wiley will be able to assemble a multiracial and progressive coalition, as de Blasio did in 2013. The mayor relied on his African-American wife and biracial children to suggest that he understood the experiences of Black people and Latinos.
That formulation helped de Blasio receive 18,000 more votes than a Black man, the former comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., in predominantly African-American communities.
Candidates who have a strong base in the Black community will start out with a tremendous advantage in a Democratic primary for mayor if they are able to create enough of a coalition with Latinos and college-educated whites, said Peter Ragone, a former top aide to de Blasio and now an informal adviser.
“There won’t be another mayor elected who does not have strong support in the African-American community and maintains that support throughout their tenure,” Ragone said.
Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, is a former police officer whose candidacy could draw from a broad swath of people across the city. He is more moderate than Wiley, but has a strong base among Black voters in Brooklyn.
Adams said in a statement that the pandemic “laid bare injustices faced by people of color that were created by failures of past city governments.”
“Those injustices were not news to people of color in the city,” he added. “My goal is to make sure that the city provides more for a young person of color tomorrow than it did for me years ago.”
Wiley has the potential to build a coalition uniting women, white progressives and Black and Latino voters, especially Black women, said Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University.
Her challenge is to “introduce herself to Black voters who are not in the WNYC and MSNBC crowd,” said Greer, who is Black. “She has been clear in her thinking about this political moment, and that translates into a managerial style that seems attractive, and that’s why she’s getting this level of interest.”
There is also speculation that another Black man, Raymond J. McGuire, the global head of corporate and investment banking at Citi, will enter the race as a moderate Democrat and sell himself as the best person to guide the city’s economic recovery.
The white male candidates in the Democratic primary have picked up on the shifting political environment.
Shaun Donovan, a former federal housing secretary and budget director under President Barack Obama, said it was time “to re-imagine policing and all these systems that perpetuate systemic racism,” and that his experience working under the first Black president gave him the tools to do so.
Stringer, who briefly ran for mayor in 2013 before dropping out to run for comptroller, began aligning himself with the progressive shift he saw taking place in the city four years ago.
“We have had three mayors over 28 years who have failed to take on racial inequality,” Stringer said. “Mayor de Blasio made a lot of promises but he hasn’t delivered.”
He was one of the first citywide elected officials in 2018 to endorse progressive challengers seeking to unseat members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a caucus that helped Senate Republicans control the chamber and block progressive legislation.
“You can say he’s a white guy, he has a lot of privilege,” said Yuh-Line Niou, an assemblywoman in Manhattan who was backed by Stringer, and said she planned to endorse his mayoral bid.
But she said she has seen Stringer repeatedly “go to the uncomfortable places and have those uncomfortable conversations.”
“There’s been a lot of people of color that have disappointed me in their stances and position on issues in our communities,” she said. “I’m not going to vote against my own interests because of the color of someone’s skin.”

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Democrats made one thing clear with the virtual pageantry of their convention last week: They are united to defeat President Donald Trump in November. The festivities also foreshadowed another looming fight, this one between the moderate and progressive wings of the party.
The convention sketched out a policy agenda for Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, in broad strokes, showcasing his big-picture priorities without citing many dollar figures. That helped Democrats appeal to as wide a universe of voters as possible. It also allowed them to skirt the policy disagreements that still exist between moderates like Biden and the progressive wing of the party, which has claimed a number of notable victories in congressional primaries this year.
“It’s not that we’ve changed our opinions on what is necessary,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said after the convention. Citing the crisis facing the country, she predicted that Biden “is going to be pushed by the times to be bold.”
“We have to do some immediate things, and the task will be to make them as progressive as possible, with the platform being sort of the floor and not the ceiling,” Jayapal said.
Here’s a guide to the policy vision that was outlined at the convention — and the disagreements that may flare up in the future.
Health care
Democrats used the convention to further a message that propelled their candidates to success in the 2018 midterm elections: The party wants to expand health coverage while Trump and the Republicans want to take it away. Biden, the former vice president, is a capable messenger on the issue, having been at President Barack Obama’s side when the president signed into law the Affordable Care Act.
But in the Democratic primary, no major issue showed a starker division within the party than the future of America’s health care system. Biden made the case for expanding on the Affordable Care Act and offering a government-run insurance plan known as a public option. Other Democrats, particularly Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, advocated “Medicare for All,” a government-run health insurance system under which private coverage would be eliminated.
That debate continues to this day. Sanders acknowledged it in his convention speech, saying, “Joe and I disagree on the best path to get universal coverage.” Instead of dwelling on that point, he made note of Biden’s plans to expand coverage, reduce the cost of prescription drugs and lower the age of Medicare eligibility to 60, from 65.
Ady Barkan, a progressive activist who was diagnosed with the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS, also spoke at the convention in support of Biden — and kept up the pressure to make big changes to the country’s health care system. Barkan supports Medicare for All and has focused on health care advocacy after his diagnosis. “With a compassionate and intelligent president,” he said, “we must act together and put on his desk a bill that guarantees us all the health care we deserve.”
There may be more disagreements to come. If Biden wins and Democrats control both houses of Congress, and if he moves ahead with trying to enact a public option, there are many variables in how exactly it could be structured.
Climate change
As wildfires tore across California and two hurricanes converged in the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since record-keeping began, Democrats made climate change a central theme of the convention and Biden named it among the “four historic crises” facing America.
His plan calls for spending $2 trillion over four years to escalate the use of clean energy. It sets a goal of eliminating planet-warming emissions from the power sector by 2035, as well as upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes over four years to increase energy efficiency. In a parallel policy plank that Biden issued around environmental justice, he set a goal of ensuring that disadvantaged communities receive 40% of the benefits of spending on clean energy and other areas.
“It’s not only a crisis, it’s an enormous opportunity,” Biden said in his speech accepting the nomination on Thursday night. “An opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process.”
It is a stance that has gotten more aggressive since the start of the Democratic primary race when his rivals, along with young activists, accused him of being insufficiently committed to dealing with climate change. Activists on the left credited themselves and the pressure they had put on Biden for making the issue a core element of his first speech as the Democratic nominee.
But his policy still leaves some progressives unhappy, particularly when it comes to the shale drilling technique known as fracking. Many of his rivals in the primary — including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, whom he selected this month to be his running mate — have called for a national ban on fracking.
Biden has said he supports a moratorium on new leases on federal lands but not a full ban. He also has pushed back aggressively on Trump campaign statements that seek to tie him to calls for a ban. It is a particularly sensitive issue in swing states like shale-rich Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point.
It was notable then that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, one of the country’s largest oil and gas producing states, was chosen to open the climate change section of the convention. Like Biden, Lujan Grisham has walked a fine line on natural gas — enacting stricter regulations on the industry while still remaining supportive of it.
Lujan Grisham did not mention fracking. Instead, she stuck to Biden’s theme, which links cutting emissions to creating clean energy jobs.
The coronavirus and the economy
Central to Biden’s campaign pitch is the promise that he can respond to the coronavirus crisis in a competent manner — and steer the economy back on track.
In his acceptance speech, Biden ticked off his plan for confronting the virus head-on, including expanding testing, giving a megaphone to public health experts and mandating that people wear masks.
Precisely how Biden, if elected, would address the virus’s economic toll is hard to game out, because it will depend on the conditions in the country next winter.
One open question, for instance, is the size of an economic package Biden might seek next winter, and what steps the federal government should take to provide financial assistance to Americans. Before she was picked as Biden’s running mate, for example, Harris teamed up with two colleagues, Sanders and Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, to propose giving $2,000 monthly cash payments to Americans throughout the crisis.
Biden has signaled that he is open to big policy solutions to revive the economy. But they might not be big enough for some progressives.
Last week offered a potential preview. Ted Kaufman, a former senator and longtime Biden adviser who is leading his transition team, suggested in a live interview with The Wall Street Journal that Biden would not significantly increase federal spending.
“The pantry’s going to be bare,” Kaufman said. “When you see what Trump’s done to the deficit in terms of just — forget about COVID-19. All the deficits that he built with the incredible tax cuts. So we’re going to be limited.”
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading progressive who symbolically nominated Sanders at the convention, called that assessment “extremely concerning.”
“The pantry is absolutely not bare,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. “We need massive investment in our country or it will fall apart. This is not a joke. To adopt GOP deficit-hawking now, when millions of lives are at stake, is utterly irresponsible.”
Over the course of the week, Democrats mentioned a variety of economic proposals, including raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, investing in infrastructure and expanding access to affordable child care. And in his convention speech, Biden said that “we don’t need a tax code that rewards wealth more than it rewards work.”
“I’m not looking to punish anyone, far from it,” Biden said. “But it’s long past time the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations in this country paid their fair share.”
In the primary campaign, Biden’s plans to raise taxes were smaller than those of his top rivals. For example, he has not called for creating a so-called wealth tax — an annual tax on the fortunes of the superrich that was a central plank of Warren’s presidential campaign and was also promoted by Sanders.
There are other areas, too, where Biden’s economic plans are more limited than what some in his party would like to see. While he moved leftward on the issues of free college tuition and student loan forgiveness this year, his proposals on those topics are narrower than what some on the left have called for. And Biden has no detailed plan on Wall Street regulation.
Racial justice and immigration
The convention also put a significant focus on racial justice, an issue that Biden has emphasized following the killing of George Floyd while in police custody.
During the convention’s opening night, Biden was shown saying, “Most cops are good, but the fact is, the bad ones have to be identified and prosecuted and out, period.” That comment was troubling to some activists at a time when progressives are seeking transformational changes in the nation’s criminal justice system.
Biden has long-standing ties to police unions, and he has not gone as far as some on the left in his comments on how policing in America should be changed. He has rejected the “defund the police” movement, though he has expressed openness to reallocating some funds, and he has proposed increasing funding for community policing.
Like others in his party, he supports tighter gun control measures, but he has not called for a national licensing program and mandatory gun buybacks, as some of his primary rivals have. He has not endorsed legalizing marijuana, a move that is widely supported by Democratic voters.
In addition, he has not expressed support for decriminalizing illegal border crossings or abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And it remains to be seen how Biden’s administration would approach issues like border security, deportations and funding for the Department of Homeland Security, especially given the criticism Biden has faced over the number of deportations that occurred during the Obama administration.
Biden has called for a 100-day moratorium on deportations, but what happens after that is unclear.
In his convention speech, at least, Biden did not shy away from embracing big plans. For a historical parallel, he reached back to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.
“Stricken by disease, stricken by a virus, FDR insisted that he would recover and prevail, and he believed America could as well,” Biden said. “And he did, and we can as well.”

Does New York Want Another White Mayor?: [National Desk]

Full text: The Black Lives Matter protests and a pandemic may have shifted the political dynamic in favor of progressive candidates of color.
Six months ago, the 2021 race for mayor in New York City seemed to be coalescing around three well-known Democrats, all male elected officials, and two of them white.
The white men, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, had name recognition, fund-raising advantages and institutional support, making it hard to fathom any other candidate's having a serious chance to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will step down because of term-limit requirements.
But then New York City was confronted first by a pandemic that has killed nearly 24,000 people in the city, many of them Black and Latino, and then waves of civil unrest stirred by Black Lives Matter protests.
With 10 months before the 2021 mayoral primary, the race may still come down to Mr. Stringer, Mr. Johnson or the third well-known Democrat, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who is Black.
But the results of the recent Democratic primary offer evidence that some New Yorkers may be seeking an alternative: a fresh face, perhaps someone more progressive, and not a white candidate who is part of the city's political establishment.
Three Democratic candidates of color won congressional primaries in New York, following in the footsteps of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who upset Joe Crowley, then the No. 4 House Democrat, in the 2018 primaries.
Two of the three victors are poised to become the first openly gay Black or Latino men in Congress; the third, Jamaal Bowman, a Black middle-school principal, unseated Representative Eliot L. Engel, a 16-term incumbent.
The altered political calculus extended down the ballot, with Democratic women unseating incumbents in state legislative races. Many of those winning candidates were backed by organizations like the Working Families Party and the Democratic Socialists of America.
"Politics centered around the value of Black lives and a recognition of the role of Black leadership is now the center of the conversation of how we move forward as a city," said Sochie Nnaemeka, the director of the New York State Working Families Party.
The movement has not gone unnoticed by people like Mr. Johnson, who said he has tried to find opportunities to allow Council members of color to take the lead on certain issues.
"There's always going to be a real concern and a legitimate concern over whether a white elected official with white privilege can ever fully understand the experience of people of color in the city," Mr. Johnson said in an interview earlier this month.
Mr. Johnson had pledged to cut $ 1 billion from the Police Department in response to calls to defund the police after George Floyd was killed by the police in Minneapolis. But the $ 1 billion turned out to be largely cosmetic, shifting responsibilities from the Police Department to other agencies, and partially relying on what budget watchdogs called an "unrealistic one-time reduction in overtime expenses."
In an explanation during a virtual budget hearing at the end of June, Mr. Johnson, who appeared drained, said that he wanted to cut more. But he said he chose to support Black and Latino council members who thought $ 1 billion in cuts would jeopardize public safety in low-income and middle-class neighborhoods struggling with a spike in shootings and homicides.
"It would be perfectly appropriate if a voter or a voter writ large decided they wanted a person of color to be the next mayor," he said in the interview. But on issues of racial justice and equality, Mr. Johnson said that he has "been there as a friend and an ally."
Yet the Black Lives Matter protests, as well as a memorial service held in Brooklyn for Mr. Floyd, hinted at how Mr. Johnson and Mr. Stringer may be poorly positioned to capitalize on the moment.
At the memorial, Mr. Stringer was politely received by the audience, until he mistakenly referred to Mr. Floyd as "Greg Floyd." Groans and jeers followed.
And when Mr. Johnson used Twitter to criticize the Police Department's attempt to arrest a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement, his tweet had 10 times fewer retweets and likes than a similar post by Maya Wiley, a Black Democrat who is considering a bid for mayor.
Ms. Wiley, a civil rights lawyer who worked as a commentator for MSNBC and as a legal counsel for Mr. de Blasio, has harshly criticized the mayor's response to the George Floyd protests and, with 340,000 followers on Twitter, has more social media reach than all of the major declared mayoral candidates combined.
"We need leadership that is bold in imagination but collective in spirit," Ms. Wiley said. "That's what my neighbors of all races are looking for as they assess the qualities they want in a champion for this city."
It remains unclear if Ms. Wiley will be able to assemble a multiracial and progressive coalition, as Mr. de Blasio did in 2013. The mayor relied on his African-American wife and biracial children to suggest that he understood the experiences of Black people and Latinos.
That formulation helped Mr. de Blasio receive 18,000 more votes than a Black man, the former comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., in predominantly African-American communities.
Candidates who have a strong base in the Black community will start out with a tremendous advantage in a Democratic primary for mayor if they are able to create enough of a coalition with Latinos and college-educated white people, said Peter Ragone, a former top aide to Mr. de Blasio and now an informal adviser.
"There won't be another mayor elected who does not have strong support in the African-American community and maintains that support throughout their tenure," Mr. Ragone said.
Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, is a former police officer whose candidacy could draw from a broad swath of people across the city. He is more moderate than Ms. Wiley, but has a strong base among Black voters in Brooklyn.
Mr. Adams said in a statement that the pandemic "laid bare injustices faced by people of color that were created by failures of past city governments."
"Those injustices were not news to people of color in the city," he added. "My goal is to make sure that the city provides more for a young person of color tomorrow than it did for me years ago."
Ms. Wiley has the potential to build a coalition uniting women, white progressives and Black and Latino voters, especially Black women, said Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University.
Her challenge is to "introduce herself to Black voters who are not in the WNYC and MSNBC crowd," said Professor Greer, who is Black. "She has been clear in her thinking about this political moment, and that translates into a managerial style that seems attractive, and that's why she's getting this level of interest."
There is also speculation that another Black man, Raymond J. McGuire, the global head of corporate and investment banking at Citi, will enter the race as a moderate Democrat and sell himself as the best person to guide the city's economic recovery.
The white male candidates in the Democratic primary have picked up on the shifting political environment.
Shaun Donovan, a former federal housing secretary and budget director under President Barack Obama, said it was time "to reimagine policing and all these systems that perpetuate systemic racism," and that his experience working under the first Black president gave him the tools to do so.
Mr. Stringer, who briefly ran for mayor in 2013 before dropping out to run for comptroller, began aligning himself with the progressive shift he saw taking place in the city four years ago.
"We have had three mayors over 28 years who have failed to take on racial inequality," Mr. Stringer said. "Mayor de Blasio made a lot of promises but he hasn't delivered."
He was one of the first citywide elected officials in 2018 to endorse progressive challengers seeking to unseat members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a caucus that helped Senate Republicans control the chamber and block progressive legislation.
"You can say he's a white guy, he has a lot of privilege," said Yuh-Line Niou, an assemblywoman in Manhattan who was backed by Mr. Stringer, and said she planned to endorse his mayoral bid.
But she said she has seen Mr. Stringer repeatedly "go to the uncomfortable places and have those uncomfortable conversations."
"There's been a lot of people of color that have disappointed me in their stances and position on issues in our communities," she said. "I'm not going to vote against my own interests because of the color of someone's skin."

KENOSHA, Wis. — Three people were shot early Wednesday, two fatally, law enforcement officials said, during a chaotic night of demonstrations over the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black resident whose children were nearby as their father was shot this week by a white police officer.
In Kenosha, a third night of protests over the shooting of Blake stretched into the early morning hours of Wednesday, after demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officials near the county courthouse downtown.
Tuesday evening was spent in a shifting, hourslong standoff between the police and protesters. Protesters assembled outside a newly erected metal barrier protecting the courthouse and threw water bottles, rocks and fireworks at police.
The police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, repeatedly warning the crowd through a bullhorn that they were violating the city curfew of 8 p.m. and risking arrest. The crowd was eventually forced out of the park with tear gas and onto city streets, where the standoff continued.
Many protesters left the area, but others lingered and walked to a gas station several blocks away. There, a group of men with guns stood outside, promising to protect the property and verbally sparring with the arriving protesters. As the night stretched on, the gas station became a tense gathering spot, with bystanders watching from parked cars and people milling around in the street, arguing and occasionally shoving each other.
Police officers had crept closer to the gas station in armored trucks, urging the people who were still there to go home.
After midnight, shots were fired outside the gas station. Three people were struck, Sheriff David Beth said in an interview. The Kenosha Police Department said in a statement that there were two fatalities, and that one person had been taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.
Beth said that the investigation was focused on the group of men with guns outside the gas station, and that investigators were scouring video taken just before the shooting.
In one video, the men are shouting at each other, clutching their guns and occasionally pulling each other away to defuse the conflict.
“I’ve had people saying, ‘Why don’t you deputize citizens?’” he said. “This is why you don’t deputize citizens with guns to protect Kenosha.”
On Tuesday, Blake’s mother, Julia Jackson, had told reporters that she opposed the sort of destruction that had been left by protests spurred by her son’s shooting. On earlier nights, buildings and trucks had been burned down in Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people, where more than 100 members of the Wisconsin National Guard have been deployed amid the unrest.
Jackson told reporters that she had been praying for the country to heal.
“I’ve noticed a lot of damage,” she said. “It doesn’t reflect my son or my family.”
Blake, she and other family members said, is conscious in a hospital after being shot seven times. Family members and lawyers said that he was partially paralyzed from a bullet that severed his spinal cord and unaware of the protests that have spread across the country in his name.
Blake’s parents and siblings denounced the police and pleaded for justice.
It was a “senseless attempted murder,” Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr., said as he broke down and wept. “They shot my son seven times, like he didn’t matter.”
He said he had no confidence that the shooting of a Black man by a white officer would be fairly investigated.
That investigation is in the hands of the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation, which has not released basic information about the shooting, including the name of the officer, who has been placed on administrative leave.
The Kenosha Police Department, which has also declined to provide details of what happened, has been at the center of criticism from demonstrators, who protested for a third night on Tuesday.

HONG KONG — The images shocked Hong Kong and put the city’s authorities under a global spotlight. In shaky smartphone videos, a group of unidentified men wearing white T-shirts and wielding sticks and clubs set upon an unarmed group of residents at a subway station, some of them returning from a pro-democracy protest. The police were nowhere in sight.
On Wednesday, more than a year later, Hong Kong’s police moved decisively to address the assault — in part, by arresting a lawmaker who recorded it.
Lam Cheuk-ting, a former anti-corruption investigator, was one of two lawmakers arrested in a continuing crackdown on dissent as the Chinese Communist Party tightens its grip on the territory. As part of that effort, Hong Kong authorities are increasingly trying to change the narrative, portraying the clampdown as a necessary law-and-order remedy for a city they say is increasingly ungovernable.
Hong Kong police have faced widespread criticism after protesters accused them of ignoring calls for help on July 21, 2019, at the Yuen Long subway station, where at least 45 people were injured when men carrying sticks and metal bars attacked commuters and protesters.
At a news conference Wednesday after the arrests, Chan Tin-chu, a senior police official, described the Yuen Long incident as a “clash” and said that news reports, including footage livestreamed by a reporter as well as Lam, had wrongly given the impression that it was a one-sided assault. The footage was widely seen and used by The New York Times in a video analysis of the attack.
“Unfortunately, the camera only captured the actions of one side most of the time, and some commentary has led people to misinterpret that this is a so-called indiscriminate attack,” he said.
Beijing’s efforts to tighten its grip on Hong Kong, a semiautonomous former British colony handed back to China more than 20 years ago, set off huge and sometimes violent protests last year. Frustrated by the inability of local officials to stop the unrest, Chinese officials in June imposed a broad national security law that empowers Hong Kong authorities to take a stronger hand in quelling dissent and punishing those who espouse ideas loathed by Beijing, such as Hong Kong independence from the mainland.
Lam, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council who has said he showed up at Yuen Long to protect local residents, was among a number of people arrested on Wednesday who were accused of taking part in the attack. He was also arrested along with another lawmaker, Ted Hui, because of their presence at an anti-government protest in the Tuen Mun district on July 6, 2019, the Democratic Party of Hong Kong said in a Facebook post.
The police on Wednesday sought to counter accusations by protesters that they had been too slow to respond to the Yuen Long attack. While police had initially said that officers arrived on the scene 39 minutes after receiving reports, Chan said Wednesday that they had actually responded within 18 minutes. The previous time was quoted before officers had a chance to comprehensively analyze surveillance footage, he said.
Protesters also accused the police of being friendly with the men in white T-shirts, which Chan disputed. He said that an officer shown on video placing his hand on the shoulder of one of the men in white was actually giving him a commanding push, not a friendly pat, as the gesture was widely perceived at the time.
“We have to restore the truth,” Chan said, adding that accusations of police inaction and collusion were slanderous and made to further political agendas. He said that the force was firmly against any act of violence and that those who committed crimes would have to bear the consequences.
“As long as there is evidence proving you have broken the law, the police will enforce the law diligently and impartially,” he said.
Before Wednesday, police had already arrested 44 people believed to be part of the white T-shirt gang, and prosecutors had charged eight of them with rioting.
Thirteen of the 16 people detained on Wednesday are also accused of taking part in the Yuen Long attack, police said. They said the group included a bank vice president, a chef, a driver, a technical worker and others. Some of those arrested have ties to organized crime groups known as triads, Chan said.
The three others, as well as Lam, were arrested in connection with an encounter in July 2019 outside the Tuen Mun police station, when a group of people surrounded a man who was taking photos of protesters, snatched the phone away and deleted the images, according to a police statement. Police said they were detained on suspicion of “unlawful assembly,” “criminal damage,” “obstruction of justice” and “accessing electronic devices with dishonest intent.”
A Democratic Party representative said Lam and Hui had been serving as mediators when the Tuen Mun protests, which began peacefully, took a violent turn.
Hong Kong’s crackdown on dissent has been broad and sweeping. More than a dozen leading pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers were arrested in April in connection with the protests that raged in the city last year.
The police also arrested and released the prominent pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai this month and raided the offices of his newspaper, Apple Daily, in a stark demonstration of what activists called China’s resolve to silence the opposition and bring the city to heel.
The authorities are also employing a digital dragnet to target opposition politicians, activists and media figures.
The Hong Kong government has barred 12 candidates, including moderate pro-democracy figures, from a legislative election that had been scheduled for September but was postponed until next year.
City officials said the delay was necessary because of the coronavirus pandemic, but opposition lawmakers said it was intended to avoid a resounding defeat of pro-Beijing candidates. The pro-democracy camp announced last Thursday that it would conduct a poll to decide whether to stage a boycott or continue serving for the extended term.
Protests have been muted since the national security law came into effect, but some, like Lam, continue to speak out against the city’s new limits.
In video footage of what looked like police officers at his door on Wednesday morning, Lam asked why he was being arrested in connection to the Yuen Long attack.
“The crime of rioting,” an officer said in a video shared by a Democratic Party staff member.
“Me, taking part in a riot? The July 21 riot?” Lam said in apparent disbelief. “It’s now utter absurdity in Hong Kong.”
A representative of the Democratic Party also shared a letter the police commissioner sent to Lam this month commending him for his response to the attacks.
“You’ve fulfilled your civic responsibility by reporting this serious crime to the police,” said the letter, which was postmarked Aug. 3.
Wu Chi-wai, chairman of the Democratic Party, said in a phone interview that Lam had been transformed from victim to defendant. “This is a completely unreasonable situation,” he said.
During the attack, a group of men in white shirts entered the train station and struck unarmed commuters with wooden bats. Lam, 43, was filmed warning commuters in the station about the dangerous surroundings, but was later among those beaten and injured inside a stationary train carriage.
Hui, 38, frequently served as a mediator in the protests last year, issuing warnings to the police over a loudspeaker and encouraging protesters to go home safely. He filed a lawsuit against a police officer in June over the 2019 shooting of a protester, but the case was blocked last week by Hong Kong’s secretary of justice.
A few days after filing the suit, Hui was detained on suspicion of unlawful assembly, an accusation he described as retaliatory.

In Britain, an Idea to Reduce Racial Inequality Gains Momentum

Nearly two years ago, the British government seemed to be on the verge of doing something truly novel about racial and ethnic inequality. Theresa May, the prime minister at the time, had adopted a plan to root out one of the causes of differences in incomes that would “create a fairer and more diverse workforce,” she said.
It was October 2018, during Britain’s Black History Month. May suggested the government require companies and other large employers to report the disparities in pay among their employees based on ethnicity as they had recently been made to do for gender. She announced a three-month public comment period, or consultation, toward the goal of introducing a new regulation.
“Too often ethnic minority employees feel they’re hitting a brick wall when it comes to career progression,” May said.
Collecting and analyzing this data, which no other country seems to require, could enable companies to see disparities in pay and identify reasons, such as a lack of Black managers in senior positions, and do something about it.
But after the comment period closed in January 2019, little was heard about it.
Little, that is, until a surge of anti-racism protests this summer, provoked by the killing of George Floyd, revived the idea. In June, a petition to make ethnicity pay gap reporting mandatory amassed more than 100,000 signatures. In response, the government said that it would publish an update by the end of the year, having received more than 300 comments from businesses and other organizations.
The failure to demonstrate progress for a year and a half was not lost on David Isaac, the departing chair of the government’s Equality and Human Rights Commission. Last month, he said establishing the pay gap rule would be a quick win for the government as he accused it of “dragging its feet” on action to address racial and ethnic inequality.
Since Isaac’s chairmanship of the commission began four years ago, there have been three prime ministers from the same political party, two general elections, Brexit and a pandemic. There have also been four government-sponsored reviews focused on issues of ethnic inequality that have produced nearly 100 recommendations.
Isaac said that when he took over at the human rights commission, he believed he could achieve a lot, and he said he has since succeeded in helping more people fight legal battles for equal rights. But as he left his post, he still questioned why the government hadn’t taken advantage of a growing desire by businesses to do more to address inequality and urged for more action instead of reviews.
“The time for more recommendations, in my view, is over,” he told the BBC. “We know what needs to be done. Let’s get on with it.”
Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, said it was “just simply not true” that the government had dragged its heels on the issue. For example, she said, policymakers were working toward adopting most of the recommendations from a 2017 review of how “Black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals” were treated in the criminal justice system. Among the proposals was collecting more complete ethnicity data across the system and recruiting a more diverse prison staff.
In response to Black Lives Matter demonstrations, Johnson has also created a new commission focused on race and ethnic disparities that will make recommendations for government action by the end of the year. This new board will be a fresh start, Badenoch told the BBC.
“We’ve picked commissioners who haven’t really done this sort of review before so they wouldn’t be bringing in prejudged recommendations,” she said. “There must be no jumping to conclusions.”
She added that the commission would also look into why there was a public perception that the government hadn’t done enough to improve equality.
Amid mounting outrage about inequalities, ethnicity pay gap reporting is something that could be done quickly, Isaac said in an interview with The New York Times in early August, in part because of the work already done by May’s government to collect data about ethnic disparities across society.
Isaac is a lawyer who was once chair of the LGBT charity Stonewall. The Equality and Human Rights Commission he led is responsible for enforcing the 2017 legislation that makes it mandatory for companies, charities and public-sector organizations with more than 250 employees to publicly report the median and average pay difference between men and women on their payrolls each year. (Organizations were given a break this year, as the reporting deadline fell during the first weeks of lockdown to curb the pandemic.)
Since Johnson became prime minister, six months after the ethnicity consultation ended, the idea lost its urgency, possibly because leaving the European Union and tackling the coronavirus has consumed more of the government’s energy, Isaac said. But, he added, “this is a leadership issue and a real opportunity to move quickly, should the government really wish to do that.”
That said, there are additional challenges to reporting on ethnicity that are distinct from gender reporting. The thorniest issue is privacy. Employers have to get their staff to voluntarily disclose their ethnicity. There will also be companies that lack enough diversity to publish a nuanced breakdown of the data, or publish any data at all, without jeopardizing staff anonymity. (The government offers 18 different classifications of ethnic groups for census data in England and Wales.) And the severity of inequality and underrepresentation can really vary by region. Ethnic minorities make up just 14% of Britain’s total population, but in London, 40% of people identify as having Asian, Black, Arab or multiple ethnic backgrounds.
In response to the online petition on ethnicity pay gap reporting, the government said it had done voluntary testing of the methodology in 2019 with a range of businesses, which highlighted “the genuine difficulties” in designing a policy that provides accurate information and protects anonymity.
One way to get around some of these difficulties has been demonstrated by Deloitte, the auditing and financial advisory firm that is one of a handful of companies in Britain that has voluntarily published its own data.
Deloitte offers a single pay gap, showing the difference in pay between whites and all others. The latest report found that the median pay for the group it identified as Black, Asian and minority ethnic people in 2018 was 7.9% less than whites, compared with a 6.9% gap the year before. The gap for bonuses narrowed, to 25% from 30% in 2017. This report was made public, but internally more granular data was studied to help make decisions, said Clare Rowe, Deloitte U.K.’s head of inclusion.
A more detailed analysis is needed because a binary pay gap figure, modeled on how gender pay gap reporting is done, can conceal disparities between different ethnic groups. For example, according to a government survey, average hourly pay in Britain in 2018 was 11.82 pounds ($15.53). For white British people, it was 11.90 pounds and higher than that for people who are Indian. But Black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people received pay that was below the national average.
Business in the Community, a charity focused on responsible business practices, has been pushing for the government to require ethnicity pay gap reporting since 2018, when a study it did found that just 11% of people in Britain said their employer was collecting ethnicity pay data, and only half of those were then making it public.
Reporting this data “alone can’t fix everything, but it does ensure that this conversation remains at the top table and that there are actions to follow through on that,” said Sandra Kerr, the charity’s race equality director. “Because looking at the data, you can’t just sit back and say, ‘Oh, that’s really terrible.’ You then have to act and say what you are going to do.”
Last month, the government said it would announce by the end of the year how it planned to proceed. Some are not waiting: In the past two months, more than 150 companies have signed on to Business in the Community’s Race at Work Charter, according to Kerr. The charter encourages but does not require the firms to capture ethnicity data as a step toward publishing information on pay gaps.
Isaac is clear, however, that the requirement needs to be enforced.
“If it’s discretionary, the exemplars will do it and are already doing it,” he said.
But others won’t, given all the other pressures created by the pandemic, he said.
“There’s a general appetite now that has never existed in the same way before,” Isaac said. “COVID and the murder of George Floyd create that kind of tipping point when everybody has been shocked and everybody is keen to be an ally and do things. So why not take advantage of that?”

KENOSHA, Wis. — An Illinois resident has been arrested in connection to a shooting that left two people dead and another person wounded during a chaotic night of demonstrations over the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, officials said Wednesday.
A court document from Lake County, Illinois, shows that Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was arrested in Antioch, Illinois, on Wednesday morning after being charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the fatal shooting that took place only hours earlier. Antioch is about 30 minutes southwest of Kenosha, just over the Illinois line. More details were expected during a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
The shooting took place during a third night of protests over the shooting of Blake and after demonstrators clashed with law enforcement officials near the county courthouse downtown.
Tuesday evening was spent in a shifting, hourslong standoff between police and protesters. Protesters assembled outside a newly erected metal barrier protecting the courthouse and threw water bottles, rocks and fireworks at police.
Police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, repeatedly warning the crowd through a bullhorn that they were violating the city curfew of 8 p.m. and risking arrest. The crowd was eventually forced out of the park with tear gas and onto city streets, where the standoff continued.
Many protesters left the area, but others lingered and walked to a gas station several blocks away. There, a group of men with guns stood outside, promising to protect the property and verbally sparring with the arriving protesters. As the night stretched on, the gas station became a tense gathering spot, with bystanders watching from parked cars and people milling around in the street, arguing and occasionally shoving each other.
Police officers had crept closer to the gas station in armored trucks, urging the people who were still there to go home.
After midnight, shots were fired outside the gas station. Three people were struck, Sheriff David Beth said in an interview. The Kenosha Police Department said in a statement that there were two fatalities and that one person had been taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.
Beth said that the investigation was focused on the group of men with guns outside the gas station and that investigators were scouring video taken just before the shooting.
In one video, the men are shouting at each other, clutching their guns and occasionally pulling each other away to defuse the conflict.
“I’ve had people saying, ‘Why don’t you deputize citizens?’ ” he said. “This is why you don’t deputize citizens with guns to protect Kenosha.”
On Tuesday, the family of Blake, a Black resident whose children were nearby as their father was shot this week by a white police officer, had called for calm. Blake’s mother, Julia Jackson, had told reporters that she opposed the sort of destruction that had been left by protests spurred by her son’s shooting. On earlier nights, buildings and trucks had been burned down in Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people, where more than 100 members of the Wisconsin National Guard have been deployed amid the unrest.
Jackson told reporters that she had been praying for the country to heal.
“I’ve noticed a lot of damage,” she said. “It doesn’t reflect my son or my family.”
Blake, she and other family members said, is conscious in a hospital after being shot seven times. Family members and lawyers said that he was partially paralyzed from a bullet that severed his spinal cord and unaware of the protests that have spread across the country in his name.
Blake’s parents and siblings denounced the police and pleaded for justice.
It was a “senseless attempted murder,” Blake’s father, Jacob Blake Sr., said as he broke down and wept. “They shot my son seven times, like he didn’t matter.”
He said he had no confidence that the shooting of a Black man by a white officer would be fairly investigated.
That investigation is in the hands of the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation, which has not released basic information about the shooting, including the name of the officer, who has been placed on administrative leave.
The Kenosha Police Department, which has also declined to provide details of what happened, has been at the center of criticism from demonstrators, who protested for a third night Tuesday.

The month of June was filled with big moments for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
In that monthlong stretch, the Supreme Court rendered a sweeping decision providing workplace protections for gay and transgender people. It came shortly before the five-year anniversary of the high court’s landmark ruling on marriage equality. LGBTQ people and others commemorated the murder of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Florida in June 2016. Thousands marched in Brooklyn, New York, in support of Black transgender lives.
President Donald Trump was almost entirely silent through it all.
There was no tweet in honor of Pride Month, despite suggestions from several aides to Trump that he write one. No rollout of a coalition aimed at LGBTQ voters by his campaign, despite preparations that had been made for one. Embassies overseas were told they couldn’t fly the community’s gay pride flag.
There was, however, a rollback by the Trump administration of a regulation put in place by the Obama administration in 2016 to mandate health care as a civil right for transgender patients under the Affordable Care Act.
It is what many in the LGBTQ coalition have come to expect from Trump, who during his 2016 presidential campaign used gay people as a wedge against Muslims, whom he painted broadly as extremists, following the shootings at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub by a Muslim man. While Trump has signaled a willingness to publicly align himself with some gay men and women, he selected a deeply conservative running mate in Vice President Mike Pence and as president has systematically dismantled protections implemented by President Barack Obama, especially for transgender people.
Just over two months before Election Day, Trump is trailing in almost every poll to Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, whom activists credit with pushing Obama to support same-sex marriage. And Trump’s advisers are suddenly talking about LGBTQ people as they scramble to find new voter support.
Last weekend, the campaign announced the LGBTQ coalition that had been expected in June, blaming the delay on the coronavirus.
And now Trump officials are turning to Richard Grenell, the openly gay former U.S. ambassador to Germany who served for three months as the acting director of national intelligence, to sell the president and attack Biden.
Grenell, whom Trump likes in part because he declassified material related to the investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russian officials in 2016, appeared in a video released by the Log Cabin Republicans, a group that “represents LGBT conservatives.” Grenell, whose praise for Trump and criticisms of Biden’s record were deemed dishonest by the Washington Post fact-checker, is expected to speak at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night.
Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ civil rights group, responded, “We’re not taking the bait.”
For years, now, David said, the president has tried to divide the coalition by targeting transgender people in particular, with actions that affect the entire coalition.
“The Trump administration is looking to drive a wedge within the LGBTQ community between LGB and T,” David said.
Tori Cooper, the group’s director of community engagement for the transgender justice initiative, said that the administration is especially focused on people who have the least protection in society, transgender people of color.
“It shows the cowardice — that’s the word I like to use of the current president,” Cooper said.
The targeting of transgender people has extended across the federal government: a ban on transgender service in the military, an effort at the Education Department to block transgender students from choosing which bathroom to use, the rollback of health care protections by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Justice Department’s move to end protections for transgender people in federal prisons.
Last month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed allowing homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to single-sex shelters, and this month, the Education Department’s office of civil rights publicly moved to block transgender girls from joining female track teams in Connecticut high schools.
Grenell, in the video, cited almost no specific domestic policy accomplishment that Trump achieved on LGBTQ rights, as he made the pitch that Trump is the “most pro-gay president in American history.” Instead, Grenell referred to his own appointment as well as to the president’s acceptance of the Supreme Court’s ruling of same-sex marriage as constitutional and his efforts to push countries that criminalize being gay to end those practices. In the video, Grenell specifically mentioned gays and lesbians but not transgender people.
And the night before Grenell’s scheduled speech, a convention speaker praised Trump for his administration’s revocation of some protections for transgender students.
To describe Trump as supportive of gay people because he appointed Grenell is the essence of “tokenism,” David said.
“It’s actually offensive,” he said, “because you are appointing someone but removing all the rights associated with that identity.”
Some administration officials have acknowledged that they see targeting transgender rights as different from gay rights.
In a statement, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said, “While the radical left has pushed false and disgusting accusations that LGBT Americans, which includes me, are threatened under this administration, that could not be further from the truth.”
Judd said that Trump has hired LGBTQ people across the government, mentioning Grenell again; cited the president’s commitment at last year’s State of the Union address to ending HIV transmissions in the country by 2030; and said the president “launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality, standing in solidarity with all LGBT people who live in dozens of counties around the globe that punish, imprison and even execute individuals based on their sexual orientation.”
There’s no evidence that Trump’s campaign to decriminalize homosexuality has had any effect or that it’s been substantially different from what Obama had attempted. For instance, White House officials declined to say whether Trump had raised the brutal anti-gay purges by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, with whom he has spoken several times in recent months. His HIV pledge was similarly met with skepticism.
Trump is famously transactional, and the support he has given LGBTQ people has usually been in connection with celebrity or support they have given him.
Trump allowed gay members into his Florida club Mar-a-Lago as long as they could pay the exorbitant membership fee; he broadcast donations to groups like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis when the AIDS epidemic became a celebrity cause; and he publicly embraced the civil union between singer Elton John, someone whose music and fame Trump admires, and John’s longtime partner, David Furnish.
In 2015, when Trump was just a few months into the Republican primary contest, some of his advisers discussed a plan for exiting the campaign if his poll numbers dropped. The plan, according to one person with direct knowledge of the discussions, was for Trump to say that the party did not agree with him on a number of issues, including same-sex marriage, even though he had never publicly supported it.
But after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, his advisers knew he needed the support of evangelical voters. So in an interview with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in 2016, Trump said, “I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, from New York, it’s like, how you can be against gay marriage? But I’m opposed to gay marriage.”
Christine Quinn, the first openly gay speaker of the New York City Council, said Trump’s New York business background makes his actions as president “worse — because he knows better.”
As president, Trump has not demagogued LGBTQ issues the way he has with immigrants, Muslims and Black people protesting systemic police brutality.
But Trump’s embrace of initiatives promoting religious freedom has been used by people inside and outside his government to justify discrimination against gay and transgender people.
Over many years, Trump has been skeptical about whether he gets any political benefit from the LGBTQ community, turning frequently to Pence, who was Trump’s bridge to evangelical voters in 2016, for advice, according to administration officials. Those are the voters Trump is most anxious about losing.
Charles Moran, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, conceded that he would have preferred that Trump acknowledge Pride Month in June. But he maintained that the president is being treated unfairly and said that Obama’s pro-LGBTQ regulations were legal overreach.
“The LGBT left and what I call ‘Gay Inc.’ has hijacked the narrative,” Moran said, adding that he himself had to get educated quickly on transgender-related issues. He accused groups like the Human Rights Campaign of being unwilling to engage with the White House.
“My phone calls get returned” by the White House, he said. “There is a genuine willingness to work with us in our community.”
The Log Cabin Republicans did not endorse Trump in 2016, and the group’s current support has caused a rift within its ranks. Jerri Ann Henry, the group’s first woman executive director, resigned in August 2019 over the pending endorsement.
“Ultimately what should be promised is not devotion to a specific class or group of people but dedication to the set of principles,” she said, “and Trump has not shown his devotion to that set of principles.”
Last month, Trump was questioned about whether he would consider rescinding his ban on transgender people entering the military by a reporter for The Washington Blade, a gay newspaper.
Trump gestured to his chin, appearing to signal the reporter’s mask was muffling him.
“I can’t hear you,” Trump said. “I can’t hear a word you’re saying.” He never answered the question.

KENOSHA, Wis. — In some ways, what has unfolded on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the past week has had a wearying sense of familiarity.
There was another demoralizing shooting of a Black man by the police, another angry outcry in the streets, another disturbing trail of destruction that had the potential to overshadow the message of the need to end police violence and racism.
But as the demonstrations for Jacob Blake, the man shot in Kenosha, spread nationwide this week, and as civil rights leaders prepare to host tens of thousands of people in a March on Washington on Friday, this latest surge of protests reflects something much more — the remarkable way that the Black Lives Matter movement has come to represent a lever for change and a guiding voice on issues of race in America.
Black Lives Matter protests — or even the possibility of them — have changed the way that people in power respond. Elected leaders, including Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, now tend to engage instantly and insistently with matters that in the past had been dealt with primarily by the police. Officers are named, details are shared and there are promises of thorough investigations — on Wednesday, by the Justice Department. In some instances, officers are charged or fired much more quickly than ever before.
And there is broader public witness and involvement. After a series of police killings several years ago, Colin Kaepernick imperiled his National Football League career by kneeling during the national anthem. Now, kneeling has become widely accepted in professional sports, athletes have refused to play games and players seriously debated shutting down the National Basketball Association playoffs entirely to make a statement.
“You’ve created an environment so whenever any incident of injustice or perceived injustice takes place, it’s going to be amplified,” said Daniel Gillion, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who studies protest movements.
Still, even as activists continue taking to the streets, many also believe that the changes are too slow and too modest. There is frustration over what protesters feel is the police’s continued unnecessary use of force against Black people.
But there is also increasing concern that images of vandalism, looting and arson are becoming inextricably linked with the protests, undermining efforts to win systemic reforms and public support. While the Black Lives Matter movement enjoyed broad approval in the weeks after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody, Democrats worry that the unrest, regardless of its extent or who is responsible, could help President Donald Trump find a receptive audience for his argument that he will bring “law and order” to the country.
“We always must find ways to have peaceful demonstrations,” said Martin Luther King III, the son of the slain civil rights leader and an organizer of Friday’s march, which celebrates the 57th anniversary of the historic gathering his father led in Washington.
“While I don’t condone violence at all, I understand why people are resorting to violence,” he added. “You are victimizing a person as a society, and then you want to tell them, ‘You know, I got my foot on your neck, but you’re just supposed to let me put my foot on your neck.’ That’s not right.”
In the two weeks after Floyd was killed in May, more than 2,000 protests were held across all 50 states. The demonstrations were diverse, reaching both big cities and communities that were rural and overwhelmingly white. On June 6 alone there were at least 531 protests nationwide, according to Count Love, a database of protests since 2017.
The speed at which the protests of the last three months have spread and the scale of support they have received speak to the foundation that the Black Lives Matter movement has laid over the past several years, academics said.
The movement traces its origins to the killing of Trayvon Martin, a Black 17-year-old, by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012. But it really took off after a police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.
For more than a year, protests flared up with new police killings. The Justice Department investigated police departments across the country and reached settlements with some to monitor their operations. Some police forces introduced new policies, like making their officers wear body cameras.
Even after much of the media attention faded from the Black Lives Matter movement after Trump’s election in 2016, organizing and policy work continued. So when the devastating video surfaced of Floyd suffocating as an officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes, the infrastructure was there for activists to spring into action, experts said.
“Part of what’s going on this spring is continuity from six years ago,” said Pamela Oliver, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Groups had actually never stopped. All those street protests that were happening 2014 to 2016 died down after the fall election, but the issue didn’t die down.”
So far, this latest swell of activism is showing a durability that outpaces even the surge after Brown’s killing.
There have been more than 70 protests per week this month — which is two months removed from Floyd’s killing — according to the Count Love database, compiled using media reports. When Brown was killed in August 2014, there was a surge of more than 100 protests nationwide the week after, according to a different database, but that dropped to an average of about 15 per week for the rest of the month.
The recent persistence of Black Lives Matter demonstrations is partly the result of broader grievances in society, including the feeling among many on the left that Trump represents a threat to democracy, experts said. Youth activism in recent years on issues like climate change and gun rights has helped to cultivate a broader protest culture, experts said, and when reforms are won, it validates protesting as an effective action. Support from prominent celebrities and athletes also have helped to keep the momentum going.
“I definitely think it’s still at the same energy level,” Damayanti Wallace, 19, an organizer in Chicago, said of the protests in her hometown. “I think that youth especially are just very angry with the lack of progress that’s been happening in the city.”
Portland, Oregon, has become a center of the current protest movement — representing both its power and its challenges. Demonstrations have taken place every night for more than three months, but they have been reliably marred by confrontation with the police.
Even though most protesters stick to chanting the names of Black victims of police violence and shouting demands for reform, some who identify with the anti-fascist movement wear body armor, carry homemade shields and proudly call themselves “Antifa Super Soldiers.” The police say they have spent $6.7 million responding to the protests since May, and have been so overburdened that response times to nonemergency calls can take as long as 12 hours.
It remains to be seen how long the Black Lives Matter movement will continue to be a central part of the social and political landscape. Analysts say the movement could take on a yearslong trajectory, much like the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War.
As Anthony Sturino, 24, marched in Kenosha on Wednesday night while clutching a handwritten sign that read, “Feds go home, this is our city,” he said the energy of the continued protests there would not have been possible without the spark after Floyd’s death. There had been several police shootings in Kenosha over the years that were largely ignored, he said.
“If those had not happened, we would never be this big. People still would not be caring about Black lives,” said Sturino, a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside outside Kenosha. “It took George Floyd to get people to pay attention, and now people are paying attention.”

March on Washington 2020: Protesters Hope to Rekindle Spirit of 1963

WASHINGTON — Hours after President Donald Trump commanded the South Lawn of the White House to rail against what he called agitators bent on destroying “the American way of life,” thousands of Americans streamed Friday morning to the Lincoln Memorial, not a mile away, for what frequently seemed a forceful reply.
The Commitment March, as its organizers are calling it, was devised in part to build on the passion for racial justice that Martin Luther King Jr. summoned when he delivered his “I Have a Dream” address on that same spot 57 years ago. Early speeches from the podium at the base of the memorial by union leaders, civil rights advocates and Black ministers cast Trump as the prime obstacle to their goal — and voting to remove him as the first step toward a solution.
“November is coming, and we have work to do,” said Kyra Stephenson-Valley, a policy adviser at the National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by one organizer of the march, the Rev. Al Sharpton. She asked attendees to scan their tickets to check their voter registration status.
Frank Nitty was one of a group of Black civil rights advocates who marched 750 miles from Milwaukee to be at Friday’s demonstration. “My grandson isn’t going to be marching for the same thing my granddaddy marched for,” he told the crowd. “We’ve got to vote Trump out of office, right?”
That call and others drew cheers from the crowd, which gathered in shady spots in socially distanced clumps, clad in masks to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.
“It’s good against evil at this point,” said Ruby Williams, 67, a retired corrections officer from Frederick, Maryland, who said she was voting for Trump’s opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, in November.
King’s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom drew an audience of a quarter-million. The Friday protest, called the Commitment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks, appeared to attract a fraction of that number, in part because the city is requiring quarantines for visitors from 27 states. Attendees were screened for fever, and hand-sanitizing stations were ubiquitous.
A permit issued by the city Tuesday indicated that 50,000 people might attend the protest.
The organizers, led by Sharpton and King’s oldest son, Martin Luther King III, said it would be a mistake to judge the event’s success by the size of its crowd.
“I’m confident that but for COVID we would have had a million people,” said Marc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor who is president of the National Urban League, a sponsor of the march. “We will have, however, millions virtually, and millions tuning in on TV, and millions online.”
The march “has to be understood as a moment for which these protests must lead to something,” he added. “So it must lead to significant policy change. Structural racism is not addressed with talk or goodwill alone.”
On Friday King cast Trump as “a president who confuses grandiosity with greatness” and opts for chaos over community.
“We need you to vote as if your lives, our livelihoods, our liberties depend on it. Because they do,” he told the crowd. “There’s a knee upon the neck of democracy, and our nation can only live so long without the oxygen of freedom.”
Sharpton invoked Jacob Blake, who was shot by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, and the Black shooting victims before him to demand a new national reckoning over hate and bigotry.
“We didn’t come to start trouble,” he said. “We came to stop trouble. You act like it’s no trouble to shoot us in the back. You act like it’s no trouble to put a chokehold on us while we scream, ‘I can’t breathe,’ 11 times.
“Mr. Trump, look right down the block from the White House,” he added. “We’ve come to Washington by the thousands. We’re going to call their name. We’ll never let America forget what you’ve done.”
While the protest commemorated the 1963 march, its larger purpose was to rally African Americans and others on behalf of concrete goals. Those aims include increasing voter registration and participation in the 2020 census and enacting a new version of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, said Tylik McMillan, national director of youth and college at the National Action Network, which Sharpton founded in 1991.
A major goal, he said, is to push for passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, backed by House Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus, which would overhaul law enforcement training and conduct rules to limit police misconduct and racial bias.
The killing of Floyd by Minneapolis police in May and the national upheaval it provoked loom large over the march, as does the sense among civil rights leaders that action this year could set the course of American race relations for years, if not decades.
“We can’t ignore the moment that we’re in,” said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which also was sponsoring the protest. “This is a march that is very much needed right now, given the fires that are raging as we deal with police violence, racial violence and voter suppression. It’s created almost a perfect storm.”

NEW YORK — Little is known about the New Yorker described in an 1776 advertisement seeking the return of a runaway slave beyond his given name (James), what he looked like (tall and thin, with bloodshot eyes) and that he was talkative.
James’ owner, Dr. Samuel Bard, is less obscure. He was a major figure in New York medical circles at the time, President George Washington’s doctor and a founder of Columbia University’s medical school. He also delivered Alexander Hamilton’s son Philip.
When Columbia opened a dormitory for medical students in Upper Manhattan in 1931, Bard’s name went on it as a tribute to his contributions to the university.
Now — nearly 90 years later, amid a summer of protests against racial injustice and as elite universities and other institutions continue to confront their ties to slavery — his name is about to come off.
On Friday, Lee Bollinger, the university’s president, said in a letter to students and faculty members that the dorm, Bard Hall, would be renamed this fall. A new name has not yet been chosen, and Bollinger’s letter did not offer details about the process for picking one.
“Of course, we cannot, indeed should not, erase Samuel Bard’s contributions to the medical school,” Bollinger wrote. “But we must not recall this history without also recognizing the reason for our decision to rename Bard Hall.”
The events that led to the announcement Friday began in 2015, when Columbia students and faculty members, at Bollinger’s direction, began a research project delving into the university’s connections to slavery and how slave-trade profits had helped fund the school.
The push gained momentum this summer after the police killing of George Floyd inspired Raymond Givens, an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia, to start an online petition calling for Bard Hall’s name to be changed and writing to Bollinger and other university officials about the matter.
Givens, who is Black, said that he and others had been frustrated by the university’s failure to drop Bard’s name sooner given that his slave ownership was detailed several years ago.
He also said changing the building’s name was just one step among many that Columbia — where about 5% of the medical students enrolled last fall were Black — needed to take to atone for its past.
“It is the first part of what needs to be a much longer slate of commitments to move the university forward,” Givens said.
The move was the second one in recent weeks involving a Columbia-affiliated school shedding a name over racist or other offensive ideas and actions. Teachers College at Columbia University, which has its own board of trustees, voted in July to remove the name of Edward L. Thorndike, who promoted eugenics and sexist and anti-Semitic ideas, from a building there.
Columbia is the latest top university to begin to take concrete, if modest, steps to address its ties to slavery, whether through ownership of slaves or a reliance on slave-trade revenue.
In 2003, Brown University created a committee dedicated to exploring its relationship with slavery. In 2016, Georgetown University started a project to determine what had become of 272 men, women and children who were sold in the slave trade to keep the university from financial ruin, and what the university might owe their descendants.
A year later, Yale University renamed Calhoun College, which had been named for Vice President John C. Calhoun, who called slavery a “positive good.”
The revisiting of names over race has not been limited to universities’ slave ties. In June, after resisting for several years, Princeton University dropped President Woodrow Wilson’s name from a campus building, citing his racist policies.
Eric Foner, a professor emeritus of history at Columbia who led the research project into the university’s links to slavery, said the ties ran much deeper than the name of Bard Hall, although he said the decision to rename the building was a “wise move.”
“The money from slavery goes way back in Columbia’s history,” he said, adding that the university itself did not own slaves.
Bard’s name figured prominently in the project, Foner said, because of his contributions to the university and because he owned eight slaves, including James, the subject of the runaway-slave ad (Bard offered a $10 reward for his return).
“Samuel Bard was a pretty significant slave owner by New York standards,” Foner said.
Suzanne Goldberg, Columbia’s executive vice president of university life, said that a committee had recommended the renaming of Bard Hall this summer and that the change was part of the university’s “renewed focus” on, and broader commitment to, fighting racism.
Goldberg said Columbia would be reviewing other names and symbols attached to its physical structures and that more changes were possible.
“We are in a time of important renewed attention to our built environment.” she said. “And this is part of that process.”
For Givens, there was a personal aspect to getting Bard Hall’s name changed: His son Lucas attended nursery school in the building.
“Names matter,” Givens said. That, he added, was why “when people protest these police killings, the chant is, ‘Say their names.’”

Biden, Speaking to National Guard, Takes Aim at Republican Criticism on Crime

After a Republican National Convention week in which President Donald Trump and his allies sought to brand Joe Biden as radically anti-law enforcement, the Democratic nominee took implicit aim at that characterization in his own remarks on Saturday as he swiped at Trump’s calls for “law and order” and ripped the president’s record as commander in chief.
Biden’s comments came at a virtual gathering of the National Guard Association of the United States, a group he addressed while speaking against a backdrop of American flags, with a flag pin affixed to his suit lapel.
Civil and military relations have been “tested lately,” Biden argued, alluding to Trump’s efforts earlier this summer to use federal law enforcement to “dominate” demonstrators protesting police brutality amid a national outcry over racial injustice. Republicans in recent days have seized on renewed unrest in American cities to argue falsely that Biden wants to defund the police, an approach he opposes.
“I promise you, as president, I’ll never put you in the middle of politics, or personal vendettas,” Biden said. “I’ll never use the military as a prop or as a private militia to violate rights of fellow citizens. That’s not law and order. You don’t deserve that.”
Biden, who has been a firm supporter of peaceful protests, is expected to travel on Monday to condemn violence, and to note that chaos has unfolded on Trump’s watch, according to someone familiar with his plans. He is also expected to charge more broadly that the president is seeking to change the subject from the coronavirus and economic challenges the country faces. Details of his Monday plans weren’t immediately clear.
On Saturday, he also got some cover on the left from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who at once praised Biden’s candidacy and policy positions and stressed the ways he and Biden “disagree on a number of issues.” The comments reflect the Democrats’ delicate balancing act as they try to keep their moderate and progressive wings united at the same time that Republicans are trying to portray Biden and his party as too progressive.
In Sanders’ speech, which was broadcast over livestream, he denounced Trump’s handling of the economy during the pandemic. Sanders, the standard-bearer for the party’s left wing, then commended several of Biden’s proposals that he said would “go a long, long way in improving life for working families.”
Among the policies that he called attention to were Biden’s support for a $15 federal minimum wage, equal pay for women, investment in infrastructure and universal prekindergarten. And while Sanders prefers a single-payer “Medicare for all” health care system — which Biden does not support — he also offered some praise for Biden’s health care proposal.
“While Joe Biden and I disagree on the best path to get to universal coverage, his proposal will greatly expand access to health care, and make it more affordable for tens of millions across this country,” Sanders said, specifically highlighting Biden’s proposal to lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 60 and expand Medicare to include coverage of dental care, eyeglasses and hearing aides.
But if Sanders’ remarks were intended to unify his supporters behind Biden nine weeks before the general election, he also went out of his way to present Biden as a moderate. All of the Biden policies that Sanders noted were widely acceptable liberal proposals. Sanders made plain that he and Biden were not ideologically aligned, in a clear effort to defend Biden from Republican attempts to cast him as a “Trojan horse for socialism.”
“Joe Biden and I have differences of opinion, and that is no great secret. It is no great secret that Joe and I disagree on a number of issues,” Sanders said, before lauding Biden’s economic plan.
Trump and Republicans have repeatedly sought to misleadingly paint Biden, a relative moderate, as captured by Sanders and the far left, and never more so than during their convention last week. “If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many many, we see them all the time,” Trump said in his convention speech. “It is incredible, actually. Then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He’s not.”
Trump also referred to a “Biden-Bernie manifesto,” an apparent reference to the recommendations that the Biden-Sanders joint policy task forces had put forth in July. But while those proposals — on health care, the economy, criminal justice, education, immigration and climate change — indicated deep cooperation among the moderate and progressive wings of the party, they largely hewed to policies Biden and his allies already supported, frustrating some in the party’s activist wing who believed they did not go far enough.
As he has done countless times since he dropped out of the presidential race in early April, Sanders closed his remarks with an urgent plea to elect Biden.
“This is a moment in history that all of us must stand together — Black and white, Latino, Asian American and Native American,” he said. “We must stand together, we must defeat Donald Trump. We must elect Joe Biden as our next president, and we must create an economy that lifts our people up.”
In his own remarks Saturday, Biden, whose late son, Beau Biden, served in the Delaware National Guard, spoke passionately about the sacrifices made by those deployed both abroad and at home, acknowledging that among many other responsibilities, “you’ve been called out to help keep the peace as the country continues to struggle and overcome our racial justice crisis.”
National Guard troops were deployed to Kenosha, Wisconsin, this week, a city that erupted in protests, some of which turned destructive, after a police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake.
Biden also tore into the president’s handling of the intelligence regarding Russian bounty offers to kill American troops and pledged to be a staunch supporter of the National Guard as president.
“I can’t imagine the sense of betrayal of parents of our women and men deployed in Afghanistan felt when that news broke, to know that the president still hasn’t even raised the issue with Vladimir Putin,” he said. “I know Putin. He knows I’ll do more than raise it. If I have the honor of serving as commander in chief of the finest military in the history of the world, our troops and their families will never, never have to wonder what side I’m on.”

Portland, Oregon, has had nightly protests since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
On Saturday night, a caravan of supporters of President Donald Trump traveled through the city, clashing with counterprotesters. A man was shot and killed during the unrest.
Here is what we know so far.
What happened in Portland?
Supporters of the president gathered Saturday at a shopping center a few miles southeast of Portland. The caravan of hundreds of trucks then traveled into the city. Most were flying “Trump 2020” or thin blue line flags, which are commonly associated with support for the police and often seen as antithetical to the Black Lives Matter movement.
The caravan clashed with counterprotesters at times. People shot paintball guns from trucks and protesters threw objects at them. Some conflicts devolved into fistfights in the streets. A video showed a small group in the street, where gunfire erupts and a man collapses.
Police Chief Chuck Lovell said the caravan stretched for miles and there were pockets of violence. Police tried to take precautionary measures to prevent vehicles from making their way downtown.
“We have limited resources,” Lovell said at a news conference Sunday. “We can’t be everywhere at the same time.”
Portland police officers heard reports of gunfire shortly before 9 p.m. local time and found a man with a gunshot wound to the chest, police said.
Medical responders determined that the man was dead, police said.
Officials asked people to not jump to conclusions about what happened and to stay away from Portland as some have expressed a desire to seek retribution.
Who was the man who died?
The man’s identity has not been released.
He was wearing a hat with the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a far-right group based in the Portland area. The group says it seeks to combat “corruption, big government and tyranny, using God for strength and the power of love,” according to its Facebook page, which has more than 40,000 followers.
A Patriot Prayer leader, Joey Gibson, said Sunday that the man was a good friend and a supporter of the group, but he did not offer further details.
Do we know who the gunman was?
Police have not released information about who fired the shots.
Lovell said Sunday that police were “working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible.”
Police said Sunday that they had concluded an investigation of the shooting scene and asked witnesses or those with video of the episode to contact detectives.
What else has been happening in Portland?
Protests have occurred nightly in the city since the killing of Floyd in May.
In recent weeks, right- and left-wing groups have clashed. On Aug. 22, a demonstration outside the U.S. courthouse in Portland turned violent as right-wing demonstrators, including Proud Boys members, clashed with Black Lives Matter protesters. Objects were thrown, paintballs were fired and shouting turned to shoving and punching.
The city is no stranger to demonstrations that devolve into chaos, often stoked by conflicts with police or between opposing groups.
In 2016, protests over Trump’s election were marred by vandalism and fires. The unrest was labeled a riot by police, who deployed pepper spray and rubber “distraction devices” against the crowd.
In August 2018, Gibson led a demonstration that drew hundreds of Patriot Prayer supporters, many from outside the state, The Oregonian reported. Counterprotesters were ordered by police to disperse before officers deployed flash-bang grenades and shoved counterprotesters out of the street.
Last month, camouflaged federal agents were sent to the city, against the wishes of local authorities.
What has Trump said about the situation?
Trump has not spoken specifically about the shooting death in Portland, but on Sunday morning he retweeted a message that said Portland “needs to be federalized at this point.”
Trump added to the message: “The National Guard is Ready, Willing and Able. All the Governor has to do is call!”
In another tweet, Trump said the “big backlash going on in Portland cannot be unexpected.” He called Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, “incompetent” and “a FOOL,” adding that “the people of Portland won’t put up with no safety any longer.”
On Sunday afternoon, the mayor sharply criticized Trump, saying the president wanted Wheeler to “stop the violence that you helped create.”
“Do you wonder, Mr. President, why this is the first time in decades that Americans have seen this level of violence?” Wheeler said. “It’s you who have created the hate and the division.”
Wheeler said the caravan was “supported and energized” by Trump.
“I’d appreciate that either the president support us or he stay the hell out of the way,” Wheeler said.

In Massachusetts, Markey Outflanks Kennedy by Running as Bold Insurgent

BOSTON — Stepping out of the rain on a dreary Saturday morning, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III made no attempt to hide his frustration as he raced from neighborhood to neighborhood in a city as synonymous with his family as it is with the Green Monster.
Kennedy is trailing Sen. Edward J. Markey in every poll ahead of the Senate primary on Tuesday, and may become the first Kennedy to lose a race in Massachusetts. He is struggling with idealistic young liberals and older, affluent white Democrats, the sort of voters who in an earlier era idolized his grandfather, Robert F. Kennedy, and his great-uncles.
Kennedy pointed to his strength with working-class Democrats and voters of color who are bearing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic, all but scorning what he suggested was the hypocrisy of white liberals.
“For a progressive left that says that they care about these racial inequities, these structural inequities, economic inequities, health care inequities, the folks that are on the other side of that are overwhelmingly supporting me in this race,” he said. “Yet there seems to be a cognitive dissonance.”
It wasn’t supposed to be this way — at least not in the minds of Massachusetts Democrats, who have spent a lifetime watching a parade of Kennedys win elections against little opposition. When Kennedy first considered leaving his House seat last year to challenge Markey in a primary race, some in the party wondered if the 74-year-old incumbent would step aside for the 39-year-old political scion.
Instead, Markey, who was elected to the House before Kennedy was born, has harnessed the energy of the ascendant left and wielded his rival’s gilded legacy against him. And he has used his support from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whom he featured in an ad, and their joint authorship of the Green New Deal to establish himself as the clear front-runner.
That backing may help him avoid the fate of other longtime incumbents upended by young progressives, among them Rep. William Lacy Clay of Missouri, who was defeated in a primary contest in August, and Joseph Crowley of New York, who was stunned by Ocasio-Cortez two years ago.
Markey’s strength illustrates the growing clout of progressives in the Democratic Party, particularly in states and districts that are heavily metropolitan and filled with well-educated voters. Each of the Democrats who have unseated incumbents in primaries in 2018 or this year did so in House seats anchored in cities or close-in suburbs, which is where most of the votes in Massachusetts can be found.
What is so striking about the Senate race here, though, is that it is the incumbent who framed himself as the bold insurgent.
Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsement provided the validation for that approach, Markey said.
“When she said, ‘It’s not your age but the age of your ideas,’ when she said that Ed Markey was the generational change that we have been waiting for, it helped to make clear that in this race I am the youngest guy because it’s about ideas,” Markey said, grinning through his Boston brogue.
The contest has grown ugly in the final weeks, as Kennedy has highlighted Markey’s history on racial justice issues and Markey has been urged to quiet supporters online who have made jokes about the assassinations of the congressman’s grandfather and his great-uncle, John F. Kennedy. It has also divided Democratic leaders in the state and in Washington, where Sen. Chuck Schumer is supporting Markey while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is backing Kennedy.
The outcome of the race is not totally clear. Hundreds of thousands of people have already cast early ballots to avoid polling places because of the coronavirus outbreak, and supporters of both candidates agree that Kennedy’s prospects depend entirely on a primary-day surge of mostly nonwhite Democrats who vote more sporadically than those in Markey’s hyper-engaged base.
It won’t come easy, though: Markey was outspending Kennedy nearly 4 to 1 on commercials in the Boston market in the final week of the campaign.
That Markey has rebranded himself as an avatar of the millennial left is a cause of considerable wonder to longtime Massachusetts politicians, including some of his former colleagues.
“Markey has done a very skillful job of reinventing himself — as a politician I have admiration for the skill he’s done it with,” said former Rep. Barney Frank, who served for decades with Markey and was succeeded by Kennedy but is supporting neither. “He was to Pelosi’s right.”
Less amused by Markey’s pivot is Kennedy. With undisguised exasperation, he rattles off his rival’s support for the 1990s-era crime bill, the Iraq War and the Patriot Act, and for his early-career opposition to the integration of Boston’s schools. “All of these votes are what the left has held Vice President Biden to account for,” he pointed out.
However, Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, benefited in the presidential primary race from a more pragmatic electorate that was fixated on defeating President Donald Trump.
Markey, conversely, has been able to forge a coalition that includes a number of onetime supporters of Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who together won over 48% of the vote in Massachusetts’ multicandidate presidential primary this year.
Also crucial to Markey, who joined the Senate after John Kerry left the seat to become secretary of state in 2013, has been a successful digital operation. His staff used the work-from-home months, when most voters were glued to screens, to cast him as something of a unintentional hipster who still wears chunky 1989 Nike Air Revolutions.
It is one of the few areas where Kennedy and Markey agree — the incumbent’s ability to link the very online left with local Democratic officials who swear by incumbency.
“We’ve taken the established leaders and partnered them with the digerati,” Markey said in an interview in Brockton, Massachusetts, where he held an outdoor rally just steps away from the statue of the hometown hero Rocky Marciano.
Back in Boston, Kennedy said much the same.
“There was a combination of an insurgent left supporting the senator and a more establishment left that doesn’t like primaries, where he was able to kind of unify them both,” he said of his opponent.
Kennedy, to the dismay of some of his supporters, was reluctant to embrace his family legacy for much of the campaign. He eschewed the barely veiled appeals of his predecessors, like former Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who boasted of his connections during his first Senate campaign with the slogan “He Can Do More for Massachusetts.”
Only after Markey made a few unmistakable references to the Kennedys — including in an ad that concluded “With all due respect, it’s time to start asking what your country can do for you” — did the congressman give a speech and air commercials invoking his relatives.
Those appeals, however, do little to sway Markey’s young admirers, many of whom were not even eligible to vote the last time a Kennedy ran statewide here, in 2006.
“He’s trying to ride this progressive wave, the young progressives that are upending older candidates,” said Molly Ohman, 27, who came to cheer on Markey in Brockton and deemed the Kennedy challenge “ageism.”
For his part, Markey steadfastly avoids mentioning his opponent’s name. When he is asked about the Kennedy family legacy, he invariably invokes his own blue-collar roots as the son of a milk truck driver, “a Markey from Malden,” drawing the contrast implicitly if not subtly.
This appeal helps reinforce one of Kennedy’s most significant weaknesses in today’s Democratic electorate — the perception that he is the candidate of privilege.
“It turns out being named Joe Kennedy is a mixed blessing,” Frank quipped.
Of course, many of the voters most likely to be moved by contempt for privilege tend to be more upscale themselves, while polls indicate that Kennedy is embraced by many working-class voters — white and nonwhite — who haven’t thumbed through “White Fragility.”
In a recognition of this searing moment of reckoning over race, and his need to respond to Kennedy’s attacks on his record on issues like school integration and the crime bill, Markey has infused his closing stump speech with tributes to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a call for reparations and praise for the athletes protesting police brutality.
“Democracy is not shared as long as Black and brown men continue to get shot, injured or murdered in the streets by police officers supposed to protect them,” he said in Brockton, lamenting what he called “a criminal injustice system.”
Markey has also reoriented his schedule in the campaign’s closing days to more aggressively court voters of color.
On Saturday, he stood in a diverse Boston enclave before a group of Black ministers and one of his most prominent Black supporters: the Suffolk County district attorney, Rachael Rollins.
Rollins acknowledged after the event that the Kennedy name still resonated with many voters of color, and said she wished Markey had done more to appeal to minority voters.
“We can be messaging better,” she said.
But she called Kennedy’s challenge “selfish” and suggested he was running now only to avoid a future Senate primary race against Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who unseated a longtime Democratic incumbent two years ago. “I’d be shocked if Ayanna didn’t jump,” Rollins said of Pressley’s Senate ambitions.
As he hunted for votes in Boston, Kennedy found his most enthusiastic support from Black voters and older whites with memories of his forebears.
“The Kennedys have a legacy here, they’ve been good to Massachusetts,” said Patricia McCormack, 69, whose first husband was the nephew of the former Speaker John W. McCormack, another Massachusetts legend.
Kennedy was viewed just as warmly as he rallied union supporters in Dorchester, where black and white images on a wall inside the IBEW hall include a picketer in a hard hat wearing a “Kennedy” T-shirt.
Perhaps more revealing was the polite but largely unenthusiastic reaction he got in South Boston, the historically Irish neighborhood that has become increasingly gentrified. As he strode around the cafes and brunch spots that now dot Whitey Bulger’s old neighborhood, many of the younger voters were noncommittal.
Jose Luna, a 26-year-old immigration lawyer who went to Boston College with a Kennedy cousin, was one of the few millennials who approached him for a selfie.
But as he walked away, Luna declined to say whom he was supporting. “I’ll be voting,” he said. “I’m just not going to talk about it.”

Bria Hartley has been like many working mothers during the coronavirus pandemic. Her 3-year-old son, Bryson, has been right by her side at work — inside the WNBA bubble in Bradenton, Florida — and the time between practices and games has been dedicated to him.
“Right now, I’m making him chicken nuggets as I’m doing this interview,” Hartley, a Phoenix Mercury guard, said with a chuckle, while Bryson could be heard in the background. “Just multitasking.”
Hartley, a seven-year league veteran, was excelling at the “work” part of work-life balance before tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee Friday, which will keep her out for the rest of the season. She was putting up the best numbers of her career in her first season with the Mercury, averaging 15.4 points, 4.8 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 37.5% from 3-point range.
Though Hartley’s season ended early, it was just the first one in her three-year deal with Phoenix, and it has provided much for her to build on. She was an athletic, consistent scoring and playmaking threat for a Mercury team that has been without two star players, guard Diana Taurasi (hip injury) and center Brittney Griner (personal reasons), at points throughout this truncated season.
Before her injury, Hartley talked to The New York Times about her breakout season, what she has learned from Taurasi and how she has continued pushing for social justice from inside the bubble.
This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.
Q: What has allowed you to have so much success on a new team this season?
A: Part of it is kind of coming to a new team with a different role. Coach Sandy Brondello had me come in here definitely to be a scoring threat, and that’s really encouraging. I think other times, it was kind of like teams wanted me to be more of a pass-first point guard. I think that made me a little more tentative, kind of always looking to pass rather than looking to score. She keeps telling me to be aggressive, and that just encourages me. I come off, I’m aggressive looking to score, and then that opens up things for me to create for other people.
Q: At this point in your career, what would you say is the best part of your game?
A: I think it would be tough for a team to decide what they want to take away from me. I can definitely create for myself and get all the way to the rim. I have a midrange game. I’m able to shoot the 3. For me, it was kind of just deciphering when to use each one of those.
I think I’ve done better at my decision-making, and it makes it tougher for teams. Because if they’re going to go under a screen, I’m going to be able to shoot it. If they’re going over, I’m still able to get in the lane, get to the basket or draw help to create for my teammates.
Q: How do you keep that versatility sharp?
A: Some of it, for me, is definitely experience. It’s being in certain situations over and over again. It’s like, all right, you really got to get this down. This keeps happening. You’ve got to work on this pass, getting that player open. I would say, in the past, I wasn’t always great at coming off the ball screens and hitting the post player. So I just really worked on looking off the player and trying to get the pass there, not always telegraphing it — and just using different types of passes, too.
Q: What’s the biggest thing you’ve learned as a teammate of Diana Taurasi?
A: She’s very consistent. Regardless of whether she’s making shots or missing shots, regardless of if she feels tired or not, she’s always there after practice. She does her routine and gets her shots up. I think that’s very admirable, because I feel like there’s times I’m just like: “All right, I’m just tired today. I don’t have it. I won’t shoot as much today.” But she’s always there. She stays consistent in her work. Even getting older, taking care of her body, you see all the time she puts in after all these years.
Q: You mentioned your son being with you on campus. What’s a good story or anecdote about him in the “Wubble”?
A: He kind of blew up on social media. He’ll come to practices. He loves taking pictures. They posted him as the “team intern photographer.” For everyone, sometimes it’s just, like, a breath of fresh air. You just see him, not a care in the world. He’s happy all the time.
I think it brings a good energy to practice on some days, especially when we play games back to back and people are tired. There’s so much other stuff going on in the world that’s on people’s mind, so it’s kind of good to have that little free spirit there running around just to lighten the mood.
Q: You peacefully protested in Minneapolis after George Floyd’s killing. Since then, how have you remained socially active? (Note: This interview was conducted hours before the WNBA paused games on Thursday to protest the police shooting of Jacob Blake.)
A: We can’t get out there and protest or do stuff like that now. But they have calls a lot of the time, just speaking with different people whose family members may have been victims of police brutality. The players association is setting up a lot of those calls.
And then just kind of following the narrative of our league, the different initiatives that we have or the different T-shirts that we wear just to bring awareness to these issues. Continuing to post things on social media. Some of our games are on TV. People are watching. We’re gaining more followers. We’ve got to get that message out there for people to see.
Q: What takeaways from those calls have been particularly powerful?
A: It’s just really crazy to hear their perspectives. Sometimes, for me, hearing the stories, it’s sad because you see all this evidence and this stuff that is public knowledge, and you wonder why certain people aren’t convicted. Even the recent video that comes out [of Jacob Blake], people watch that video and they’re like: “Oh, OK, but why was he walking away? Why was he doing this and that?” People’s initial reaction is to say something like that. And we’re just, like, even people who commit a crime should not be shot or killed, and this continues to happen.
The main thing we say to people is we’ve got to really get out and vote and try to change the system, because those are the people making the rules and making the laws.
