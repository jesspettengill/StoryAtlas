NEW YORK — When demonstrations against racism and brutality in policing filled New York’s streets last summer, the police confronted protesters with tactics so aggressive and at times violent that a remorseful Mayor Bill de Blasio later issued a public apology.
But a year after George Floyd’s murder, police officers around the country say that they have been subjected to taunts and insults during the demonstrations that have left them feeling vilified. Now, one New York City police union is testing an unusual new tactic to hit back at protesters: suing them.
Last week, on the same day de Blasio released new guidelines for how the police would respond to protests, a New York City Police detective, Vincent Cheung, announced that he was suing a protester who was caught on video hurling racist, anti-Asian insults at him during a protest in March.
Police in New York and around the country have occasionally brought lawsuits against people who attack and injure them physically. But a lawsuit from an officer over words used at a protest — even hateful ones — raises thorny questions about free speech, which is often protected even at its most vitriolic.
Lawyers who observe police action closely said that they could not recall a lawsuit of this type — pursuing monetary damages from a protester for language used at a demonstration — and added that even if the suit is wholly unsuccessful, it could still represent a new way for the police to confront protesters. A lawyer representing Cheung said that the police believe that civil court is “the only remedy with which they are left.”
“Many officers have said they wouldn’t hesitate to seek that remedy, not with the expectation of a financial windfall, but hopefully as a deterrent to such uncivilized and dangerous behavior,” said the lawyer, James M. Moschella.
In a video of the confrontation released by the police, the protester, Terrell Harper, was just feet from Cheung’s face as he cursed at him, punctuating his comments with racist stereotypes mocking Cheung, who is Chinese American.
In the moment, Cheung made no move to apprehend Harper, who is Black. The protest, on a chilly March evening in downtown Manhattan, continued. Harper said he returned home to Asbury Park, New Jersey, after the protest, which he said was a weekly demonstration for transgender rights and “in solidarity with end Asian hate.”
Five days later, eight people were killed in a shooting in Atlanta, six of them of Asian descent, accelerating already-growing concerns about anti-Asian hate. A week later, the police released the video of Harper.
At the news conference last week, at the headquarters of his union, the Detectives Endowment Association, Cheung said he had often encountered verbal abuse before, but that he was surprised that during a demonstration for racial justice and equality, Harper had gone on what he called “an anti-Asian beratement for over 15 minutes.”
“That type of hate directed towards myself as an Asian American is just disgusting,” he said.
The lawsuit said that Cheung had suffered severe emotional distress and was permanently and seriously injured by Harper’s conduct, which, it said, had incapacitated him from his usual duties and required him to seek medical attention. It asked that the court compel Harper to pay unspecified monetary damages.
In interviews, Harper, 39, apologized for what he acknowledged were racist comments. He said the video had been taken out of context, and that he typically uses racist remarks as part of a broader explanatory monologue to demonstrate what racism looks and feels like.
“I’ve got to change my method, and I came out and apologized for that,” he said.
He said that he had been organizing demonstrations all year and that the lawsuit, along with targeting him specifically, represented a way for the police to stoke tension between Asian and Black communities in New York.
Megan Watson, a Korean American organizer who has attended several marches with Harper, said that she had worked with him to organize a February march in solidarity with the Asian American community against police brutality.
She agreed that the lawsuit was a way to scapegoat a protest leader and deepen long-standing tensions between the communities.
She compared Harper’s monologues, which she had observed, to comedic roasts, but said that she had not heard him use anti-Asian language before. She had, however, spoken to him about the video, she said.
“He understands how it comes across. He understands that there’s work to do,” she said.
The detective’s lawsuit also said that Harper had spit in his face. Harper emphatically denied that, saying he believed the police would have arrested him had he done so. Asked why he had not arrested or otherwise engaged Harper, Cheung said that it “was not the right moment.”
Moschella argued that Harper’s insults would cause more violence against Asians and Asian Americans in New York.
“There’s a direct connection between hate speech and violence that is being caused to racial and ethnic groups in this city,” he said. “Words matter.”
Eugene O’Donnell, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police officer, predicted more lawsuits like Cheung’s, saying that police have been frustrated by the language protesters lobbed at them, particularly rhetoric that targets officers’ race and gender.
He added that even if a judge were to rule against the detective, the lawsuit demonstrated a “tremendous amount of potential for police unions.”
In recent months, city and state leaders have criticized the Police Department’s response to the protests that followed Floyd's murder. A city report released in December found that the department “badly mishandled” those demonstrations. In January, the department was sued by New York’s attorney general, who has called for a monitor to oversee the police’s handling of protests.
Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, a nonprofit group that works to improve criminal justice practices, said Cheung’s lawsuit spoke to the sense of political isolation that police feel. He said it could represent a novel way of holding demonstrators accountable.
“Under the right circumstances, it might be an appropriate response to unnecessary harassment of a cop,” he said.
Lawyers who study civil liberties said that the suit could well have a chilling effect on speech and protests. Alexander A. Reinert, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, said Harper’s speech had been “reprehensible,” but added that even outrageous, hateful and discriminatory speech is not always actionable.
He pointed to a Supreme Court case from 2011 which found that hateful speech is protected if it involves what the court called “matters of public concern.” But he said that even if Harper were to use that or other defenses in court, or the detective’s lawsuit was otherwise unsuccessful, the suit could have a chilling effect on people’s speech at protests.
Remy Green, a New York-based civil rights lawyer, said that a new state law designed to make frivolous, speech-based suits harder to bring would quite likely apply to the detective’s lawsuit. The law could require Cheung to pay Harper’s legal fees.
The police themselves, in New York and around the country, have long been granted broad protections from lawsuits under a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity. But, at least in New York City, that may soon change. On Sunday, legislation passed by the New York City Council that would make it easier to sue officers became law.
A day later, Cheung’s union posted a video on Twitter of another of its detectives being approached by a 25-year-old man and rapped on the head with a long, white stick. The man was charged by police with assault and criminal possession of a weapon. The union said it was considering whether or not to sue.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
The killing of a 42-year-old Black man in coastal North Carolina by sheriff’s deputies is being scrutinized by state and federal authorities, and Gov. Roy Cooper has called for a special prosecutor to take over the case from a local district attorney.
Last week’s fatal shooting of the man, Andrew Brown Jr., while he was apparently driving away from deputies who were trying to execute drug-related search and arrest warrants, is drawing a lot of attention, coming so soon after the shooting deaths of Adam Toledo, 13, in Chicago and Ma’Khia Bryant, 16, in Columbus, Ohio.
Anger and frustration are mounting as Brown’s family, backed by public officials, seeks the release of the body-camera footage of his final moments, and as the names of the officers involved have not been released.
Here’s what we know about Brown's death:
What happened?
Just before 8:30 a.m. on April 21, deputies with the Pasquotank Sheriff’s Office, dressed in tactical gear, drove down a residential street and arrived at a home in Elizabeth City, video footage shows. Moments later, several shots were fired at Brown. (The video was obtained by WAVY, a Virginia-based television station, through a public-records request.)
A 20-second snippet of a deputy’s body-camera footage was released to Brown’s family and their lawyer, who called it an “execution.” A private autopsy, paid for by his family, showed that he was hit by five bullets and killed by a shot to the head.
The family’s lawyer said Brown was sitting inside his car, hands “firmly on the wheel,” when gunshots were fired. He did not appear to be holding a weapon and was driving away as the police continued shooting.
But the local prosecutor said the footage showed that Brown was trying to escape and that his car struck deputies, who then began shooting.
Have the police explained why they opened fire?
The Pasquotank County sheriff said deputies had been executing an arrest warrant on felony drug charges, but he did not reveal how many deputies were on the scene, how many of them opened fire and how many rounds were fired. The shooting is being investigated by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation.
The local version of a SWAT team, accompanied by deputies from another agency, was executing the arrest warrant when Brown was shot, the authorities said. Only a small share of officer-involved fatalities occur in these raids. But in a country where 4 in 10 adults have guns in their homes, they are the most combustible, and the police often use major shows of force to take these actions.
Brown’s family was told that no drugs or weapons had been retrieved from the property or the car, their lawyer said last week. And their legal team has not yet seen the search warrant that officials say was being executed at the time of the shooting.
Why hasn’t the body-camera footage been released?
In North Carolina, police body-camera videos can be released to the public only with a judge’s approval. Anyone may request the release of a video, although some stakeholders can object to its release or ask for sections to be blurred, said Frayda Bluestein, a professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina.
The sheriff said he wants body-camera video made public, and the county lawyer has filed a petition for the release of the videos. On Tuesday, Cooper, a Democrat, also called for the video’s release. A group of media outlets, including The New York Times, also petitioned for its release. But a judge Wednesday declined to release the footage, agreeing with a prosecutor to delay its public airing for at least 30 days.
Although some body-camera footage is released almost immediately, it’s not unusual for there to be a delay in the release.
What happened to the officers involved?
In an office with 55 full-time deputies, seven have been placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting. The names of those involved are not publicly known. At Wednesday's hearing, a lawyer for the deputies said the killing was justified.
The FBI on Tuesday announced that it was starting a civil rights investigation into the shooting by the agency’s Charlotte field office, which will work with federal prosecutors and the civil rights division of the Justice Department.
What has the reaction been in the community?
Elizabeth City is a historic town of about 18,000 people in the northeast corner of the state. Its mayor and its police chief are Black, as are 50% of its residents. There have been peaceful demonstrations there since the day of the shooting. Residents have been demanding that body-camera footage be released to the public. On Tuesday, though, officials in Elizabeth City and surrounding Pasquotank County established curfews from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
“I feel like we are targeted,” said Councilman Gabriel Adkins, who was wearing a “Black Lives Matter” shirt while speaking at a City Council meeting last week. “I’m afraid as a Black man walking around in this city, driving my car down the road, trying to make sure that I’m driving the speed limit, trying to make sure that I wear my seat belt, trying to make sure that I do everything right, because I don’t want an officer to get behind me.”
What can we expect to happen next?
The state bureau of investigation will continue its inquiry, and the findings of an official government autopsy could be publicly released.
A funeral for Brown will be held Monday in Elizabeth City, with the Rev. Al Sharpton delivering the eulogy.

ELIZABETH CITY, N.C. — For a week now, protesters in Elizabeth City, a small, mostly Black community in eastern North Carolina, have taken to the streets, demanding to see the body camera video of the fatal encounter between county sheriff’s deputies and an African American man. Many had hoped that a court hearing Wednesday would prompt the release of the footage and bring some clarity to the matter.
Instead, Judge Jeff Foster of Pitt County Superior Court delayed the public release of the videos for at least 30 days, citing concerns that their release could compromise the investigation into the April 21 killing of the man, Andrew Brown Jr.
In arguing against their release, R. Andrew Womble, the local district attorney who oversees cases in a seven-county region, told the court that the videos show Brown making contact with deputies with his car as he tried to drive away, moments after they arrived to serve drug-related search and arrest warrants. The Pasquotank County Sheriff’s Office deputies then opened fire on Brown, Womble said.
Womble’s description contradicted the earlier account by a lawyer for Brown’s family, Chantel Cherry-Lassiter, who was allowed to see a 20-second snippet of the footage this week. That footage, she said, shows deputies “run up to his vehicle shooting,” after which Brown “finally decides to try to get away” in a way that did not endanger anyone, as officers continued to shoot at him.
The hearing ensured that a community reeling from confusion and frustration over the shooting would have to endure more of it. Protests were nearly guaranteed to continue Wednesday night, said Keith Rivers, president of the local NAACP chapter. “Oh, we ain’t stopping,” he said.
Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer who is leading a large legal team representing Brown’s relatives, said the family was “deeply disappointed” in the judge’s ruling, which delayed transparency in a case that came on the heels of other police shootings in which video evidence was made quickly available.
He alluded to how smartphone and police body cameras have fueled an evidence-based revolution in the way the country considers long-standing complaints by Black people that they are too often subjected to abuse by the police.
“In this modern civil rights crisis where we see Black people killed by the police everywhere we look, video evidence is the key to discerning the truth and getting well-deserved justice for victims of senseless murders,” Crump said in a statement. “Just look at the murder of George Floyd.”
Under North Carolina law, police body camera videos can be released to the public only after the approval of a judge. This week, separate petitions requesting the release of the footage were filed by the Pasquotank County Sheriff’s Office and lawyers for a group of media outlets, including The New York Times.
Foster denied the release altogether to the media outlets, saying they did not have legal standing to request the video. C. Amanda Martin, one of the lawyers for the news outlets, said that she believed that the judge’s ruling was incorrect, and that an appeal was planned.
But Foster also ruled that authorities must show the footage to Brown’s adult son, Khalil Ferebee, and his immediate family within one degree of kinship, plus one lawyer licensed to practice law in North Carolina. The judge said the family could receive redacted versions of the videos from four body cameras and one dashboard camera within 10 days.
Wayne Kendall, one of the lawyers for the family, said the decision represented “somewhat of a partial victory.”
On Monday, lawyers and family members said they were incensed that they were able to view only 20 seconds of footage that one body camera captured when a SWAT-style team of deputies arrived to serve two drug warrants on Brown, 42, who had a substantial history of drug-related arrests. Seven sheriff’s deputies were placed on administrative leave after the shooting, and a private autopsy of Brown determined that he was shot five times, including in the head.
Wednesday’s hearing took place in Pasquotank County’s courthouse in downtown Elizabeth City, where many streets have been closed to traffic over fears of unrest. The hearing in the heavily guarded courthouse was closed to the public, although members of Brown’s family were allowed to attend. Roughly a dozen of his relatives lined up on the sidewalk, eventually marching through a large crowd of reporters and TV cameras as they made their way inside.
After the hearing, Lillie Brown-Clark, Brown’s aunt, said she had a hard time believing Womble’s assertion that Brown’s car had made contact with deputies. “No,” she said. “Not buying it. Thank you.”
In the courtroom, H.P. Williams, a lawyer for the deputies, said the deputies were “distraught.” He also said the shooting was justified.
Michael Tadych, the other lawyer for the media outlets, argued that the release of the video footage would help people decide which of the conflicting descriptions was accurate.
Womble, who is running for a Superior Court judge position, said it would make the most sense for him to release the videos in 30 days if he decided not to bring charges against the deputies after the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation finished looking into the case. If he did decide to bring charges, he said, he would ask the court to keep the videos from the public until they were introduced at trial.
Releasing the video now, he said, would allow potential jurors to draw conclusions about the case, and hinder a fair trial.
“What I do know is that you cannot swing a skunk in front of a group of people, and then ask them not to smell it,” he said.
On Tuesday, Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, called for the appointment of a special prosecutor who would “help assure the community and Brown’s family that a decision on pursuing criminal charges is conducted without bias.”
In a statement on Wednesday, Sheriff Tommy Wooten II, who has faced calls from the local NAACP to resign, reiterated that he was committed to “transparency” and said he was disappointed that the footage would not be released immediately.
The Rev. William Barber II, the president and senior lecturer at Repairers of the Breach, a nonprofit organization focused on uplifting marginalized communities in America, said Black residents of Pasquotank County have a troubled relationship with the sheriff’s office, and called for an independent review of the department’s practices, particularly on how it polices Black residents. Several counties in the eastern part of the state, which Barber called the “Black Belt,” have never seen a Black sheriff or a Black district attorney, he said.
“If these deputy sheriffs would arm up like they did after this young man, something had to give them the feeling that they would be OK,” he said. “For some reason they felt like they could act with impunity.”

As part of the discussion over racism that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, museums have asserted solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and begun to rethink and recast how they portray history.
Among them is a museum dedicated to the writer Jane Austen in the English village of Chawton, where she lived from 1809 until shortly before her death in 1817 at age 41.
This month, the museum, Jane Austen’s House, touched a nerve when its director said that it would include details about Austen and her family’s ties to the slave trade, including the fact that her father was a trustee of a sugar plantation on the Caribbean island of Antigua.
The museum’s director, Lizzie Dunford, told The Daily Telegraph that updated displays would also explore the broader context of the time in which Austen lived, when her family members would have consumed products of the slave trade such as tea, cotton and sugar.
“The slave trade and the consequences of Regency-era colonialism touched every family of means during the period. Jane Austen’s family were no exception,” Dunford said, adding, “This is just the start of a steady and considered process of historical interrogation.”
The reaction from the British tabloids was swift. The Express called the decision “woke madness,” while The Daily Mail said it was “a revisionist attack” and a “BLM-inspired interrogation” of the author’s love for drinking tea. The museum then issued a statement saying that it “never had any intention to interrogate Austen, her characters or her readers for drinking tea.”
The museum said visitors had increasingly asked about Austen’s connection to the slave trade, which was banned in the British Empire in 1807.
“It is therefore appropriate that we share the information and research that already exists on her connections to slavery and its mention in her novels,” the museum’s statement said.
In a statement to The New York Times on Tuesday, Dunford said the museum’s role was to champion what she called Austen’s timeless genius.
“The suggestion that we would do anything to bring this into disrepute is outrageous,” she said.
The museum’s plans come amid a broader examination of the legacy of the British Empire and its role in the slave trade. Last year, the statue of a 17th-century slave trader was torn down in Bristol, England, and the National Trust, a conservation charity, revealed that a third of the properties it manages had direct links to colonialism or slavery.
Austen’s cottage in Hampshire, about 50 miles southwest of London, is “the most treasured Austen site in the world,” according to the museum’s website. Fans, known as Janeites, can see the rooms where Austen wrote or revised her six novels, including “Sense and Sensibility,” and can walk through her garden.
On a virtual tour of her cottage Saturday — the museum is closed because of coronavirus restrictions until next month — two guides told a group of more than 30 Austen fans about her life, including how she made her ink, her favorite food (toasted cheese), and about the fireplace next to which she read “Pride and Prejudice” out loud for the first time after it was published. The tour guides made no mention of colonialism or the slave trade.
Myretta Robens, founder and president of the Republic of Pemberley, a 500-member Austen fan group, said she did not have a problem with the museum adding context about colonialism. She did not, however, want discussion of race and current events to spill into the group’s conversations about Austen’s novels, and she said she had quashed a few heated debates.
“We don’t want combat,” she said of her fan group. Referring to two of Austen’s most well-known characters, Robens said, “It’s hard to talk about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy and talk about the current environment in the same forum.”
Claudia L. Johnson, a professor at Princeton University who wrote the book “Jane Austen’s Cults and Cultures,” said readers have idealized Austen as far back as the mid-1800s, when society was undergoing rapid change because of industrialization.
“A large part of her readership has always wanted to isolate her from the sort of messy hubbub of history, and to imagine that she lived in this quieter, more civil world,” Johnson said. “There is this deep longing to isolate Austen from all of the storms and stresses of modernity.”
Austen’s novels are about a narrow, upper class of British society and are set in picturesque villages, mostly cut off from the troubles of the outside world.
“Jane Austen is now on a pedestal as an expression of something delightful, comforting, beautiful, clever,” said Paula Marantz Cohen, an English professor and the dean of the honors college at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
Many of her fans, she said, want to relish her stories about a simpler time and place.
Some Austen scholars say passages in her novels “Emma” and “Mansfield Park” suggested that she supported abolitionism, but others say that is unclear. Few of her letters survived. But her favorite authors — Samuel Johnson, Thomas Clarkson and William Cowper — were abolitionists. Still, like almost all English families of any means in the 18th century, her family had ties to the slave trade, according to “Jane Austen: A Life,” a book by Claire Tomalin.
In addressing the topic of slavery, Sherard Cowper Coles, president of the Jane Austen Society, said, “This is England’s story, and as our understanding increases, we should tell it and update it.”
But Cowper Coles, a former diplomat who was Britain’s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2009-10, cautioned: “Expecting people to have consciousness outside of their time is not fair. But equally, in our time, we are aware of slavery, we’re living with its consequences in Minneapolis and many other places.”
Frances Brook, a tour guide in England who has led groups to Austen sites, said that she was in favor of the museum presenting more context about Austen’s time, but that condemning her for wearing cotton and taking sugar in her tea would amount to “woke-ism gone a little too far.” Like the rest of us, Austen did things in her everyday life that conflicted with her broader views about the world, said Brook, who last visited the museum in 2017.
Johnson of Princeton said that the museum’s attempt to add context to Austen’s life would not quell readers’ enthusiasm for her.
“Just because you involve Austen in the messiness of history doesn’t mean you don’t love her,” she said.

Body camera footage was released Tuesday of a 26-year-old man who died in police custody after officers in Alameda County, California, pinned him facedown on the ground for five minutes.
The footage from the Alameda Police Department shows the man, Mario Arenales Gonzalez, becoming unresponsive while in handcuffs and police officers quickly beginning chest compressions.
Gonzalez died April 19, one day before Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted of murdering George Floyd by restraining him for nine minutes and 29 seconds, holding him to the pavement with his knee long after Floyd had become unresponsive.
An initial police report from Alameda, south of Oakland, said that “a physical altercation ensued” when officers tried to detain Gonzalez and that “at that time, the man had a medical emergency.” The report said Gonzalez had died in a hospital later that day.
Julia Sherwin, a lawyer representing Gonzalez’s family, called the explanation “misinformation,” comparing it to the initial police report after Floyd’s death. Gonzalez’s family was also concerned with why the police used force in the first place, Sherwin said.
“His death was completely avoidable and unnecessary,” she said, adding, “Drunk guy in a park doesn’t equal a capital sentence.”
At a news conference Tuesday, Gerardo Gonzalez said his brother had not been posing any threat when he died.
“Alameda police officers murdered my brother,” he said.
Three police officers have been placed on administrative leave, and the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office and the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office are both conducting independent investigations. The city of Alameda has also hired Louise Renne, the former city attorney for San Francisco and a former president of the San Francisco Police Commission, to conduct its own investigation.
In addition to the body camera footage, the city released two audio recordings from people who had called 911 to report a Hispanic man later identified as Mario Gonzalez.
One man says Gonzalez has been loitering for about a half-hour and appears to be breaking store security tags off alcohol bottles. Another man says Gonzalez is talking to himself at a fence near the caller’s backyard. “He seems like he’s tweaking, but he’s not doing anything wrong,” he says. “He’s just scaring my wife.”
In the body camera footage, the first officer at the scene asks on his radio whether a nearby store has reported any recent thefts, describing Gonzalez, who has two Walgreens shopping baskets.
The officer, who identifies himself as Officer McKinley, then continues to speak with Gonzalez, asking whether he knows Alameda and whether he is thinking of hurting himself or others. Gonzalez struggles to maintain the conversation or provide his name.
Another officer arrives about seven minutes after the first officer.
“Here’s the plan,” the first officer says. “I’ve got to identify you, so I know who I’m talking to — make sure you don’t have any warrants or anything like that. You come up with a plan, let me know you’re not going to be drinking in our parks over here. And then we can be on our merry way.”
“Merry-go-round?” Gonzalez replies.
The two officers then ask Gonzalez for identification and tell him to keep his hands out of his pockets before they begin trying to detain him.
“Can you please put your hand behind your back and stop resisting us?” the second officer says after several minutes.
The officers eventually push Gonzalez to the ground facedown and handcuff him. “What are we going to do?” the first officer asks. “Just keep him pinned down?”
“It’s OK, Mario,” the officer later says. “We’re going to take care of you.”
The first officer asks for Gonzalez’s last name and his birthday and tells him to keep talking. He answers in whimpered bursts and later begins grunting. At one point, he seems to say, “Please don’t do it.”
After about 4 1/2 minutes of body camera footage showing Gonzalez pinned to the ground, a third officer is seen on his legs. When one officer asks if they should roll him on his side, another replies, “I don’t want to lose what I got.”
“We have no weight on his chest, nothing,” the second officer observes, pointing to Gonzalez’s back. As the first officer tries to adjust his position, the second says: “No, no, no. No weight, no weight, no weight.”
Seconds later, the officers notice that Gonzalez has become unresponsive. They roll him onto his side and then push him onto his back and begin chest compressions after checking for a pulse.
After emergency medical workers respond, the first officer explains that they administered Narcan, which can reverse overdoses. “He went from combative to nonresponsive almost immediately,” he says.
Several experts testified during Chauvin’s trial that the prone position was dangerous because it could impair breathing and that officers should put people they are detaining onto their sides as quickly as possible.
The three officers put on leave were Eric McKinley, Cameron Leahy and James Fisher, a city spokesperson confirmed Tuesday. When asked Tuesday about the death of Gonzalez, the Police Department pointed to its previous news releases about the encounter.

Full text: Kendrick Carmouche has a chance to become the first Black jockey in 119 years to win the Kentucky Derby. But mostly he would like to win for his "Pops."
Kendrick Carmouche's education began when he was a little boy sitting alongside his father as they drove in the pre-dawn mist through southwest Louisiana. They talked balance, pace and soft hands. They talked horses.
Sylvester Carmouche was a jockey. A good one.
He won nearly 700 races at big-time tracks like the Fairgrounds in New Orleans and Louisiana Downs near Shreveport. As Kendrick was growing up, however, the Carmouches were vagabonds, traveling to bush tracks cut from sugar-cane fields and fronted by honky-tonks with names like The Quarter Pole and Cajun Downs.
Sylvester Carmouche had lost his license to ride at the sanctioned racetracks after pulling an audacious, ill-advised stunt during a fog-shrouded race. But Kendrick Carmouche -- who on Saturday will try to become the first Black jockey in 119 years to win the Kentucky Derby -- never thought of his father as "The Fog Jockey," as many others did. He thought of him as a Ph.D. in horse racing and as the "Pops" who took him everywhere and taught him everything.
He still does. And he says that before he gets a leg up on a colt named Bourbonic for the Derby, he will hug his father and thank him for making him the jockey and the man that he is today.
"Look, I'm 37 years old and I've covered a lot of pavement, put in a lot of hard work and stayed positive through hard times," Kendrick Carmouche said. "I learned all that from my Pops."
Carmouche's presence in the starting gate will be freighted with history. He knows that a Black jockey, Oliver Lewis, won the first Derby in 1875 and that 15 of the first 28 editions of the race were won by Black jockeys, most recently Jimmy Winkfield in 1902.
He is also intensely aware of the nation's ongoing dialogue about race.
Last June, when racing returned to New York, Carmouche helped organize a moment of silence at Belmont Park for those lost to the pandemic. Then he and more than a dozen fellow jockeys each took a knee in solidarity with those protesting the killing of George Floyd.
But for all the potential significance of his Derby ride, Carmouche said he would be thinking mostly of his father. "He poured a lot of lessons and love into me," he said.
Lesson 1 was that shortcuts have consequences. Sylvester Carmouche was riding the bush circuit during much of his son's adolescence because he tried to get one over on racing officials and the betting public.
On Jan 11, 1990, a thick fog settled on Delta Downs in Vinton, La., and Sylvester Carmouche could barely see the nose of his horse, let alone the ones competing alongside him. In the 11th race, Sylvester, aboard Landing Officer, appeared to win easily.
Maybe too easily.
Landing Officer, a 23-to-1 long shot, won by almost 25 lengths and nearly tied the track record for a mile race. Afterward, the track veterinarian noticed that neither horse nor jockey seemed winded or dirty.
Sylvester Carmouche was accused of slipping Landing Officer out of the race near the start, hiding in the fog until the other horses rounded the track and then charging back into the race, ahead of the pack, near the final turn. The Louisiana Racing Commission found him guilty and suspended him for 10 years.
"I did it. I was wrong. I did my time," Sylvester Carmouche, 62, said. "The only good thing that came out of it was the time I got to spend with Kendrick and my family."
Sylvester took Kendrick to school at tracks in Louisiana towns like Carencro and Abbeville, where amid betting coups and zydeco music, and often fueled by Budweiser and boudin sausage, boys had been learning how to ride racehorses for more than a century. Those unsanctioned bush tracks are as much a part of Cajun culture as Sunday Mass and crawfish boils.
Eddie Delahoussaye, Kent Desormeaux and Calvin Borel -- Hall of Famers and Kentucky Derby winners -- are among the scores of Cajun jockeys who developed their craft as 11- or 12-year-olds tied to the saddle in match races for stakes as high as $ 10,000.
Sylvester Carmouche won bushels of races on small-town tracks in his youth, as well as in his exile.
When Kendrick turned 13, his father was confident that he had absorbed his tutorials and the hours of practice on the family's Shetland ponies. So he plopped his son atop a thoroughbred and led him into the starting gate at Acadiana Downs for his first taste of race riding.
"He done good -- finished second in a four-horse race," Sylvester Carmouche said. "He came back with a smile that hasn't left him yet."
When Kendrick turned 16, he got his jockey license and began to ride professionally at Delta Downs. He knew at least one person in the jockey's room -- his father. Sylvester Carmouche's license had been reinstated two years earlier, in 1998.
As proud as he was of his son, Sylvester had one more lesson for him: "I told him to go east. Louisiana was good too me, but there was a big world out there for him to see and to make his own life in."
So five days before turning 17, Kendrick Carmouche moved his tack to the Philadelphia area to take on the Mid-Atlantic circuit. He met the woman he would marry, started a family and became the go-to money rider at Parx Racing.
Back in Louisiana, Sylvester Carmouche gained attention for a more upbeat reason, as the primary pilot of Hallowed Dreams, a mare who won 25 of her 30 starts, including 16 in a row. He retired in 2013 at age 55 with 1,348 victories on sanctioned tracks and more than $ 11 million in purses. He still gallops a few horses near his home in Arnaudville, La.
In 2015, after winning five riding titles at Parx, Kendrick Carmouche decided he was ready for New York, America's premier racing circuit. He introduced himself to trainers by working their horses -- up to a dozen a day -- in the morning and making the most of his racing opportunities in the afternoon.
In New York, Carmouche is all business. On Wednesdays, he says goodbye to his wife, Whitney, his daughter, Olivia, 15, and son, Kendrick, 12, and leaves his home in Newark, Del., for a two-and-a-half-hour drive to a hotel near the track. He returns home on Sunday after his last race.
This focus has helped Carmouche climb the jockey standings each year, earning more mounts and more money. Last fall, he won the riding title at Aqueduct, his first in New York, and he currently is No. 7 in the nation in earnings.
No one else in the New York Racing Association jockey colony looks like him. Nor did any riders in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, or anywhere else he has ridden. Black jockeys were forced out of the sport in the Jim Crow era and now are a rare sight in competition.
Carmouche said his race had never held him back in the sport and pointed to his more than 3,400 career victories and more than $ 118 million in purse earnings as proof.
"I work hard. I'm nice to everyone," he said. "If you treat me the same, I don't care if you are pink or green. I learned that from Pops, too."
Now Carmouche has his first Kentucky Derby mount, which, perhaps fittingly, is a long shot to claim the garland of roses.
Early this month, Bourbonic went off at odds of 72 to 1 in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and trailed the eight other horses for a mile. In the stretch, however, Carmouche smooched at his colt, rubbed its neck and got every ounce of speed to win by a nose.
"All I've ever wanted is opportunity," Carmouche said. "I've earned it everywhere I've ridden. Now I have an opportunity to bring home those roses. I wouldn't count me out."

WASHINGTON — A perk of the presidency is the chance to deliver a speech to Congress, and millions of Americans, soon after taking office.
On Wednesday, President Joe Biden will finally do just that, giving his first address to a joint session of Congress, which had been delayed by his administration’s early push to confront the coronavirus pandemic.
Part victory lap and part sales job, the speech will let Biden mark the nearly 100 days he has spent in the Oval Office by describing his efforts to vaccinate Americans and revive the economy, aides said. But he also plans to seize the moment to pitch a broader agenda, laying out his proposals to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure and expand public benefits.
Because of the pandemic, Biden will deliver his speech to a pared-down, socially distanced group of lawmakers and administration officials — a far cry from the tightly packed House chamber of previous years. But the goal will be similar: Make your pitch to the public with the bully pulpit of the presidency.
Here’s what we expect him to say:
On COVID
Biden’s pledge to deliver vaccination shots to 100 million people in the first 100 days of his presidency was at the center of his campaign. On Wednesday, Biden can say he beat that pledge; more than 200 million shots have been given since he took office.
The president says the country is at war against the virus — and he has not won all the battles. Manufacturing problems, concerns about side effects and millions of people who remain hesitant to take the vaccine threaten to undercut Biden’s hopes that the country can return to some kind of normal life by the Fourth of July.
But in his speech, Biden will focus on the positive, that about 43% of Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and nearly a third are fully vaccinated.
On the American Rescue Plan
The president failed on his promise of a bipartisan effort to begin repairing the economic damage from the pandemic. The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed Congress with no Republican support, using a budgetary maneuver that allowed Democrats to push it through anyway.
But in his speech, Biden will focus less on who voted for the legislation and more on whom it helped, such as the families who got $1,400 checks, the unemployed and small businesses that received grants.
His message: The government acted at a moment of need for Americans, when the worst health crisis in more than 100 years threatened economic disaster.
On the American Jobs and Families Plans
He will also argue that the American Rescue Plan wasn’t enough. In his address, Biden will urge support for a fundamental overhaul of the nation’s priorities, including a $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and at least $1.5 trillion more for such things as child care, prekindergarten, community college and paid family leave.
Together, the president’s spending proposals amount to a major reshaping of the government. Biden will make the case that now is the time to take bold action to confront economic inequality, poverty, job loss, educational insecurity and other challenges.
The president has already detailed his American Jobs Plan, saying he wants to tax corporations to pay for rebuilding or upgrading roads, bridges, water pipes, broadband internet and more.
During his speech, Biden is expected to reveal similar details for his American Families Plan, which would increase taxes on the richest Americans to pay for expansions of programs that benefit the poor and the middle class. Among his proposals will be an increase in the tax on capital gains.
On Foreign Policy
As a candidate, Biden promised to end America’s “forever wars.” In his speech, Biden plans to say he has begun to do just that by announcing his decision to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 2001.
The president will warn that the United States still faces a dangerous world: an emergent China; an increasingly aggressive Russia; the growing cyberattack threat; nuclear ambitions from Iran and North Korea; pockets of instability around the globe.
But he will make clear that he does not intend to confront those challenges the way President Donald Trump did — with bluster and unpredictability. Rather, he will argue for being measured and proportionate, noting his decision to impose sanctions on Russia for election interference and the poisoning of a dissident.
On Other Issues
There has been no shortage of other issues during Biden’s first 100 days, and he will address several of them in his speech.
Two mass shootings in Georgia and Colorado sparked calls for new action on guns, prompting Biden to issue several executive orders. On Wednesday, he will repeat his call for congressional action to tighten background checks.
Unwinding Trump’s immigration policies was among the first things that Biden did when he took office. But a surge of migrant children at the U.S. border with Mexico has caused headaches for his administration and tested the government’s ability to offer what the president calls a more humane immigration policy.
During the speech, the president will renew his call for Congress to pass his proposal for a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system that would provide a pathway to citizenship for about 11 million people living in the United States without legal permission.
The president will also urge the Congress — and the country — to come together around changes to policing practices that have led to the killing of Black men in recent years. He will call for the passage of a federal policing overhaul named after George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis.

As part of the discussion over racism that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, museums have asserted solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and begun to rethink and recast how they portray history.
Among them is a museum dedicated to writer Jane Austen in the English village of Chawton, where she lived from 1809 until her death in 1817 at age 41.
This month, the museum, Jane Austen’s House, touched a nerve when its director said that it would include details about Austen and her family’s ties to the slave trade, including the fact that her father was a trustee of a sugar plantation on the Caribbean island of Antigua.
The museum’s director, Lizzie Dunford, told The Daily Telegraph that updated displays would also explore the broader context of the time in which Austen lived, when her family members would have consumed products of the slave trade such as tea, cotton and sugar.
“The slave trade and the consequences of Regency-era colonialism touched every family of means during the period. Jane Austen’s family were no exception,” Dunford said, adding, “This is just the start of a steady and considered process of historical interrogation.”
The reaction from the British tabloids was swift. The Express called the decision “woke madness,” while The Daily Mail said it was “a revisionist attack” and a “BLM-inspired interrogation” of the author’s love for drinking tea. The museum then issued a statement saying that it “never had any intention to interrogate Austen, her characters or her readers for drinking tea.”
The museum said visitors had increasingly asked about Austen’s connection to the slave trade, which was banned in the British Empire in 1807.
“It is therefore appropriate that we share the information and research that already exists on her connections to slavery and its mention in her novels,” the museum’s statement said.
In a statement to The New York Times on Tuesday, Dunford said the museum’s role was to champion what she called Austen’s timeless genius.
“The suggestion that we would do anything to bring this into disrepute is outrageous,” she said.
The museum’s plans come amid a broader examination of the legacy of the British Empire and its role in the slave trade. Last year, the statue of a 17th-century slave trader was torn down in Bristol, England, and the National Trust, a conservation charity, revealed that a third of the properties it manages had direct links to colonialism or slavery.
Austen’s cottage in Hampshire, about 50 miles southwest of London, is “the most treasured Austen site in the world,” according to the museum’s website. Fans, known as Janeites, can see the rooms where Austen wrote or revised her six novels, including “Sense and Sensibility,” and can walk through her garden.
On a virtual tour of her cottage Saturday — the museum is closed because of coronavirus restrictions until next month — two guides told a group of more than 30 Austen fans about her life, including how she made her ink, her favorite food (toasted cheese), and about the fireplace next to which she read “Pride and Prejudice” out loud for the first time after it was published. The tour guides made no mention of colonialism or the slave trade.
Myretta Robens, founder and president of the Republic of Pemberley, a 500-member Austen fan group, said she did not have a problem with the museum adding context about colonialism. She did not, however, want discussion of race and current events to spill into the group’s conversations about Austen’s novels, and she said she had quashed a few heated debates.
“We don’t want combat,” she said of her fan group. Referring to two of Austen’s most well-known characters, Robens said, “It’s hard to talk about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy and talk about the current environment in the same forum.”
Claudia L. Johnson, a professor at Princeton University who wrote the book “Jane Austen’s Cults and Cultures,” said readers have idealized Austen as far back as the mid-1800s, when society was undergoing rapid change because of industrialization.
“A large part of her readership has always wanted to isolate her from the sort of messy hubbub of history, and to imagine that she lived in this quieter, more civil world,” Johnson said. “There is this deep longing to isolate Austen from all of the storms and stresses of modernity.”
Austen’s novels are about a narrow, upper class of British society and are set in picturesque villages, mostly cut off from the troubles of the outside world.
“Jane Austen is now on a pedestal as an expression of something delightful, comforting, beautiful, clever,” said Paula Marantz Cohen, an English professor and the dean of the honors college at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
Many of her fans, she said, want to relish her stories about a simpler time and place.
Some Austen scholars say passages in her novels “Emma” and “Mansfield Park” suggested that she supported abolitionism, but others say that is unclear. Few of her letters survived. But her favorite authors — Samuel Johnson, Thomas Clarkson and William Cowper — were abolitionists. Still, like almost all English families of any means in the 18th century, her family had ties to the slave trade, according to “Jane Austen: A Life,” a book by Claire Tomalin.
In addressing the topic of slavery, Sherard Cowper Coles, president of the Jane Austen Society, said, “This is England’s story, and as our understanding increases, we should tell it and update it.”
But Cowper Coles, a former diplomat who was Britain’s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2009-10, cautioned: “Expecting people to have consciousness outside of their time is not fair. But equally, in our time, we are aware of slavery, we’re living with its consequences in Minneapolis and many other places.”
Frances Brook, a tour guide in England who has led groups to Austen sites, said that she was in favor of the museum presenting more context about Austen’s time, but that condemning her for wearing cotton and taking sugar in her tea would amount to “woke-ism gone a little too far.” Like the rest of us, Austen did things in her everyday life that conflicted with her broader views about the world, said Brook, who last visited the museum in 2017.
Johnson of Princeton said that the museum’s attempt to add context to Austen’s life would not quell readers’ enthusiasm for her.
“Just because you involve Austen in the messiness of history doesn’t mean you don’t love her,” she said.

NEW YORK — In the way that college football grinds the Southeast to a halt on any given fall Saturday, a private school drama in New York flattens the attentions of the city’s moneyed class for anything else, days on end. In this regard, it has been quite a season. Within a period of roughly 92 hours during the week of April 11, the news coming from the Ivy League training grounds hit observers with the pace of an angry linebacker tearing in from the blindside.
Here now, we were introduced to Andrew Gutmann, author of an enraged letter — sent through the mail and postmarked from New Jersey — to hundreds of families at Brearley, the Upper East Side girls school where his daughter was enrolled and where changes were making him very grumpy. Gutmann, the founder of something called the Institute for Finance Education and Career Advancement, who had once run an apparel wholesaler, was going to pull her out, he explained to many people who surely did not care. Brearley — a school with mandatory Latin, a ninth grade experience full of Shakespeare and Jane Austen — was too busy “gutting” its curriculum and appeasing an “anti-intellectual mob.”
Thanks to Fox News and all the other outlets dedicated to the notion that elite liberal institutions have abandoned any hope of sanity in the name of social revolution, Gutmann soon became a minor celebrity on the right — which might have been the whole point.
There, he was joined by a math teacher named Paul Rossi, who had composed a letter of his own, seemingly to the nation at large, laying out his objections to the way that his employer, Grace Church School in lower Manhattan, was going about the business of changing its culture around race. Rossi’s note lacked the hysterical tone of Gutmann’s. It raised valid concerns about the squelching of free thought. But he also took the dubious step of publicizing part of a secretly taped conversation he had with the school’s headmaster, George Davison, in which he goaded his boss, as if he were a prosecutor grilling a witness, into acknowledging that the new programming demonized white students.
By the end of last week the conversation turned to the Dalton School, where Jim Best, the widely admired headmaster, announced that he was stepping down, amid conflicting agendas around these same issues. Who could blame him? Things were only bound to become more and more unmanageable.
The roots of all this chaos extend, more or less, to late last summer, as parents from Chilmark to Amagansett laid down their tennis gear, poured their Negronis and banged out angry emails to administrators and trustees, apoplectic that a $55,000 annual tuition might not guarantee that their children would receive in-person daily learning. Once the academic year got underway — with far more live classroom instruction than the city’s public schools — there were new dissatisfactions to nurture.
The calls for racial parity in the wake of George Floyd’s murder demanded a response from institutions that market their enlightenment even as they persist in advancing the privileges of largely rich, white populations. Over the summer, Black alumni and parents at some of the country’s most prestigious independent schools took to Instagram to document deeply troubling experiences with prejudice at the hands of teachers, students, families. Many stories came not from the long-ago past but from the annals of recent history. Former Dalton students, for example, relayed anecdotes about white classmates likening Black people to gorillas, about a friend’s mother who asked whether “Black men were really violent.” On and on went the horror and indignity.
Nearly every private school in the country thus spent the summer scrambling to intensify curriculums and training around race and racial sensitivity, often with the help of diversity consultants whose approach can feel dependent on jargon and contrived simplicities. The revolution was coming, but it would be filtered through the ethos of a reeducation camp born on the campus of a business school.
Whether consultants were directly involved or not, it soon became clear that not all parents were on board with the new order. In November, former newscaster Megyn Kelly announced on her podcast that she was pulling her sons out of their “woke” Upper West Side school, which turned out to be Collegiate, serving the intellectually adept since 1628. The breaking point for her was a letter circulating within the community, written by an outside champion of racially progressive education, arguing that “there’s a killer cop sitting in every school where White children learn.” However hyperbolic, it was hard to miss the irony: There are almost certainly no future cops in the classrooms of Collegiate, only future Cabinet members and managing directors at Citibank.
The pushback did not end, however, with those who have had to make on-air apologies for remarks uncritical of blackface. In December, a group of Dalton parents and alumni wrote an anonymous letter to the school community titled “Loving Concern @ Dalton.” They worried about “an obsessive focus on race and identity,” filling their children’s days at school. With remote learning giving parents an opportunity to spy on what their children were getting taught all day, these parents did not like what they were hearing — “a pessimistic and age-inappropriate litany of grievances in EVERY class.”
The new programming seemed designed to divide and provoke guilt, they maintained, forcing white children to feel bad about being white. While guilt might seem like a fraught path to reform, it was also the case that these parents weren’t the best representatives of a viewpoint challenging the emerging orthodoxies. Their letter was seven pages long, and the sentence “To be clear, we abhor racism” did not present itself until paragraph 13. The Brearley dad was an even more appalling spokesman, given his belief that “we have not had systemic racism against Blacks in this country since the civil rights reforms of the 1960s.”
Private schools find themselves now at an existential moment. Over the past few decades, as they have become dominated by wealthier and wealthier families, they have found themselves more and more beholden to the habits of modern corporate culture, which has had a long love affair with consultants and the outsourcing of difficult problems. Right now there are lots of specialists popping up, eager to capitalize on institutional insecurity around diversity initiatives. One of them, Pollyanna, has advised Dalton, Brearley and also Grace Church School.
The problem, though, is that consultants often present a blanket approach that fails to recognize the particulars of an institutional culture; the language deployed from one school (or company) to another is scarcely any different. Everything begins to sound as though it has its origins in Oz — inauthentic and alienating.
Rossi’s letter argued that students and teachers at Grace did not feel free to challenge a new language or ideology. When he did, he was reprimanded for “acting like an independent agent of a set of principles or ideas or beliefs,” he wrote. After the letter became public, Davison, the head of school, put together a committee to bring voices from all sides of the debate together. He asked Rossi to join, but Rossi instead chose to leave the school.
In a conversation I had with Davison last weekend, he was very frank about the imperfect nature of the changes at Grace.
“We were in the process of developing programming faster than they we ever had before,’’ he told me. “Whenever you build something quickly, you don’t always see all the pieces. The ones who are going to help you build it the most quickly are the true believers,” he said. But the truest believers are not always those in the best position to advance change without fear.
“We need to be better at communicating those things. We need to get more opinion.” The truth, he said, was that most people were on board with the new mission. “If we were a school in Oklahoma, we might not have the consensus.”
When I asked a high school senior I know about what was missing in his diversity, equity and inclusion training at his private school, he said that often what was left out was “a basic focus on decency and empathy.” Kids want to know how to talk to their friends openly, he said, and they just don’t want to be jerks.

MINNEAPOLIS — Lisa Christensen stood feet from the blue angel painted on a patch of pavement she had become intimately familiar with over the past month. Under the spittle of rain droplets, she clasped her hands in front of her chest and said a prayer to George Floyd.
“I hope we gave him justice,” she said. “Hope he’s looking down and proud of what the jury did, that we did our best, that we didn’t disappoint him.”
Christensen, 56, was one of the 14 jurors in the Derek Chauvin trial, and over three weeks of testimony, this South Minneapolis intersection was the backdrop for the trauma she had to watch nearly every day — gruesome video footage of Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck.
On Friday, she visited the intersection, known as George Floyd Square, for the first time.
“This makes it really real,” she said, before resting a colorful bouquet of flowers among the many items memorializing Floyd and other people killed by the police.
It was in many ways a bookend to a singular experience, a front-row seat to one of the country’s most consequential police killing cases. Through 45 witnesses and the arguments of the lawyers, she sat anonymously on the 18th floor of a courthouse in downtown Minneapolis, referred to only as Juror 96.
Her experience ended abruptly after closing arguments, when the judge, Peter Cahill, told her and another juror that they were the alternates, who step in when another juror is unable to continue serving for any reason.
None of the 12 jurors who deliberated and decided Chauvin’s fate have chosen to speak out, so Christensen’s description of how she saw the trial is the only insight into how members of the jury perceived the case.
After naming the two alternates, the judge offered to arrange counseling for them if needed and asked for their thoughts on the case. He then sent them home while the remaining 12 jurors were sequestered in a hotel room to deliberate.
Christensen was then free to discuss the case, and Friday she seemed to shed her status as a dispassionate juror, instead leaning into advocacy for Floyd. At the memorial, she stood among signs declaring “Black lives matter” and “Justice for George Floyd.” She carefully circled a sculpture of a fist in the middle of the intersection and reflected on why she believed that the jury did the right thing.
The prosecution’s medical experts convinced her that Chauvin had murdered Floyd by kneeling on him and depriving him of oxygen. So she agreed with the verdict that found Chauvin guilty on all three charges, including second-degree murder.
The expert witnesses the defense called only weakened its case, in her eyes.
When one of them, Barry Brodd, a police expert, suggested that someone could rest comfortably in the prone position, facedown on the pavement, it angered her because it seemed like a ridiculous assertion in this context, she said. Then came the defense’s medical expert, Dr. David Fowler, Maryland’s former chief medical examiner. She did not buy his explanation that a combination of drugs, preexisting medical conditions and even carbon monoxide was to blame for Floyd’s death.
“I just don’t think it was real believable,” Christensen said of the defense’s case. “At that point, I felt like they were just trying to say anything. Kind of like, let’s just throw everything out there and see what sticks to the wall.”
Christensen, who said she entered the trial having seen very little of the video of Floyd’s murder, described an experience that was more taxing than she could have imagined. It was filled with unexpected twists, from the mundane — a minicrisis when the Cheetos ran out in the jury room — to the extraordinary, when the police killed a 20-year-old man six blocks from her home in the suburb of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota.
“It was more emotional and more draining than I thought,” she said of her jury service.
Very little was ordinary about this trial. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, very few people were allowed in the courtroom. And because of the high-profile nature of the case, jurors were anonymous and had to be shuttled into and out of the courthouse as discreetly as possible.
Before court each day, jurors convened at meeting places outside of Minneapolis, depending on where they lived, Christensen said. Her meeting spot was behind a sheriff’s outpost in Brooklyn Park. (The other gathering points were at sheriff’s facilities in Plymouth and Golden Valley and a public works facility in Bloomington, she said.)
The jurors would load into vans with out-of-state license plates that would drive them to the courthouse’s underground parking lot, within an area fortified by temporary fencing.
Christensen, who is white, said that while she felt Chauvin was in the wrong, she did not view the case through the larger prism of racial justice. She believes that there is a problem with racism in the country but said she was not well versed on the nuances of it.
She recently got into a dispute with her roommate, who is Black, when she asked him why Floyd and other people do not just comply with police commands. “Several times they had to say, ‘Get out of the car,’ or, ‘Put your hands on the steering wheel.’ And for whatever reason, he just didn’t do it.” But she said that even if she did not understand Floyd’s resistance, he was treated improperly by the officers.
Her feelings were solidified during the testimony of Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist called by the prosecution.
“He pointed out exactly when Mr. Floyd took his last breath,” she said. “So that was powerful. And then I feel like all the doctors that the prosecutors presented pretty much said the same thing in so many different ways. I feel like they all came to the same conclusion.”
Asked if there was a moment when she doubted the prosecution’s case and thought that maybe Chauvin was not guilty, Christensen was unequivocal: “No.”
If the medical experts were decisive for her regarding Floyd’s cause of death, Christensen said testimony from bystanders helped her to understand how out of line Chauvin was. Sitting close to the witness box, she teared up at times when witnesses cried as they recalled seeing the life slowly pressed out of Floyd. One moment in particular that got to her, Christensen said, was when a girl on the stand fought back tears, but her chin quivered.
“I could feel the guilt," she said. "I could feel their pain.”
And the reaction of the bystanders made the actions of Chauvin and the other officers there seem all the more perplexing, she said.
“How can all these different people stand on the sidewalk and notice there is something wrong in this situation; I mean, even a 9-year-old could tell you something was wrong,” she said. “How come grown officers, that this is your profession, you’ve had multiple hours of being trained, that you guys can’t tell there’s something wrong?”
Ultimately, it felt like Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer, could not offer any good explanation for Chauvin’s actions in the nine minutes, 29 seconds he knelt on Floyd, she said.
And she did not believe that Chauvin could have explained it away, so she said it was probably a good idea that he did not testify on his own behalf.
“I don’t think he comes across as, like, a likable kind of guy,” she said. “And maybe that’s just because we’ve seen the video so many times and that picture. Him sitting in the courtroom, he just gave off a cold vibe.”

Full text: Some candidates in the Democratic primary want to cut $ 1 billion or more from the police budget, while others have more moderate proposals, frustrating activists.
When the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty this week of murdering George Floyd, the Democrats running for mayor of New York City, unsurprisingly, offered a unanimous chorus of support.
The two leading moderates in the race -- Andrew Yang and Eric Adams -- said that justice had been delivered, but that the verdict was only the first step toward real police accountability. Maya Wiley and Scott Stringer, two left-leaning candidates, seized the moment more overtly, appearing with other mayoral hopefuls at a rally at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the site of many of last year's Black Lives Matter protests.
"For once, we got a little bit of what we deserve -- to be seen as people who deserve to breathe," Ms. Wiley said to a crowd, within hours of the verdict.
But the candidates' unanimity disappears when it comes to their approaches to running the New York Police Department, the nation's largest. From the size of the police budget to disciplining rogue officers, the candidates offer starkly different visions.
In the wake of the Floyd case and other recent police killings, several candidates on the left, including Ms. Wiley and Mr. Stringer, have adopted the goals of the "defund the police" movement and want to significantly cut the police budget and divert resources into social services.
Another candidate, Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive who also attended the rally at Barclays, has embraced that movement more fully, calling for slashing the $ 6 billion budget in half and for eventually abolishing the police altogether. She and others argue that having fewer officers would reduce violent encounters with the police.
But Mr. Yang and Mr. Adams, more centrist candidates, strongly oppose reducing the police force and instead are calling for more expeditious decisions on police discipline and for improving accountability.
The debate is happening at a precarious moment for New York City, which is facing a troubling rise in gun violence: Last year was the city's bloodiest in nearly a decade, and the number of shooting victims doubled to more than 1,500.
Shootings typically spike as the weather gets warmer, and the coming months will reveal whether the increase in violence over the last year was an aberration linked to the pandemic or the beginning of a worrisome trend.
If gun violence increases in May and June, in the weeks leading up to the June 22 primary that is likely to decide the city's next mayor, it could have an outsize impact on the race. And it may help moderate candidates like Mr. Yang, a former presidential hopeful, and Mr. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who tied for first when voters were asked in a recent poll which candidate would best handle crime and public safety.
Mr. Adams, a Black former police captain, has positioned himself as a law-and-order candidate, saying that he is far better equipped than his rivals to make the city safer -- a key step in its recovery from the pandemic.
"Public safety is the prerequisite to prosperity in this city," Mr. Adams often repeats on the campaign trail.
Mr. Adams is allied with moderate Black lawmakers who have criticized the defund movement and have argued that their communities do not want officers to disappear. Similarly, Mr. Yang supports some police reform measures but has not embraced the defund movement.
Chivona Renee Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, said she feared that Mr. Yang or Mr. Adams would not bring meaningful changes to the Police Department.
"I want a mayor who will listen," she said, someone who was "not at the mercy of the N.Y.P.D."
Calls for sweeping changes and a push to defund the police last summer led to laws banning chokeholds, limiting legal protections for officers facing lawsuits and opening police disciplinary records to the public. But elected officials did not make substantial cuts to the police budget or limit the types of situations officers respond to.
"We're long past the time where people are going to be satisfied with cosmetic reforms or some attempts that really don't get at the root question around reducing police violence and surveillance, increasing police accountability and transparency, and basically divesting from the N.Y.P.D.'s bloated budget and reinvesting that into our communities," said Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform.
Left-wing activists are already applying a fresh round of pressure on the City Council and Mayor Bill de Blasio to reduce police spending in next year's budget.
The death of Eric Garner in Staten Island in 2014 put a particular focus on holding officers accountable. Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Mr. Garner in a chokehold, was not criminally charged, and it took the city five years to fire him from the Police Department.
Mr. Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, endorsed Raymond J. McGuire, a former Wall Street executive who has more moderate views on policing. Ms. Carr said the next mayor would only be able to tackle police reform if the city's finances were stabilized. Mr. McGuire supports measures like increasing funding for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates accusations of police brutality and misconduct and makes disciplinary recommendations.
The next mayor and his or her police commissioner will have to resolve a host of thorny issues: how to discipline officers; whether the police should respond to calls involving the homeless and mental health issues; and how to address protests over police brutality. To put it more simply, in the post-Floyd era, what is the correct form and function of the police force and its 35,000 officers?
When it comes to firing an officer, Mr. Yang believes the police commissioner should continue to have final say; Mr. Adams argues it should be the mayor; and Mr. Stringer wants it to be the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Ms. Wiley has not given a clear answer.
The left-leaning candidates want to prevent police officers from responding to mental health emergencies and remove them from schools; Mr. Yang and Mr. Adams are reluctant to do so.
While Mr. Stringer, the city comptroller, and Ms. Wiley, a former counsel to Mr. de Blasio and former chair of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, have distanced themselves from the word "defund," they both want to cut the police budget. Ms. Wiley has suggested cutting $ 1 billion per year. Mr. Stringer says he would trim at least $ 1 billion over four years and released a detailed plan to transfer 911 calls for issues involving homelessness and mental health to civilian crisis response teams.
Ms. Morales has called for the most sweeping changes to the criminal justice system: She wants to decriminalize all drug use, eliminate bail and build no new jails. Two other candidates -- Kathryn Garcia, the city's former sanitation commissioner, and Shaun Donovan, the former federal housing secretary -- have more moderate positions that are nuanced enough that activists have created spreadsheets to keep track of where the candidates stand.
Mr. Yang and Mr. Adams have their own proposals, but activists are skeptical. Earlier this month, when Mr. Yang attended a bike vigil for Daunte Wright, a young man killed by the police in Minnesota, an organizer recognized him and grabbed a bullhorn.
"You're pro-cop -- get out of here," she said. "Boo! Shame on you, Andrew Yang."
Mr. Yang said in an interview that he decided to leave after that, and that he had spent more than an hour with the group biking from Barclays Center to Battery Park in Lower Manhattan.
"I wanted to join this event in order to really have a chance to reflect and mourn for Daunte Wright's unnecessary death at the hands of law enforcement," he said.
Mr. Yang said he supported measures like requiring officers to live in the city and appointing a civilian police commissioner who is not steeped in the department's culture. He said officers like Mr. Pantaleo should be fired quickly. But he rejected the idea that he was pro-police or anti-police.
"I think most New Yorkers know that we have to do two things at once -- work with them to bring down the levels of shootings and violent crimes that are on the rise, and we also need to reform the culture," Mr. Yang said.
Protesters were upset that Mr. Yang called for an increase in funding for a police task force in response to anti-Asian attacks. They also have doubts about Mr. Yang because Tusk Strategies, a firm that advises him, has worked with the Police Benevolent Association, the police union, which embraced President Donald J. Trump.
Mr. Adams attended the same vigil for Mr. Wright, and he was peppered with questions over his support of the stop-and-frisk policing strategy. Such stops soared under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and they disproportionately targeted Black and Latino men. Mr. Adams said he believed stop-and-frisk could be a useful tool, but that it was abused under Mr. Bloomberg.
Mr. Adams has offered his own ideas: diversifying the Police Department, where Black officers are underrepresented; disclosing the department's own internal list of officers with records of complaints and giving communities veto power over precinct commanders.
He also argues that he is the only candidate with the credibility to transform the force. Mr. Adams has said that he was beaten by the police as a young man and that inspired him to push for changes when he later joined the Police Department.
In an interview, Mr. Adams said that it took the city too long to fire Mr. Pantaleo and he would move more quickly on disciplinary matters if elected.
"I'm going to have a fair but speedy trial within a two-month period to determine if that officer should remain a police officer," he said. "And if not, we're going to expeditiously remove him from the agency. The goal here is to rebuild trust."
Mr. Adams wants to appoint the city's first female police commissioner, and he has spoken highly of a top official, Chief Juanita Holmes, whom the current police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, lured out of retirement. Mr. Yang is also considering Ms. Holmes or Val Demings, a congresswoman from Florida and a former police chief, according to a person familiar with his thinking.
Mr. de Blasio has praised a new disciplinary matrix that standardizes the range of penalties for offenses like using chokeholds and lying on official paperwork. But while current leaders settled on these rules, the agreement signed by the police commissioner and the chairman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board is not legally binding, allowing the next administration to set its own policies.
Many of the mayoral candidates have called for changing how the city handles mental health emergencies. Since 2014, N.Y.P.D. officers have killed more than 15 people with histories of mental illness. The city is currently conducting a small experiment that sends social workers instead of police out on calls with emergency medical technicians in parts of Harlem.
As the Police Department says it is trying to build trust with the community, one recent decision appeared slightly tone deaf: bringing a robot dog to an arrest at a public housing building. The candidates criticized the use of the device, which costs at least $ 74,000.
Mr. Adams said the money would be better spent "stopping gun violence in communities of color."
"You can't build the trust we need between those communities and police with a robot," he said.

Full text: Years before he won a murder conviction for the death of George Floyd, Mr. Ellison, the Minnesota attorney general, was a young civil rights lawyer taking on police misconduct.
MINNEAPOLIS -- As a young civil rights lawyer almost 20 years ago, Keith Ellison took on a client who accused two Minneapolis police officers of sodomizing him with a toilet plunger.
The case had echoes of an earlier police brutality case in New York, in which four officers were sent to prison in connection with the sexual assault of Abner Louima, who was attacked with a broken broom handle in a precinct bathroom.
The officers in the case involving Mr. Ellison's client, Stephen Porter, were ultimately cleared by an F.B.I. investigation. But Mr. Ellison achieved a very different outcome on Tuesday regarding another Black man's encounter with the police, when Derek Chauvin, the white former officer charged with killing George Floyd, was convicted of two counts of murder as well as manslaughter.
Mr. Ellison, 57, who grew up in Detroit and moved to Minnesota to attend law school, became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006 and a rising star of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. He served in Washington for 12 years before abandoning a safe seat to run for attorney general in Minnesota in 2018, becoming the first Black person elected to statewide office. A little more than a year after taking office as attorney general, he took charge of the Chauvin case.
Mr. Ellison has long been an important voice on criminal justice issues in Minneapolis. More than a decade before he took on the Porter case, he represented the mother of Tycel Nelson, who was fatally shot by a Minneapolis police officer, winning a civil settlement. Mr. Ellison, who once led the Legal Rights Center, which offers defense counsel to indigent defendants, was also at the forefront of the racial justice movement here, and an early proponent of mediation work with street gangs and finding community-based solutions for public safety beyond traditional policing.
In prosecuting the Chauvin case, Mr. Ellison assembled a team of outside lawyers to handle motions and the presentation of evidence and testimony, and the outcome was a rarity in America: Very few prosecutors have ever convicted a police officer of murder for killing on the job.
One key to the prosecution's success, legal experts said, was that over the last several weeks of the trial, the "blue wall of silence" among the police -- which once stood tall when a fellow officer was accused of a crime -- appeared to crumble. One officer after another, including the police chief, took the witness stand to disavow and condemn Mr. Chauvin.
While Mr. Ellison did not speak in court, he was there most days on the prosecution side of the room, wearing a suit and often scrolling through the news feed on his phone. He was deeply involved in just about every aspect of the case, from preparing witnesses to weighing in on jury selection, said Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general during the Obama administration who was part of the prosecution team.
Mr. Katyal said he reached out to offer help to Mr. Ellison a few days after Mr. Floyd was killed last Memorial Day.
He described Mr. Ellison's role in the prosecution as a "gentle steering of the ship" that nevertheless got into the weeds at times, sending back line edits of footnotes in legal briefs Mr. Katyal had written for the case.
Through the long months of trial preparation, Mr. Katyal said, a constant message from Mr. Ellison was that their work was part of the larger arc of America's story of racial injustice. "He viscerally felt the pain of what the community has been through," Mr. Katyal said, referring to Mr. Ellison's earlier days as a civil rights lawyer in Minneapolis working on police misconduct cases.
Once, in the lead-up to the trial, Mr. Ellison invited the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed in 2014 by a New York police officer who was never charged, to join the prosecution team's daily meeting. Her presence, Mr. Katyal said, highlighted how Mr. Ellison saw the Chauvin case as not merely about the death of Mr. Floyd, but also as an effort to achieve a measure of justice for all the Black families who have lost loved ones to police violence but never saw a courtroom.
"It was so spellbinding to listen to her and say you're giving me something my son and me never got, a day in court," Mr. Katyal said.
As a Muslim politician, Mr. Ellison has often fought off charges of anti-Semitism over his support of the Palestinians, and when he ran for attorney general he faced attacks from some who suggested falsely that he favored imposing Shariah law. "He faced a great deal to be where he is," said Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Still, while Mr. Hussein called the Chauvin conviction a landmark, he was reluctant to give Mr. Ellison too much credit because he said the evidence and public awareness of the case, especially from the harrowing bystander video, was so overwhelming that anything less than a conviction would have been a stark failure.
After the verdict in the Chauvin case was read on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Ellison, who in the coming months will prosecute three other officers charged in Mr. Floyd's death who are scheduled to go on trial in August, was measured in his remarks. He said the outcome was simply a starting point that he hoped would lead to a wide-scale reckoning with police abuses against people of color.
"I would not call today's verdict justice, however," Mr. Ellison said. "Because justice implies there is restoration. But it is accountability, which is the first step toward justice."
During a meeting on Tuesday night with his team, Mr. Ellison noted that he had spent some of the day with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and that Mr. Jackson had been with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the day he died in Memphis in 1968. Mr. Katyal said that Mr. Ellison "drew a link" in the meeting between what the prosecutors did over the last year in achieving justice for Mr. Floyd and the work of Dr. King and the civil rights activists of the 1960s.
In his public remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Ellison invoked the Kerner Commission, a group appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 to investigate the causes of uprisings over racial injustice in American cities.
"Here we are in 2021 still addressing the same problem," he said, before reciting the names of other Black people killed by the police, including Eric Garner, Oscar Grant, Philando Castile and Daunte Wright, who was killed by an officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center during the Chauvin trial.
"This has to end," Mr. Ellison continued. "We need true justice. That's not one case. That is a social transformation that says that nobody is beneath the law and no one is above it."

Jesse Jackson, and that Jackson had been with Martin Luther King Jr. on the day he died in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968. Katyal said that Ellison “drew a link” in the meeting between what the prosecutors did over the last year in achieving justice for Floyd and the work of King and the civil rights activists of the 1960s.
In his public remarks Tuesday, Ellison invoked the Kerner Commission, a group appointed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 to investigate the causes of uprisings over racial injustice in U.S. cities.
“Here we are in 2021 still addressing the same problem,” he said, before reciting the names of other Black people killed by the police, including Eric Garner, Oscar Grant, Philando Castile and Daunte Wright, who was killed by an officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center during the Chauvin trial.
“This has to end,” Ellison continued. “We need true justice. That’s not one case. That is a social transformation that says that nobody is beneath the law and no one is above it.”

Minutes after the jury delivered a guilty verdict in the murder trial of the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, President Joe Biden called George Floyd’s family with a pledge: He would do everything in his power to usher an ambitious policing overhaul into law.
“We’re going to stay at it until we get it done,” the president said, referring to Democrats’ ambitious federal intervention in policing named after Floyd that has languished in Congress.
Biden was not alone in his optimism. Lawmakers in both parties expressed fresh hope on Wednesday that the conviction could open a rare window of opportunity to break the stalemate that kept a divided Congress from passing even a single criminal justice bill into law last summer, as millions of protesters marched in the streets demanding action.
“We will not rest until the Senate passes strong legislation to end the systemic bias in law enforcement,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. and the majority leader, said on Wednesday.
But to do so, Democrats and Republicans would have to resolve the same stubborn ideological and political differences that had thwarted that effort. Democrats in Congress have pressed for aggressive action to rein in the excessive use of force and racial discrimination in policing, though they have stopped short of moving to defund police departments, as some of the most progressive lawmakers have advocated.
Republicans have pushed back on such tough measures, saying the federal government should not mandate how the police do their jobs, only offer incentives and training. And they have worked to portray Democrats as anti-law enforcement extremists, a theme that proved a potent line of attack during last year’s campaign.
The most contentious issue in the legislative debate has been whether Congress should curtail the protections known as qualified immunity, as Democrats have proposed, removing a crucial shield that protects officers in civil court cases.
Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif. and the lead author of her party’s bill, said late Tuesday that she was hopeful that the guilty verdict and the swell of relief that followed would soften the hardened political lines.
“I am interested in making a difference, I do not care about making a point,” she said in an interview, signaling flexibility from Democrats. “I can make a point and stand on a high horse, but that doesn’t get me anywhere.”
Bass, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and a smattering of other interested lawmakers have engaged in informal talks about the bill for weeks, trying to find a way to break an impasse that caused both bills to fail last summer. Bass said on Tuesday she would press House and Senate leaders to appoint a bipartisan negotiating committee of lawmakers to formalize the talks and attempt to put together a consensus bill in the coming weeks.
Scott, who wrote a narrower Republican alternative to Bass’ bill that Democrats thwarted in the Senate, separately said that he believed the group was “in a position now to move it forward.” He said he was “cautiously optimistic” that lawmakers could reach an agreement “sooner rather than later.”
Hopes that lawmakers would respond to the national outcry for reform were scuttled last summer after Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-led effort to pass a more modest package of bills led by Scott that would have encouraged state and local police departments to change their practices, including penalizing departments that do not require the use of body cameras and limiting the use of chokeholds. Unlike the Democratic proposal, it would not have altered the qualified immunity doctrine that shields officers from lawsuits or placed new federal restrictions on the use of lethal force.
Democrats derided the Republican bill as an inadequate response to a systemic problem and said they would dismiss any legislation that did not comprehensively address the issue of bias in policing. Republicans, in turn, accused them of walking away from the negotiating table to score political points ahead of the November elections.

Full text: Every major broadcast and cable news network -- and even ESPN -- broke into regular programming on Tuesday for live coverage of the Derek Chauvin verdict.
Every major broadcast and cable news network -- and even ESPN -- broke into regular programming on Tuesday for live coverage of the verdict, ensuring that millions of Americans watched in unison as a Minnesota jury found the former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all charges in the death of George Floyd.
"Justice has been served," the CNN anchor Don Lemon declared on-air shortly after the verdict, speaking alongside footage of people celebrating -- and some crying in relief -- outside the Minneapolis courthouse.
Mr. Lemon continued: "I'm sure people who are watching all over this country, watching all over the world, are on their devices getting messages from people, as I am, saying: 'Thank you, Jesus, thank God. Finally, finally -- justice on all counts."'
That sense of relief was echoed by analysts on several networks, including NBC News, where the political analyst Eugene Robinson told viewers that he had "exhaled for the first time in more than an hour" after learning of the verdict.
"One of my first thoughts was, you know, it shouldn't have been this hard, right?" Mr. Robinson said. "We haven't reached our destination on the racial reckoning that we need to have in this country. But I think this will be seen as a step forward, as opposed to what it potentially could have been seen as, which would have been a giant step back."
On Fox News, the anchor Jeanine Pirro, a former New York State judge, said immediately after the jury found Mr. Chauvin guilty: "Make no mistake, the facts are solid on this verdict. This verdict will be upheld on appeal." She took pains to frame the outcome of the trial as a sign "that the American justice system works."
Fox News covered the news on its usual 5 p.m. talk show, "The Five," where the co-host Juan Williams called the day "very emotional."
"It would have been so upsetting, it would have been a kick in the stomach," he told viewers, "if in this most extreme situation, where everybody can see what happened, if the jury had somehow said, 'Let's split the verdict."'
His co-host Greg Gutfeld offered a more disjointed take, claiming it was a "myth" that the trial had divided the nation and saying he was satisfied with the verdict because it might prevent what he characterized as violent protests.
"I'm glad that he was found guilty on all charges, even if he might not be guilty of all charges," Mr. Gutfeld said.
He was quickly interrupted by Ms. Pirro, who had been muttering in disapproving tones as Mr. Gutfeld was speaking. Ms. Pirro scolded Mr. Gutfeld for his views, saying the verdict was a result of clear facts presented by prosecutors. "That courtroom is a place where the evidence is brought in and it is pristine in the way it's handled," she said.
At 8 p.m., Tucker Carlson opened his highly rated Fox News show by questioning how the jury had reached its verdict and blasting the Black Lives Matter movement.
"So we must stop this current insanity," he said. "It's an attack on civilization. At stake is far more than the future of Derek Chauvin or the memory of George Floyd. At stake is America." He continued: "So before we consider the details of today's verdict, a bigger question. One we should all think about: Can we trust the way this decision was made?"
His first guest, the New York Post columnist Miranda Devine, who described President Trump as "an invincible hero" in an October column, claimed there was an "enormous amount of pressure" on the jury. As she spoke, a caption appeared onscreen: "BLATANT INTIMIDATION DURING DEREK CHAUVIN TRIAL."

House Democrats Defeat GOP Attempt to Censure Maxine Waters

WASHINGTON — Democrats on Tuesday defeated an effort by Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, to censure Rep. Maxine Waters for suggesting that racial-justice protesters should “get more confrontational” if the Derek Chauvin jury did not return a guilty verdict.
In an episode designed by Republicans for maximum political advantage, Democrats stayed united in a 216-210 vote to quash McCarthy’s resolution to formally rebuke Waters, a prominent Black congresswoman who is a frequent target of insults by conservatives. The House vote unfolded hours before the jury found Chauvin, a white former police officer, guilty of murdering George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.
McCarthy said Waters, 82, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, had incited violence when she rallied in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, over the weekend with demonstrators protesting the death of Daunte Wright, a Black man, at the hands of a white now-former police officer.
Asked Saturday what protesters should do if not-guilty verdict was reached in the Chauvin trial, Waters said: “We’ve got to stay on the street, and we’ve got to get more active. We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.”
Waters, a 15-term Californian, later said she had been referring to civil rights-era demonstrations, which used tactics of civil disobedience, and Democratic leaders stood behind her.
But McCarthy — who this year declined to punish Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who had previously endorsed killing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — saw an opening to try to put politically vulnerable Democrats on the spot. He portrayed Waters’ remarks as condoning violence and effectively dared her colleagues to back her by putting the matter to a vote, a perilous proposition given that Democrats’ razor-thin margin of control in the House left almost no room for defections.
Still, Democrats held together. Pelosi, also of California, told reporters Monday that Waters had no reason to apologize for her remarks, and Pelosi could be seen whipping votes on the House floor on Tuesday.
“I love my colleagues and they love me,” Waters said after the vote. “I don’t want to do anything to hurt them or hurt their chances for reelection. I will make sure that they are comfortable with my kind of advocacy so that we can all be sure that we can do the right thing.”
After the measure’s defeat, Republicans lost no time in mounting the political attacks that it had been intended to feed. McCarthy issued a news release saying that Democrats had “decided to stand on the side of violence instead of the law.”
House Republicans’ campaign arm blasted out news releases to the districts of endangered Democrats claiming they had voted “for violence.”
In a tweet Tuesday, McCarthy called Waters’ actions “beneath the dignity of this institution,” adding that her comments “raised the potential for violence, directed lawlessness and may have interfered with a coequal branch of government.”
His resolution cited at length comments made by Judge Peter Cahill, who presided over Chauvin’s case and who said Monday in an unusual aside that Waters’ comments may have given the defense an opening to overturn the trial on appeal. Cahill said he wished “elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law.”
McCarthy’s effort was particularly striking after he declined to take any action against Greene, who has referred to the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6 as a “1776 moment.” Democrats denounced his move as hypocritical because he has also not condemned inflammatory speech used by colleagues in his party around the time of the riot.
“Clean up your mess, Kevin,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 House Democrat, said at a news conference before the Tuesday's vote. “Sit this one out. You’ve got no credibility.”
The attempt to censure Waters resurrected tensions between Democrats and Republicans in the House, where many Democrats are still reluctant to work with those who had cast doubt on the legitimacy of President Joe Biden’s victory or encouraged their supporters to march on the Capitol. In the immediate aftermath of the storming of Congress, some Democrats had clamored to censure or even expel Republican members who used bellicose language in the days leading up to the assault, but those efforts went nowhere.
Some Democrats who were unhappy with Waters’ comments feared that moving ahead with censuring her would unleash an endless tide of retributive measures, a concept that Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, invoked in a speech before the vote.
“If confrontation is subject to sanction, then we’re going to have a lot of people on your side of the aisle who we believe are confrontational every day,” he said, adding that Democrats had not advanced a number of similar resolutions targeting Republicans.
“This makes it harder, however, not to proceed on numerous resolutions on my side of the aisle,” Hoyer said.
The situation was reminiscent of the one that McCarthy faced when Democrats pressured him to punish Greene for her past comments. Democrats moved unilaterally to strip her of her committee seats, citing the Republican leader’s unwillingness to do so — an argument that McCarthy parroted on Monday.
“Speaker Pelosi is ignoring Waters’ behavior,” McCarthy wrote on Twitter on Monday. “That’s why I am introducing a resolution to censure Rep. Waters for these dangerous comments.”
The House rarely moves to censure lawmakers. For example, Steve King, a former Republican congressman from Iowa, was never censured for a litany of racist comments he made while in office, including claiming that nonwhite people had not contributed as much as white people had to civilization and that “mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.”
Charles Rangel, a former Democratic congressman from New York, was the last House lawmaker to be censured, in 2010, for transgressions related to financial corruption.

Prosecutor in Chauvin Trial: ‘This Wasn’t Policing; This Was Murder.’

In his last comments to jurors before they begin deliberating over a verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial, a Minnesota prosecutor Monday argued that Chauvin had acted with cruelty and indifference unbefitting of a police officer and should be convicted of murder in George Floyd’s death.
The prosecutor, Steve Schleicher, tried to walk a fine line in his closing argument as he sought to describe Chauvin as a police officer who had not followed the department’s policies while making it clear that prosecutors were not criticizing policing as a whole.
“Imagining a police officer committing a crime might be the most difficult thing you have to set aside, because that’s just not the way we think about police officers,” Schleicher told the 12 jurors who will decide the verdict. “What the defendant did was not policing. What the defendant did was an assault.”
Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, will also make a closing argument Monday, after which another prosecutor will have an opportunity for a rebuttal. Then the jury will be sequestered and will begin discussing the evidence that they have heard over the past three weeks of the trial. The jurors can deliberate for as long as they want before coming to a decision on the three charges that Chauvin faces: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. They must be unanimous to convict him on any count.
For nearly two hours Monday, Schleicher summarized the prosecution’s evidence and tried to raise doubt about the evidence offered by Chauvin’s lawyer, peppering his arguments with portions of the jury instructions and the law. It was Chauvin’s knee on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes that killed him May 25, Schleicher said, not any heart condition or drug overdose. Schleicher referenced the length of time that Chauvin knelt on Floyd — nine minutes and 29 seconds — 22 times in his closing argument.
“George Floyd struggled, desperate to breathe, to make enough room in his chest to breathe, but the force was too much,” Schleicher said. “He was trapped. He was trapped with the unyielding pavement underneath him, as unyielding as the men who held him down.”
Throughout the closing argument, Chauvin, dressed in a gray suit, blue tie and blue shirt, continued to take notes on a legal pad, as he has done for much of the trial.
Floyd’s death set off a wave of protests against police brutality last summer and led to fresh calls from activists across the country to divert public funds from police departments. But Schleicher tried to distance the prosecution from any broad criticism of the police, instead focusing jurors’ attention on Chauvin alone.
“This is not an anti-police prosecution,” Schleicher said. “It’s a pro-police prosecution.”
The prosecutor also sought to humanize Floyd, showing photographs from his childhood and describing a loving family. And Schleicher also referenced Floyd’s struggles with drug addiction and the accusation that he had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes before the police arrived, saying jurors should remember that Floyd is not the man on trial.
“He didn’t get a trial when he was alive, and he is not on trial here,” Schleicher said.
Throughout the trial, prosecutors have tried to get ahead of arguments from the defense that Floyd had resisted arrest and could have overdosed on the fentanyl and methamphetamine that were found in his system.
Schleicher said that Floyd had, at many times, complied with police officers’ commands, even as one of the officers first approached Floyd’s car with a handgun pointed at his head. The prosecutor said Chauvin had shown “indifference” to Floyd’s life by ignoring his repeated complaints that he could not breathe, as well as demands by bystanders to get off of Floyd and an officer’s question about whether the police should move Floyd to another position.
“He could have listened to bystanders; he could have listened to fellow officers; he could have listened to his own training,” Schleicher said. “He knew better; he just didn’t do better.”
Schleicher emphasized to jurors that they were the only ones who had the power to convict Chauvin and said that they had a duty to do so. As he concluded his argument, he showed a photograph of Floyd one more time for the jurors.
“This case is exactly what you thought when you saw it first, when you saw that video,” Schleicher said. “It is exactly that. You can believe your eyes. It’s exactly what you believed; it’s exactly what you saw with your eyes; it’s exactly what you knew. It’s what you felt in your gut. It’s what you now know in your heart.”
“This wasn’t policing; this was murder,” Schleicher continued. “The defendant is guilty of all three counts. All of them. And there’s no excuse.”

Facebook on Monday said it planned to limit posts that contain misinformation and hate speech related to the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd, to keep them from spilling over into real-world harm.
As closing arguments began in the trial and Minneapolis braced for a verdict, Facebook said it would identify and remove posts on the social network that urged people to bring arms to the city. It also said it would protect members of Floyd’s family from harassment and take down content that praised, celebrated or mocked his death.
“We know this trial has been painful for many people,” Monika Bickert, Facebook’s vice president of content policy, wrote in a blog post. “We want to strike the right balance between allowing people to speak about the trial and what the verdict means, while still doing our part to protect everyone’s safety.”
Facebook, which has long positioned itself as a site for free speech, has become increasingly proactive in policing content that might lead to real-world violence. The Silicon Valley company has been under fire for years over the way it has handled sensitive news events. That includes last year’s presidential election, when online misinformation about voter fraud galvanized supporters of former President Donald Trump. Believing the election to have been stolen from Trump, some supporters stormed the Capitol building Jan. 6.
Leading up to the election, Facebook took steps to fight misinformation, foreign interference and voter suppression. The company displayed warnings on more than 150 million posts with election misinformation, removed more than 120,000 posts for violating its voter interference policies and took down 30 networks that posted false messages about the election.
But critics said Facebook and other social media platforms did not do enough. After the storming of the Capitol, the social network stopped Trump from being able to post on the site. The company’s independent oversight board is now debating whether the former president will be allowed back on Facebook and has said it plans to issue its decision “in the coming weeks,” without giving a definite date.
The death of Floyd, who was Black, led to a wave of Black Lives Matter protests across the nation last year. Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who is white, faces charges of manslaughter, second-degree murder and third-degree murder in Floyd’s death. The trial began in late March. Chauvin did not testify.
Facebook said Monday that it had determined that Minneapolis was, at least temporarily, “a high-risk location.” It said it would remove pages, groups, events and Instagram accounts that violated its violence and incitement policy; take down attacks against Chauvin and Floyd; and label misinformation and graphic content as sensitive.
The company did not have any further comment.
“As the trial comes to a close, we will continue doing our part to help people safely connect and share what they are experiencing,” Bickert said in the blog post.

Asian American Artists, Now Activists, Push Back Against Hate

Early in the pandemic, word started to travel among Asian American artists: Racist attacks were on the rise. Jamie Chan told a fellow artist, Kenneth Tam, about getting kicked out of an Uber pool ride by the driver who noticed her sniffling. Anicka Yi, an artist based in New York, called Christine Y. Kim, a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to talk about being spit at on a Manhattan street; Kim, in turn, recounted being accosted in a Whole Foods parking lot.
Tam decided to start recording these incidents in a Google spreadsheet he named “We Are Not COVID.” It circulated on social media first among arts communities, then to wider audiences. Over the past several months, the document has filled up with reports ranging from microaggressions to outright violence.
“I had assumed that things like this were going to start happening, but not so quickly, and not to people I knew,” Tam said in a phone interview. “It made me realize that I needed to educate myself and perhaps other people about it.”
The rise of racist attacks, some of them horrifyingly lethal, has galvanized Asian American artists around the country. They are leveraging social media to raise awareness, gathering to protest despite the pandemic precautions, making new work, and — perhaps above all — finding new grounds for solidarity with one another and with other affected communities to figure out how to respond to the current climate.
Recent anti-Asian sentiment may have been stoked by former President Donald Trump’s xenophobic response to COVID-19 — which he repeatedly called “the Chinese virus.” But it existed long before him, since the arrival of Chinese workers in the 19th century, and stubbornly persists, even after his departure from office.
The effects of this rhetoric have laid bare the vulnerabilities of a group that comprises 5% of the U.S. population and is breathtakingly diverse in its makeup, marked by extreme disparities in income, language and culture.
The murders in Atlanta, in which a young white man killed workers and others in Asian-owned massage businesses, highlighted additional complexities of gender and race: Of the eight victims, six were Asian American women, mostly of Korean descent.
An exhibition titled “Godzilla vs. the Art World: 1990—2001” that was scheduled to open in May at the Museum of Chinese in America, and a forthcoming anthology edited by curator Howie Chen about the group Godzilla, a loose affiliation of artists and curators, are timely reminders that activism is not new for Asian American art workers. They have been organizing for years to increase representation, improve their visibility and forge alliances with other groups.
Godzilla was founded in 1990 in New York City by Ken Chu, Bing Lee, Margo Machida and others. The group tackled problems associated with being Asian American in an art world that tended to see race only in terms of Black and white. In the wake of the 1991 Whitney Biennial, it wrote to the museum’s director to object to the near-absence of Asian American artists.
The message had its intended effect: The 1993 biennial included work by several artists of Asian descent, including Byron Kim. His “Synecdoche,” a minimalist grid of painted panels, each keyed to the precise skin tone of a friend, a neighbor, or stranger, functioned as an abstract group portrait of his multicultural world.
A recent series of abstract works by Kim signals an important shift: It still focuses on skin — but this time that skin is bruised. Done around the time of the 2016 presidential election, the pigment-dyed canvases are less a celebration of multiculturalism than a subtle commentary on the rise of xenophobic and racist politics in the United States.
Likewise, today’s wave of activism seems less concerned about representation — inclusion of artists in exhibitions or hiring of more Asian American museum staff — than on larger issues like the surveillance of immigrant neighborhoods, income inequality and criminalization of sex work — that put their communities at risk.
This change in approach recently led 19 artists involved in Godzilla to withdraw from the exhibition planned by the Museum of Chinese in America in protest of what they called the museum’s “complicit support” of the construction of a jail in Chinatown. (The museum received a $35 million concession from the city, part of a program to invest funds in neighborhoods affected by the construction of facilities in the aftermath of Rikers Island’s closure.)
“The way to fight this kind of xenophobia and white supremacy is to organize and fight the root causes of structural racism and capitalism,” said artist Betty Yu, a founder of Chinatown Art Brigade (CAB).
With co-founders Tomie Arai and ManSee Kong, and a network of other artists and organizers, CAB has been working over the past five years to oppose the gentrification of New York’s Chinatown neighborhood and the resulting mass displacement.
The loss of affordable housing and the closing of garment factories employing thousands of new immigrants are not unconnected to the art world. More and more art galleries are moving into the area, driving up rents.
That encroachment has driven other activist groups to focus on the art world as an epicenter for talking about anti-Asian hate. Stop DiscriminAsian (SDA), which came into being a year ago when Yi began to connect disparate Asian-centered groups and individuals working around the country, including Kim and Tam. As the group grew, the question of how to leverage their own positions in the art world became central.
“It was one of the compelling things that we thought that we as arts workers could contribute to, just because of the fact that so many art spaces, at least in New York and LA and even the Bay Area, were physically adjacent to Asian communities,” Tam said.
Because of shutdowns, SDA’s work has largely been visible on social media — Instagram above all. The organization has created multilingual graphics and downloadable posters, generated memes, commissioned short videos by artists, co-sponsored a Zoom webinar series titled “Racism is a Public Health Issue,” and disseminated information about resources for Asian Americans facing discrimination and guidance for their allies.
After the uprisings sparked by George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police in Minneapolis in May, SDA called on its followers to act in solidarity with Black protesters.
Its recent open letter against xenophobia and racial violence calls for the decriminalization of sex work and for alternatives to over-policing. It also asks signatories to understand the way that Asian Americans have enabled or participated (sometimes unwittingly) in white supremacy, and work to dismantle it. So far, more than 1,000 artists, curators and art workers have made the pledge.
One of the key strategies for today’s artist-activists is creating visibility: calling attention to the often unseen and unnoted presence of Asian American communities in cities and in the culture — to their labor and contributions, and to the violence aimed at them.
Countering invisibility is at the heart of a short film by Astria Suparak titled “Virtually Asian.” It splices together scenes from science fiction movies in which urban landscapes are filled with stereotypical “Asian” signifiers, but the actual characters are almost exclusively white. She worked on it during the coronavirus lockdown.
“The piece is part of a larger project examining 40 years of sci-fi films,” Suparak said, “and how white filmmakers envision a future that is inflected by Asian culture but devoid of actual Asian people.”
The project emerged, Suparak said, “out of an ongoing erasure and racism and violence, and how both in real life and in mainstream media our varied and unique cultures are carelessly misidentified and jumbled together.”
The newly appointed Public Artist in Residence, Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, began to work with the New York City Commission on Human Rights in August. As soon as she was hired, Phingbodhipakkiya began devising a public art project that she would take to the subways to address the way Asian diasporic communities in the city go largely unnoticed.
“The commissioner and I went for a walk in Prospect Park,” she recalled. “I’m not sure she was looking to brainstorm that morning, but I hit the ground running. I felt like there was no time to waste, and our community couldn’t take being invisible any longer. It was something I approached with extreme urgency.”
The result of the collaboration is a public art series titled “I Still Believe in Our City” installed on bus shelters, subway stations and, in a spectacular fashion, on the side of the Barclays Center. The choice of transportation hubs was deliberate, the artist said, since so many bias attacks have occurred there. Phingbodhipakkiya has also made them freely downloadable on her website.
Featuring a range of Asian Americans with captions like “I did not make you sick,” “We belong here” and “I Am Not Your Scapegoat,” they were recently featured on the cover of Time and have been showing up frequently on protest signs at rallies since the Atlanta shootings.
Events over the past year have inspired some artists to begin to address themes of Asian American identities in their work. Tam, who has long explored questions of masculinity in his video, sculpture, and photography, has turned toward questions of Asian-ness. His solo exhibition “Silent Spikes” — a reference to the immigrant Chinese laborers who built the transcontinental American railroads — is at the Queens Museum until June 23. In it, Tam connects stereotypes about the Asian male body with the image of the cowboy and its role in Westward expansion.
Paul Chan is an artist newly spurred to action. His work, while often overtly political, has never addressed Asian issues head on — until now. (Chan’s now-defunct publishing imprint, Badlands Unlimited, issued my book on art, race and protest in 2018.) As soon as he heard about the mass shootings in Atlanta, he produced a poster that reads “Anti-Asian=Anti-Murican.” The piece is part of his ongoing “New Proverbs” series, which parodies signs used by the Westboro Baptist Church that he characterizes as “arguably one of the pioneering Christian hate speech groups in America.”
“The murders were the boiling point for me,” Chan said. I couldn’t let the moment go by without manifesting my feelings into form.”
As artists begin standing up to anti-Asian hate, there remains the question of how useful the term “Asian American” is, given the range of experiences it’s meant to describe.
“Anicka Yi has said this very clearly: ‘What does it mean to be Asian American in the 21st century?’” said Margaret Liu Clinton, a curator and member of SDA, who talks about the desire to develop pan-Asian conversations among the widest possible swath of art workers.
“What continues to unfold is a shared awareness of how different our experiences are across gender, class, generation, immigration, and I think that’s actually what is exciting about this work right now.”

As Police Reform Laws Sweep Across the U.S., Some Ask: Are They Enough?

In February, Illinois enacted a law that rewrote many of the state’s rules of policing and mandated that officers wear body cameras. In March, New York City moved to make it easier for citizens to sue officers. This month, the Maryland legislature — which decades ago became the first to adopt a Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights — became the first to do away with it.
In recent months, state and city lawmakers across the country have seized on a push for reform prompted by outrage at the killing of George Floyd in May, passing legislation that has stripped the police of some hard-fought protections won over the past half-century.
“Police unions in the United States are pretty much playing defense at the moment,” said Brian Marvel, a San Diego officer and the president of California’s largest law enforcement labor organization. “You have groups of people that are looking for change — and some groups are looking for radical change.”
More than 30 states have passed more than 140 new police oversight and reform laws, according to a New York Times analysis of data from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Amber Widgery, a policy expert at the organization, said many of the laws — restricting the use of force, overhauling disciplinary systems, installing more civilian oversight and requiring transparency around misconduct cases — give states far more influence over policing practices that have typically been left to local jurisdictions.
“We’re seeing the creation of really strong, centralized state guidance that sets a baseline for police accountability, behavior and standards” for all departments, she said.
It’s a remarkable, nationwide and in some places bipartisan movement that flies directly counter to years of deference to the police and their powerful unions. But the laws, and new rules adopted by police departments across the country, are not enough to satisfy demands by Black Lives Matter and other activists who are pushing for wholesale reforms, cultural shifts and cutbacks at law enforcement agencies.
“The focus has been so heavily on what do we do after harm has already been committed — after the police have already engaged in misconduct — and far less focused on how do we stop this from the beginning,” said Paige Fernandez, an advocate at the American Civil Liberties Union.
While Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis officer accused of murdering Floyd, was on trial last week, episodes in Virginia, Minnesota and Illinois — which have all enacted reforms — underscored how the new laws would not always prevent traumatic outcomes.
A police officer in Virginia was seen on video pointing a gun at a Black Army lieutenant and pepper-spraying him during a traffic stop. A veteran officer in Minnesota fatally shot 20-year-old Daunte Wright, a Black man, after pulling him over. And video recordings showed a Chicago officer chasing and fatally firing at 13-year-old Adam Toledo, a Latino, after he appeared to toss aside a gun while obeying commands to raise his hands. The events ignited fresh protests and more questions about why police interventions escalated into deaths of people of color.
“People aren’t necessarily happy with the change they’re seeing, because the same thing keeps happening,” said Stevante Clark, whose brother Stephon was killed by the Sacramento police in 2018.
California enacted a law named after his brother that raised the standard for using lethal force, but Clark sees a need for the federal government to impose national regulations.
House Democrats recently passed a sweeping police bill designed to address racial discrimination and excessive use of force, but it lacks the Republican support needed in the Senate. President Joe Biden has also fallen short on a campaign promise to establish an oversight commission during his first 100 days in office.
Nearly 1,000 people have been shot and killed by police annually in recent years, according to data from The Washington Post, which also shows that officers fatally shot Black and Hispanic people at a much higher rate by population than whites.
Some activists have cheered new laws that could curb police misconduct, mainly in states and cities controlled by Democrats. But they also fear that those changes could be offset in Republican jurisdictions that are proposing to expand police protections or impose harsher penalties for protest-related activities like blocking highways and defacing public property.
Police unions, along with many Republican lawmakers, have resisted some of the reform efforts, arguing that they will imperil public safety. But there have been some signs of bipartisanship.
In Colorado, Republicans joined with Democrats, who control the statehouse, to pass a sweeping bill less than a month after Floyd’s death. The law banned chokeholds, required officers to intervene if they witness excessive force and mandated body cameras statewide within three years, among other provisions. The Colorado legislature became the first to eliminate immunity from civil rights accusations, allowing officers to face claims in state court.
John Cooke, a Republican state senator and former Colorado county sheriff, worked with Democrats to revise their proposals. Officials, he said, realized that “we need to do something and we need to do it now.”
Republican-led states including Iowa and Utah have implemented changes, too, banning or restricting chokeholds, among other measures. But Iowa’s Republican-controlled House recently passed a “Back the Blue” bill that Black lawmakers said could unfairly affect peaceful protesters and amounted to “retaliation” against Democrats.
In Maryland, the Democratic-controlled legislature overrode a veto by the state’s Republican governor to pass a sweeping reform package. Outlining his objections, Gov. Larry Hogan said the laws would be damaging to “police recruitment and retention, posing significant risks to public safety.”
Importantly, the package erases the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights in the state, a landmark achievement for police unions in the 1970s. Decades ago, similar protections spread across the country in union contracts and local laws, but its passage in Maryland gave broad protections to every department at once.
Critics said the policing bill of rights reduced accountability: Officers could wait days before being questioned about an allegation; only fellow officers could conduct interrogations; some complaints could be expunged from an officer’s file after a few years.
“It is fitting that Maryland is the first state to repeal it as they opened this Pandora’s box in the first place,” said Caylin Young, public policy director at the ACLU of Maryland.
Maryland’s new laws contain a range of provisions to rein in policing: a body-camera requirement for officers regularly interacting with the public, prison sentences of up to 10 years for violations of the state’s use-of-force policy, and restrictions on so-called no-knock warrants. (Those warrants drew national attention last year when the police in Louisville, Kentucky, fatally shot Breonna Taylor, an unarmed emergency medical technician, after smashing through her apartment door during a botched drug raid. Louisville banned the warrants last summer, and state lawmakers limited their use this month.)
Another Maryland law, named after Anton Black, requires disclosure of information about police misconduct investigations. The 19-year-old died in 2018 after officers pinned him to the ground following a struggle. (Prosecutors did not pursue charges, but his family has sued in federal court.) La Toya Holley, Black’s sister, said that the new laws would help but that a broader shift in policing was needed.
“That culture — that mentality — has to do a complete 180 if we want to enact change,” she said. “And it has to start in-house with the police departments, the captains, the chiefs and also the boards that are actually certifying these officers.”
Maryland’s new standards follow a decision by the Baltimore state’s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, to stop prosecuting minor crimes like prostitution and drug possession.
“When we criminalize these minor offenses that have nothing to do with public safety, we expose people to needless interaction with law enforcement that, for Black people in this country, can often lead to a death sentence,” Mosby told the Baltimore City Council last week.
Other proposals to reduce police interventions have caught on elsewhere. In February, Berkeley, California, barred officers from pulling over motorists for not wearing a seat belt, misuse of high-beam headlights and expired registrations. The moves were in part based on research showing that Black motorists in the city were about six times more likely to be pulled over than white motorists were, although the police union raised concerns that the reforms created “significant safety consequences for citizens and officers.”
In Virginia, a law went into effect last month limiting the minor traffic violations for which officers should stop vehicles. It also prohibits officers from conducting searches solely based on smelling marijuana.
“As a Black woman who understands there’s been a disproportionate abuse of Black and brown people by police officers, we had to do something to prevent these injuries and killings of people of color,” said L. Louise Lucas, a Democratic state senator from Virginia, who proposed the bill and spoke of her own mistreatment by law enforcement. “This is an age-old story for Black people."
Many of the new rules adopted by states and cities have similarities, focusing on the use of force or accountability after the fact. Two of the country’s largest states, California and New York, have been at the forefront of that push — and some cities have taken more dramatic steps.
Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco, for example, last year cut their police department budgets. Activists have called for reducing police funding and diverting some of that money to mental health initiatives and social services. But those demands have often met with resistance, not only from law enforcement but also from Black residents and officials who fear that crime would surge.
In fact, in Oakland, some of those cuts were reversed after a spike in murders and attacks on Asian Americans.
“I understand the conversation about defunding and re-imagining the police, but these are real people dying,” said Sgt. Barry Donelan, the head of the Oakland police union.
The city has had more than 40 homicides so far this year compared with 13 at the same time last year.
Immediately after Floyd’s death, the Minneapolis City Council voted to disband its police force, only to be overruled by a city charter commission.
Last year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York ordered nearly 500 local jurisdictions, including New York City, to devise plans to “reinvent and modernize” policing in their communities, threatening to withhold funding if they failed to do so.
The governor has spoken of the need to “resolve the tension” between police and communities.
“You don’t have the option of ending the police, and you don’t have the option of continuing with distrust of the police,” he said Wednesday to reporters. “So the relationship has to be repaired.”
DeRay Mckesson, an activist and podcast host who helped found Campaign Zero, an initiative to end police violence, said that he saw progress on state and local legislation, especially around the use of force, but that there was plenty of unfinished business around accountability and how the police operate.
“These issues will have to be things that we work on every year until we finish,” he said.
Mckesson, whose organization tracks legislative activity and works with local leaders on policy, said that unions had maintained their robust lobbying presence but that key lawmakers had become less deferential to them in places like Maryland.
“They were like, ‘We know what’s right and we won’t be swayed by the police just saying it’s going to cause fear,’” he said.
The police remain eager to be heard.
“Most of our members across the country are finding that you have state legislatures that are including law enforcement in on the discussion,” said Patrick Yoes, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents hundreds of thousands of officers. “Then you have those that are pretty much freezing them out and have already made up their mind about the direction they’re going — because they believe that this reform somehow is going to save the day.”
Police advocates point to statistics showing increases in violent crimes as evidence that early reforms are backfiring. Nationally, murder rates increased significantly last year, according to preliminary FBI data released last month, although experts have cited a number of possible factors that could be at work, including the pandemic. Excluding law enforcement from the discussions is leading to bad policy, the advocates say.
“They’ve been largely shut out of this conversation, which I don’t think is a good thing because they have experience and knowledge,” said Rafael A. Mangual, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute. “And I think part of that is just a reflection of the moment that we’re in.”
For Carmen Best, who recently retired as police chief in Seattle, cultural changes in policing will come with clear standards and consequences for misconduct.
“People will think twice because they know there are repercussions,” she said.
To get there, she said, there needs to be frank discussion about why “horrific things” sometimes happen to minorities when they interact with the police, including Adam Toledo, whose killing by a Chicago police officer is under investigation.
“At the end of the day, we all watched a 13-year-old die,” she said. “That’s hard on everybody.”

CHICAGO — Another killing by a police officer. Another emotional mayor trying to soothe the city. Another burst of protests, vows for change, pleas for calm.
To Kristian Armendariz, a resident of the neighborhood where 13-year-old Adam Toledo was fatally shot in an alley in March, Chicago is living through a nightmare on repeat.
“This has been going on for decades,” he said. “This thing is going to keep happening.”
Chicagoans reacted with horror and grief to body-camera video released Thursday that showed the killing of Adam Toledo in the early hours of March 29. In the video, Adam is chased down an alley by a police officer, who orders him to stop and show his hands. An analysis of the video, slowing down events that took place in the space of a second, shows the teenager then appearing to toss a handgun nearby and raise his hands in the air, just before the officer shoots him in the chest.
Adam, a seventh grader from Little Village, a neighborhood on the city’s West Side, was one of the youngest people killed by the police in Illinois in years.
For Chicagoans who are still pained by the shooting death of Laquan McDonald by police in 2014, Adam’s death renews the anguish, particularly in heavily Black and Latino neighborhoods where residents have long said they are unfairly targeted by police. It took city officials more than a year to release police video of the shooting of Laquan, a Black 17-year-old who was shot 16 times by a white police officer along a Chicago street.
Mayor Lori Lightfoot faced television cameras this past week — as her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, did six years ago when Laquan’s killing became a national outrage — and bemoaned the circumstances surrounding Adam’s death.
“Simply put, we failed Adam,” she said.
Lightfoot, who won all of Chicago’s 50 wards when she was elected in 2019, has become a target of sharp criticism in the wake of Adam’s death, just as Emanuel had been in 2015. A former federal prosecutor who campaigned on a platform of anti-corruption, police reform and revitalization of Chicago’s neighborhoods, Lightfoot called for a revised foot-pursuit policy for the department but so far had failed to deliver on one of her most prominent promises: a civilian oversight commission for police.
“She advocated for this when she was a candidate, and community coalitions have been catalyzed by her call for this for years,” said Cara Hendrickson, executive director of BPI, a law and policy center in Chicago. “We’ve not had the breakthrough in transforming policing in Chicago that we need to have. While I think the department has made incremental changes, the Chicago Police Department is failing.”
The Chicago Police Department is the second-largest municipal police force in the United States, with 12,000 sworn officers, and has long been criticized for rarely disciplining officers who are accused of misconduct.
At a large rally in the Logan Square neighborhood Friday evening, protesters called for defunding the police and enacting measures like rent control. At the mention of Lightfoot by one of the speakers, the crowd booed loudly.
“Our goal is to not let people forget and keep being active,” said Maximo Rodriguez, who said he had worked in social justice causes since 1985, when he was a college student in Chicago. “The problem isn’t us, it’s the police. Whenever they’re around, there’s a chance for violence.”
Many people in Chicago are now calling for a swift investigation into Adam’s death.
One inquiry has been underway for weeks, conducted by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, an independent agency that investigates police shootings in Chicago. But that process will take months, said Andrea Kersten, chief of investigative operations for COPA, who noted that the agency was on the scene within an hour of the shooting.
“There is no deadline for completion of an investigation,” said Ephraim Eaddy, a spokesman for the agency. “As it is today, we are really only 18 days in. To say that we have come to a conclusion would be premature.”
The officer who shot Adam, Eric E. Stillman, has been placed on administrative leave. The Invisible Institute, a nonprofit that collects officer complaints and other police data in Chicago, said that Stillman has had four use-of-force reports and three complaints filed against him since 2017, but none resulted in discipline.
Bennett Capers, a law professor and director of the Center on Race, Law and Justice at Fordham University, said that prosecutors were responding more frequently to public demand that police officers be charged with crimes in use-of-force incidents.
The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer who was charged in the death of George Floyd, is underway in Minneapolis. Earlier this week, another Minnesota police officer, Kimberly A. Potter, shot and killed Daunte Wright, 20, during a traffic stop; she was charged with second-degree manslaughter three days later. The officer who shot Laquan McDonald, Jason Van Dyke, was convicted of second-degree murder in 2018, the first police officer to be convicted of murder in an on-duty shooting in Chicago in nearly 50 years.
Charging Stillman would be “difficult but not impossible” for prosecutors, Capers said.
“Obviously the police were saying that the kid had a weapon, and tossed the weapon, and all of this happened in a split second,” he said. “Are we really saying that an officer is entitled to shoot anybody who is holding a gun?”
A lawyer for Stillman has said that the shooting, while tragic, was justified given the nature of the threat. “The police officer was put in this split-second situation where he has to make a decision,” the lawyer, Timothy Grace, said.
Rep. Jesus Garcia of Illinois, who is known to most Chicagoans as Chuy, said that he had spent time in recent days thinking about his own experiences growing up in Little Village, raising a family there and working in violence prevention efforts in the neighborhood, which has been plagued by gang warfare.
“Adam and so many other kids have died because of gun violence and gang violence,” he said. “There’s no justice for Adam, because his life has been taken away. Nothing is going to bring him back. We’re all guilty, in a sense, as a community, as a society, for allowing his situation and not seeing the danger signals that this young man needed help.”
Adam’s family has kept a low profile, asking for privacy and urging protesters to remain peaceful.
“The Toledo family implores everyone who gathers in Adam’s name to remain peaceful, respectful and nonviolent and to continue to work constructively and tirelessly for reform,” the family said in a statement Friday. “The family is forever grateful to the leaders and members of Chicago’s Latino community and the residents of Little Village for their support in this time of grief and mourning.”

Biden’s Choice for Civil Rights Post Has Worked to Defend Voting Rights

Full text: Enlarge this image.
WASHINGTON — When Shelby County in Alabama sued nearly a decade ago to strike down key pieces of the Voting Rights Act, a civil rights lawyer named Kristen Clarke helped to argue that the entire law should be upheld. A district court agreed, reaffirming that local governments with a history of discriminatory voting practices needed federal permission to change their voting laws.
Though the Supreme Court ultimately overturned the lower-court ruling, the case helped establish Clarke as one of the nation’s foremost advocates for voting rights protections. Nominated by President Joe Biden to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, she would if confirmed be likely to play a key role on the issue for the administration, which has made defense of voting rights a priority as states including Georgia work to enact laws that restrict access to the ballot box.
Biden called Georgia’s recently passed legislation “Jim Crow in the 21st century,” and he and Attorney General Merrick Garland have said that the government must preserve the right to vote.
“I will follow their lead in ensuring that the Civil Rights Division, if I am confirmed, is using the tools in its arsenal — the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act, the Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Citizens Voting Act — to ensure that eligible Americans have access to the ballot in our country,” Clarke said Wednesday during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Clarke, 46, who would be the first Senate-confirmed leader of the Civil Rights Division to be a woman of color, testified alongside Todd Kim, a Justice Department veteran and Biden’s choice to run its Environmental and Natural Resources Division. Kim told senators that protecting the nation’s “shared interest in the environment and our natural resources” was a calling.
Several civil rights issues, including the uptick in violence against Asian Americans and high-profile police killings of Black people, have made civil rights enforcement one of Biden’s most visible agenda items.
Garland has asked for a 30-day expedited review to determine how the department can most effectively use its resources to combat hate crimes, and he told civil rights leaders Wednesday that the department would scrutinize whether government agencies, including police departments, engaged in “patterns or practices that deprive individuals of their federal or constitutional rights.”
Garland also called the Civil Rights Division “the tip of the spear of the Justice Department’s effort to ensure justice for all.”
He said that Clarke’s skills and experiences would help the department successfully combat discrimination “in areas from housing to education to employment” and “ensure accountability for law enforcement misconduct.”
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee indicated that they viewed Clarke’s voting rights work as one of her strongest qualifications to restore a division that they argued had been crippled by former President Donald Trump's administration.
“Under Trump, the Civil Rights Division reversed long-standing positions in key voting rights cases, giving its blessing to harmful voter ID laws and voter purges,” Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the committee, said in his opening remarks.
“Ms. Clarke,” he added, “has tirelessly pursued an objective that sadly remains elusive even today — equal justice for all.”
Republicans on the committee accused Clarke of being anti-police, an allegation she denied. Police groups including the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police have backed her confirmation.
Republican senators asked whether Clarke supported defunding the police, a slogan and mission embraced by many on the progressive left to cut police budgets or even abolish police departments altogether. The movement has been rejected by policing groups, Republicans and many moderate Democrats, including Biden and Garland.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, homed in on an op-ed that Clarke wrote last June for Newsweek: “I Prosecuted Police Killings. Defund the Police — but Be Strategic.”
“You just said you don’t support cutting funds from police. I find that astonishing,” Cruz said. “In three paragraphs in your article you begin with the words, ‘We must invest less in police.’”
Clarke insisted that she did not support defunding the police.
“I wrote that op-ed without having the power of the purse string behind me and talked about how we can allocate a limited pool of resources in a more effective way,” she told Cruz. “President Biden is committing more resources to police, and I think that’s a great thing.”
The daughter of Jamaican immigrants who raised her in a Brooklyn housing project, Clarke attended the prestigious Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut through Prep for Prep, a program that helps students from modest backgrounds attend top private schools. She went on to study at Harvard and Columbia Law School.
Clarke said that a class trip to Hartford, Connecticut, to hear arguments in Sheff v. O’Neill, which went on to become a landmark school desegregation case, inspired her to be a civil rights lawyer.
“That moment was a powerful display of the role civil rights lawyers play in our society,” she told the committee. “I was mesmerized and deeply moved as I watched attorneys argue for more just and equitable educational opportunities.”
She rejected a corporate law job to join the Justice Department, working in the Civil Rights Division during the George W. Bush administration. She worked at the voting rights project at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and at the Civil Rights Bureau in the New York attorney general’s office, where she led an initiative to protect the right of Jewish employees to observe the Sabbath and religious holidays.
In 2015, Clarke became the leader of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an organization formed during the civil rights movement.
While Republicans expressed skepticism of Clarke, they directed few questions toward Kim, who has spent much of his career as a government lawyer enforcing the nation’s environmental laws.
The son of Korean immigrants, Kim joined the Justice Department through its Honors Program, as did Clarke. He spent 7 1/2 years in the environmental division before serving as the District of Columbia’s first solicitor general.
While a lawyer in the Justice Department’s environmental division, Kim said, he worked on cases involving the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, Superfund site cleanups and Native American land rights. Biden has said that he will prioritize environmental conservation, and has signed executive orders aimed at strengthening environmental protections.

WASHINGTON — After President Joe Biden abandoned a campaign promise to establish a police oversight commission during his first 100 days in office, administration officials have provided few details about how far he will go to combat racism in policing.
On Tuesday, Biden added little clarity when asked what he could offer on the matter of police overhaul: “A lot,” he answered during a meeting with several members of the Congressional Black Caucus. “And I will tell you guys later.”
The brief response came against the backdrop of another fatal police shooting of a Black man in Minnesota and renewed questions about what civil rights advocates could expect from an administration that promised swift action but so far has been slow to deliver.
As a presidential candidate, Biden had called for a national commission to address policing issues after George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died after being pinned under three police officers in Minneapolis in May. The killing spurred nationwide protests and a sweeping police reform bill that bears his name.
But Susan Rice, the director of the Domestic Policy Council, said Monday that such a commission “would not be the most effective way to deliver on our top priority in this area.”
Instead, the administration has embraced a piece of legislation, named for Floyd, that would combat racial discrimination in policing but, given the slim majority held by Senate Democrats and the amount of Republican opposition, is unlikely to become law.
Passed by House Democrats in March, the bill would address policies that are at the center of the debate over race and policing. It would ban chokeholds and eliminate existing protections under qualified immunity, which shields officials who have been accused of violating others’ constitutional rights. It would also create a national registry to track police officers who have engaged in misconduct.
The decision to focus instead on legislation came as several high-profile cases of police violence against Black men prompted renewed calls for change.
Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for more than 9 minutes, is standing trial for murder. Protests have again erupted in the Minneapolis area after Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was shot in the chest and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop on Sunday.
A third episode, in which video surfaced of a uniformed Black Army lieutenant held at gunpoint and pepper-sprayed during a traffic stop, is under investigation by the attorney general of Virginia.
The violence has caused Democrats in the progressive wing of Biden’s party to revisit calls to defund police departments across the country. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., equated Wright’s killing with “government-funded murder” and described policing in the United States as inherently racist.
Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said that the president, who as a candidate opposed calls to defund the police, did not share Tlaib’s view. Instead, she pointed to a host of early executive orders as evidence that he sees racial equity as a central tenet of his presidency.
“He is a strong supporter of working through legislation that could put in place permanent reforms,” Psaki said Tuesday. “Hopefully that gives some reassurance to the public about his commitment.”
Inimai Chettiar, the federal director for the Justice Action Network, which consulted with the Biden campaign on criminal justice measures, said she hoped that the administration was prepared to negotiate on the legislation rather than put its full backing behind the bill passed by House Democrats.
“We just hope and have been urging them that in that process they take a realistic look on that legislation and what they need to do to amend it to bring it to a point where it can pass,” she said. “We suggest they do something that’s more pared down.”
During his campaign, Biden also pledged to restore the use of consent decrees, a court order negotiated between federal and local officials that the Justice Department for years used to pressure police departments. The Trump administration largely backed away from the practice when Jeff Sessions, President Donald Trump’s first attorney general, curtailed their use before his departure in 2018.
Biden has also tapped a former top civil rights official, Vanita Gupta, as associate attorney general and Kristen Clarke, a former civil rights lawyer, to lead the Justice Department’s civil rights division. Those nominations, some said, signaled that the administration would enact more accountability measures. In its discretionary budget request, the administration also proposed $209 million for the civil rights division.
The president also vowed to bolster the Justice Department office that issues grants to police departments with a requirement that it use funds to ensure diversity within police ranks.
“They have carrots, they have funding they can control to try to encourage certain behaviors in police departments, encourage them to seek to find ways of reforming themselves before they have it do it to them by something like a consent decree,” said Kristy Parker, who spent 15 years in the civil rights division of the Justice Department.
With a set of nascent campaign promises, Biden and his advisers have relied on the continued support of civil rights groups as they urge calm after the shooting of Wright.
On Wednesday, Biden will deliver virtual remarks at a convention held by the National Action Network, a civil rights nonprofit founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton. He is not expected to focus on promoting the policing bill.
“We have so much work to do, from criminal justice and police reform, to addressing health disparities and voting rights,” the president will say, according to a copy of his remarks provided to The New York Times.
Biden, who won the presidency in no small part by vowing to prioritize the concerns of Black voters — “you’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours,” he said during his election victory speech — has amassed goodwill from civil rights leaders. Sharpton said in an interview that he was cautiously hopeful that the president would deliver on his promises.
“There’s nothing equivocating about him,” Sharpton said of Biden, “which is why he’s built up a certain kind of relationship” with the civil rights community, “even though we want to push the envelope a little.”
Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference, said in a statement Tuesday that he supported the administration’s decision to step back from promises of a police commission.
“A national policing commission would have no doubt been interpreted as a delay tactic and undercut the urgency of this issue,” he said. “President Biden is showing the exact type of leadership we need by forgoing a commission and instead putting his backing behind critically important legislation with meaningful actions.”
Still, the political headwinds facing the policing overhaul bill are significant. Recent polling shows that Americans are split on how far reform efforts should go, and public trust in the police remains relatively split along racial lines.
Democrats almost certainly lack the Republican votes needed for the measure to pass the Senate in its current form. They also face opposition in their own ranks on the prospect of eliminating the legislative filibuster, which would lower the threshold for Senate passage from 60 votes to a simple majority.
But Biden’s congressional allies, including Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., have signaled their willingness to work with Senate Republicans, including Tim Scott of South Carolina, whose more modest reform proposal last year was blocked by Democrats.
“I think he’s willing to take the risk,” Sharpton said of Biden.

BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. — A 20-year-old Black man died after a police officer shot him during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb on Sunday, sending hundreds of people into the streets where they clashed with police officers into Monday morning.
The protests in Brooklyn Center came hours before the 11th day of the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged with murdering George Floyd, began in a courtroom less than 10 miles away.
Outside of the Brooklyn Center Police Department on Sunday night, smoke billowed into the air as a line of police officers fired rubber bullets and chemical agents at protesters, some of whom lobbed rocks, bags of garbage and water bottles at the police. Mayor Mike Elliott of Brooklyn Center ordered a curfew until 6 a.m., and the local school superintendent said the district would move to remote learning on Monday “out of an abundance of caution.”
Elliott identified the victim early on Monday as Daunte Wright, 20.
The shooting injected more frustration and anxiety into the Twin Cities region, where Floyd’s death and the destructive protests that followed are fresh on residents’ minds as they await a verdict in the Chauvin trial.
Chief Tim Gannon of the Brooklyn Center Police Department said an officer had shot the man on Sunday afternoon after pulling his car over for a traffic violation and discovering that the driver had a warrant out for his arrest. As the police tried to detain the man, he stepped back into his car, at which point an officer shot him, Gannon said.
The man’s car then traveled for several blocks and struck another vehicle, after which the police and medical workers pronounced him dead. Gannon did not give any information on the officer who fired or say how severe the crash had been, though the passengers in the other car were not injured. The chief said he believed that officers’ body cameras had been turned on during the shooting.
The chief did not say what the warrant had been for, but court records indicate that a judge issued it earlier this month when Wright missed a court appearance. He was facing two misdemeanor charges after Minneapolis police said he had carried a pistol without a permit and had run away from officers last June.
Katie Wright, the woman who said she was Wright’s mother, told reporters that her son had been driving a car that his family had just given him two weeks ago and that he had called her as he was being pulled over.
“He said they pulled him over because he had air fresheners hanging from his rearview mirror,” she said. Wright added that her son had been driving with his girlfriend when he was shot. The police said a woman in the car had been hurt in the crash but that her injuries were not life-threatening.
Elliott said his “heart goes out” to Wright’s family and announced a news conference for 11 a.m. Central time.
“We are going to make sure that everything is done in our power to ensure that justice is done,” he said in a video.
John Harrington, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said the unrest that followed Wright’s death had spread to a mall in Brooklyn Center and that people had broken into about 20 businesses there. By about midnight, most of the protesters had fled from around the police department, once National Guard troops and Minnesota State Patrol officers arrived to back up the police officers who stood around the building with riot gear and batons.
Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that he was praying for Wright’s family “as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.”
Gannon said he had asked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the agency that led the inquiry into Floyd’s death, to investigate the shooting.
The shooting comes after two weeks of testimony in the trial of Chauvin, who is white, that has laid bare the pain that the death of Floyd, a Black man, caused in Minneapolis. Jurors have heard from people who witnessed Floyd’s arrest, medical experts who described his death and police officials — including the Minneapolis police chief — who condemned Chauvin’s actions. And the graphic video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd for more than 9 minutes has been played repeatedly.
Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, cited the shooting in Brooklyn Center in court on Monday morning and asked the judge to sequester jurors to keep them from seeing news of the protests. Nelson noted that one juror lives in Brooklyn Center and argued that jurors might worry about sparking more unrest if they did not convict. The judge denied the request. Closing arguments are expected on Monday, after which the case will be in the jury’s hands.
Many businesses in Minneapolis have kept boards over their windows since shortly after Floyd’s death on May 25, when protests rocked the city for days and scores of businesses were burned. And Black residents in and around Minneapolis remain on edge over policing, said Wynfred Russell, a City Council member in Brooklyn Park, another suburb where some businesses were broken into on Sunday after the shooting.
“You do have a lot of raw nerves here,” he said.
Wright, the victim’s mother, said that when her son had called her during the traffic stop, she had urged him to give his phone to a police officer so she could give the insurance information.
“Then I heard the police officer come to the window and say, ‘Put the phone down and get out of the car,’” she said.
She said her son had dropped the phone or put it down, after which she heard “scuffling” and an officer telling Wright not to run. Then, she said, someone hung up the phone. When she called back, her son’s girlfriend answered and told her that he had been shot.
At an earlier protest and vigil near the scene of Wright’s death, his mother had urged the protesters to be peaceful.
“We want justice for Daunte,” she said. “We don’t want it to be about all this violence.”
But hours later, outside of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, protesters chanted and threw things at police officers, inching closer to the building until they were pushed back when police officers fired projectiles that burst with a loud bang and gas that burned their throats and eyes. The gas reached several apartment buildings across the street where families said they were shaken by the conflict that erupted in their front yards.
“We had to shut the doors because it was all in my house,” Tasha Nethercutt, a woman who lives in one of the apartments, said of the gas fired by the police. She said there were four children in her apartment during the unrest, including a 2-year-old.
Kimberly Lovett, who until recently had been a property manager for the four apartment buildings near the police station, said she had driven to the area to check on her former tenants and to show her frustration with the police.
“There are kids in all of these buildings,” she said, pointing toward apartment balconies, some of which had children’s toys scattered on them. “What we’re fed up with is the police steady killing young Black men.”

Full text: Candidates vied for the backing of the influential teachers' union and other players, and one contender made a journey to Minneapolis.
New York City's mayoral contest is indeed beginning to pick up steam.
A handful of endorsements were issued, and two more influential ones -- from the United Federation of Teachers and the Working Families Party -- may soon follow.
Candidates also fanned out across the city and beyond. Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate, appeared with the city's celebrity-of-the-moment: Huge Ma, the creator of the TurboVax website that makes it easier to schedule a vaccine appointment.
Maya Wiley, the former MSNBC analyst, did a sprightly double Dutch jig on a sunny day in the Bronx. And Raymond J. McGuire, a former Citigroup executive, visited Minneapolis to pray for justice outside the courthouse where the former police officer Derek Chauvin is on trial in the death of George Floyd.
Here's what you need to know about the race:
Blue-collar support vs. a 'change-maker'
Two Democratic members of Congress made mayoral endorsements last week: Tom Suozzi, a moderate who represents parts of Queens and Long Island, and Yvette Clarke from Brooklyn, who has one of the most liberal voting records in Congress.
Mr. Suozzi backed Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president; Ms. Clarke supported Ms. Wiley.
Mr. Suozzi emphasized Mr. Adams's focus on "blue-collar workers" and the fact that Mr. Adams "led while others fled" -- a reference to Mr. Yang, who spent portions of the pandemic at a second home in the Hudson Valley with his family, leaving his apartment in Manhattan.
Ms. Clarke said Ms. Wiley is "the change-maker this moment calls for" and would bring "competence and compassion to City Hall." She said Ms. Wiley was one of the first top-tier mayoral candidates who "embodies the feminine" -- apparently ignoring or discounting past Democratic hopefuls like Ruth Messinger, the first woman to win the party's mayoral nomination, or Christine Quinn and Bella Abzug, who both lost primary elections for the Democratic nomination, as well as a Republican candidate, Nicole Malliotakis, now a member of Congress.
Ms. Clarke later clarified that she did not intend to "diminish or erase" other women running for mayor this year or in past elections.
Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, received an endorsement from the union that represents public school principals. Mr. Yang received support from Matthew W. Daus, the city's former taxi commissioner whose role in the current taxi crisis has been scrutinized.
Mr. Yang also landed an appearance, but not quite an endorsement, from Mr. Ma, sometimes known as "Vax Daddy," at a news conference outside a vaccination site in Washington Heights, and said he wanted to hire him in a Yang administration. Mr. Ma said he was not ready to back a candidate quite yet.
"The only thing I am ready to endorse is more protected bike lanes," he said.
An unorthodox way to seek an endorsement
One of the last major unclaimed endorsements should be decided this month, and the top four candidates -- Mr. Stringer, Ms. Wiley, Mr. Adams and Mr. Yang -- made their cases on Wednesday at a forum hosted by the United Federation of Teachers.
Of the four, Mr. Yang seemed to be the most willing to diverge from union orthodoxy, seemingly hurting his chances for the endorsement.
He was the only candidate to unequivocally say he wanted to retain mayoral control of city schools as is, contrary to union efforts to weaken mayoral control. He was also the only candidate to admit to not reading the union's five-point plan for reopening schools in September.
But Mr. Yang, who has one son in public school and another in private school, said that he no longer entirely blames the union for reopening delays during the pandemic.
He said he now understood that Mayor Bill de Blasio is to blame, too, relating a conversation he had with Michael Mulgrew, the union's president and the forum's moderator.
"You conveyed to me that it's been a failure of leadership on the part of the mayor and that the teachers need a partner who's committed to reopening the schools in a responsible way that protects teachers and makes everyone feel safe and secure," Mr. Yang said. "I agree that the mayor has failed the teachers and public school parents like me."
The comments represented a departure from what he told Politico in March, when he said that "the U.F.T. has been a significant reason why our schools have been slow to open."
They also seemed to offend the current mayor.
"I don't know what Andrew Yang is talking about now," said Bill Neidhardt, a spokesman for the mayor. "Mayor de Blasio was the only big-city mayor to open up schools."
Campaign trail extends to Minneapolis
Mr. McGuire is a moderate on policing. He served on the New York City Police Foundation, a nonprofit that raises money for the Police Department, and has not called for police to be defunded as some of his fellow candidates have.
So his decision to travel last week to Minneapolis, where the officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck for almost 10 minutes is on trial for murder and manslaughter, seemed to convey a political message.
Mr. McGuire was there with Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died after a New York Police Department officer placed him in a chokehold in 2014 on Staten Island; the Rev. Al Sharpton; and a former New York State governor, David Paterson. The group met privately with Mr. Floyd's family.
Mr. Sharpton said that Mr. McGuire called and asked if he could join him in Minneapolis, where he has traveled regularly to support Mr. Floyd's family. He said Mr. Garner's death showed New York is not immune from such tragedies.
"This is not an isolated issue or a question or whether it could happen here; it did happen here," Mr. Sharpton said.
Mr. Sharpton has yet to endorse in the race for mayor, but said that he viewed Mr. McGuire's interest in Mr. Floyd's trial as a good sign. "He was the only one who asked to go, and that speaks for itself," he said.
Candidates for mayor should take note of the Minneapolis police chief's testimony that his officer had violated departmental rules in Mr. Floyd's death, Mr. Sharpton said, adding that the next mayor should dismantle the so-called blue wall of silence.
Mr. McGuire, who said that the "evidence is incontrovertible" that Mr. Floyd's death was a criminal act, said that policing in New York could be "fixed with the right leadership."
"We want better policing," Mr. McGuire said. "You go to the neighborhood, and people aren't talking about defund."
70 plans in 70 days
Shaun Donovan, the former federal housing secretary, is trying to distinguish himself in the crowded field as the policy wonk who has the best proposals to improve the city.
Mr. Donovan will announce his "70 Plans in 70 Days" campaign this week and highlight one idea every day until Primary Day.
"By June 22, I am confident that every New York City voter will know who the most qualified person is to lead our city through this crisis, and who has the actual plans to get the job done," Mr. Donovan said.
His proposals include equity bonds, a government-funded savings account for every child; 15-minute neighborhoods, where every resident has access to a good school, rapid transit and a beautiful park within 15 minutes of their home; and allowing noncitizens to vote in city elections.
Mr. Donovan has a pile of cash to help get the word out: His father, Michael Donovan, has given $ 2 million to a super PAC for his son.
Mr. Donovan has been lagging in the polls, and his campaign took aim at Mr. Yang last week. It joked that Mr. Donovan would not climb atop salt piles when visiting a sanitation facility like Mr. Yang did.
One of Mr. Yang's campaign managers hit back on Twitter: "Will his dad not let him climb on the salt?"
Andrew Yang is writing a book
In February, Mr. Yang made headlines for skipping a forum with Muslim groups on the same day that he spoke on a podcast hosted by Sam Harris, who has made incendiary remarks about Islam.
Less noticed at the time: At the conclusion of Mr. Yang's nearly hourlong appearance on the podcast, he indicated that he was writing a book -- one that apparently deals in part with the new system that will be used in the mayoral election, ranked-choice voting.
He said on the podcast that the book was slated to come out in the late summer.
On Sunday, Mr. Yang's campaign confirmed that Mr. Yang, already an author, indeed does have another book coming, to be published by Random House, and that he finished a draft of the book at the end of last year.
"Andrew is solely focused on the mayoral campaign and will not be publishing this book until afterwards," said Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Mr. Yang. "The book will be about Andrew's experience in the presidential campaign, along with his vision for decreasing polarization, increasing turnout and improving the health of our democracy."
The book, he said, ends before Mr. Yang's run for mayor.

5 Takeaways From the Second Week of the Derek Chauvin Trial

The first week of the Derek Chauvin trial was marked by emotional accounts from bystanders who witnessed the 9 1/2 minutes that the police pinned George Floyd to the ground. But the second week struck a different chord, highlighting testimony from medical and law enforcement experts that centered on the conduct of Chauvin and the cause of Floyd’s death.
Those witnesses hit on the key issues of the trial: what exactly killed Floyd, and whether Chauvin violated police policies on use of force. The answers to those two questions will be crucial for Chauvin, the former police officer charged with murdering Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis last May.
Several medical witnesses testified that Floyd died from a deprivation of oxygen — contradicting claims by the defense lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, who has sought to tie Floyd’s death to complications from drug use and a heart condition. Law enforcement officials, including the chief of the Minneapolis Police Department, said Chauvin violated police policy when he used his knee to keep Floyd pinned to the street.
Here are five key takeaways from the second week of the trial.
— An unusual rebuke of police conduct.
On Monday, Chief Medaria Arradondo of the Minneapolis Police Department said Chauvin “absolutely” violated the department’s policies during the arrest. His statements represented an unusual rebuke of a police officer by an acting chief.
“Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting, and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that, that should have stopped,” Arradondo said. The chief’s statement was one of the most clear-cut and significant on the issue of Chauvin’s use of force, though several other witnesses also suggested that Chauvin acted outside the bounds of normal policing.
Still, Nelson, Chauvin’s lawyer, may have made some headway with other witnesses on the question of force. Officer Nicole Mackenzie, the medical support coordinator for the Minneapolis Police Department, agreed with Nelson’s assertion that a crowd of vocal bystanders could make it difficult for an officer to render medical aid during an arrest. And Lt. Johnny Mercil, a veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department and a use-of-force instructor, also said that hostile bystanders can raise alarm with officers.
Nelson has suggested throughout the trial that the crowd of bystanders outside the Cup Foods convenience store, some of whom yelled at Chauvin during the arrest, may have hindered the former officer from providing help once Floyd became unresponsive.
— ‘Deadly force’ instead of none.
Sgt. Jody Stiger, who works with the Los Angeles Police Department Inspector General’s Office, continued to explore the use-of-force issue by saying that Chauvin used “deadly force” when he should have used none. He also teed up another aspect of the trial that came into focus later in the week: whether Floyd’s death was caused by “asphyxia,” or a lack of oxygen.
“He was in the prone position, he was handcuffed, he was not attempting to resist, he was not attempting to assault the officers — kick, punch or anything of that nature,” Stiger said. Responding to questions from the defense, Stiger said that Floyd resisted arrest when the officers tried to place him in the back of a squad car. In those early moments of the arrest, Chauvin would have been justified if he had decided to use a Taser, Stiger said.
The defense has argued that people who do not appear to be dangerous to officers can quickly pose a threat. The sergeant pushed back on that argument, saying that officers should use force that is necessary for what suspects are doing in the moment, not what they might do later.
— Physical evidence of drug use.
Floyd’s drug use was a recurring point of discussion throughout the week. On Wednesday, the jury heard testimony from McKenzie Anderson, a forensic scientist with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension who processed the squad car that Floyd was briefly placed in on the night he died. An initial inspection found no drugs in the vehicle, but during a second search, requested by Chauvin’s defense team in January, the team discovered fragments of pills. In testing the fragments, Anderson said a lab found DNA that matched Floyd’s.
Breahna Giles, a forensic scientist with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, testified that some of the pills recovered at the scene were found to contain methamphetamine and fentanyl. Chauvin’s defense has suggested that Floyd died from complications of drug use. Later in the week, the medical examiner who performed the official autopsy of Floyd said he found no fragments of pills in Floyd’s stomach contents.
— ‘The moment the life goes out of his body.’
Two medical witnesses on Thursday testified that they saw no evidence that Floyd died from a drug overdose. The first, Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist and critical care physician from the Chicago area, said that any normal person could have died from being pinned under Chauvin’s knee for 9 1/2 minutes.
His testimony gave a moment-by-moment breakdown of the arrest of Floyd, identifying what he believed to be “the moment the life goes out of his body.” Responding to Nelson’s suggestion that Floyd died from complications of fentanyl use — a toxicology report found fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system — Tobin said Floyd’s behavior did not correspond with that of a person who was overdosing.
He also pushed back on the idea that simply because Floyd was speaking, he was getting enough oxygen. Tobin said that a person might be taking in enough oxygen to speak but not enough to survive. The person can be alive and talking one moment, and dead just seconds later, he said. Dr. Bill Smock, the surgeon for the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department, also testified, saying he saw no evidence of an overdose.
“That is not a fentanyl overdose,” Smock said. “That is somebody begging to breathe.”
— Testimony from the medical examiner.
The second week ended with testimony from Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner who performed the official autopsy of George Floyd. Baker testified that while drug use and a heart condition contributed to Floyd’s death, police restraint was the main cause.
Leading up to the trial, Baker had made several statements that could have complicated the arguments of the prosecution, particularly in relation to Floyd’s drug use. During testimony on Friday, he said that the level of fentanyl found in Floyd’s system could have been fatal for some people.
Still, Baker said that, in Floyd’s case, it was less likely than other potential causes of death. He added that Floyd had an enlarged heart for his size, which would require more oxygen to pump blood through his body. High-intensity situations — like the one Floyd experienced during his arrest — could exacerbate that problem.
“In my opinion, the law enforcement, subdural restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions,” he said.

Full text: Dr. Andrew Baker, who performed the official autopsy of George Floyd, said that fentanyl and heart disease had contributed to his death, but that the officers' actions were the main cause.
MINNEAPOLIS -- In a trial where many key figures have spent hours on the stand, the prosecution whipped through one of their most anticipated witnesses, the doctor who performed George Floyd's official autopsy, in a mere 50 minutes on Friday.
The reasons for their haste became clear as the witness, Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner, refrained from placing the sole blame for Mr. Floyd's death on the police as he testified in the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former officer charged with murder.
In his testimony, Dr. Baker said police restraint was the main cause of Mr. Floyd's death, but he also cited drug use and heart disease as contributing factors, saying that Mr. Floyd died "in the context of" the actions taken by three police officers as they pinned Mr. Floyd to the street for more than nine minutes.
"In my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions," he said.
The prosecution's other medical experts have testified that the pressure that officers put on Mr. Floyd's neck and back, not his underlying conditions, caused his death.
In most murder cases, the local medical examiner who performed the autopsy is a star prosecution witness, the most authoritative voice on the victim's cause of death. But in the trial of Mr. Chauvin, prosecutors have regarded Dr. Baker as perhaps their most problematic witness -- and possibly one who could help the defense raise reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors.
Throughout the investigation Dr. Baker has made statements that the prosecutors regarded as minimizing the impact of Mr. Chauvin's use of force. He has said that if Mr. Floyd's body had been found at home, his death could have been attributed to a drug overdose, and that he was unable to say whether Mr. Floyd would have died were it not for his encounter with the police.
Mr. Chauvin's lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, seemed to score some points for the argument that he had been advancing throughout the trial, that Mr. Floyd's poor health, drug use and resistance to arrest led to his death.
During Mr. Nelson's cross-examination, Dr. Baker acknowledged that he saw no physical signs of asphyxiation; that Mr. Floyd had a level of fentanyl in his system that could have been called an overdose in other circumstances; and that his heart condition, combined with the exertion of struggling with the police, played a role in his death.
Mr. Floyd had an enlarged heart for his size, Dr. Baker said. It required more oxygen to continue pumping blood throughout the body, especially during a high-intensity situation like the one Mr. Floyd experienced when being pinned to the asphalt for more than nine minutes. "Those events are going to cause stress hormones to pour out into your body, specifically things like adrenaline," Dr. Baker said. "And what that adrenaline is going to do is it's going to ask your heart to beat faster. It's going to ask your body for more oxygen so that you can get through that altercation."
At other times, Mr. Nelson used his cross-examination to push back on Dr. Baker's findings. Mr. Nelson urged him to elaborate on the fact that he found no bruises on Mr. Floyd's back, and that the level of fentanyl found in Mr. Floyd's system could have been fatal for some people. But throughout the cross-examination, Dr. Baker appeared to be uneasy with Mr. Nelson's line of questioning.
On the issue of bruising, Dr. Baker said that death by asphyxiation -- or the deprivation of oxygen -- does not necessarily cause bruising. On drug use, Dr. Baker said the level of fentanyl found in Mr. Floyd's system could be fatal in other circumstances but that, in Mr. Floyd's case, it was a less likely cause of death than other factors.
The prosecution had the last word with Dr. Baker.
Under questioning from Jerry W. Blackwell, Dr. Baker acknowledged that the "heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use" that he had listed as contributing factors were not "direct causes" of Mr. Floyd's death.
"I would still classify it as a homicide today," he said.
To convict Mr. Chauvin of murder, the jury needs to find that his restraint of Mr. Floyd was a "substantial causal factor" to his death, even if there were other factors.
Dr. Baker's past statements made it clear why the prosecution wanted to sandwich him between other expert witnesses, including a forensic pathologist who helped train Dr. Baker and has performed thousands of autopsies.
The pathologist, Dr. Lindsey C. Thomas, said she agreed with Dr. Baker's finding that the cause of death was "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement's subdual, restraint, and neck compression." But she added that bystander video clearly showed that Mr. Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen.
Dr. Baker's phrasing caused some confusion in the months after it was issued, and Dr. Thomas agreed with a defense suggestion that "complicating" could mean different things to different experts. But Dr. Thomas said that in this case, she found it to mean that Mr. Floyd's heart had stopped because of the police officers' actions.
"Mr. Floyd was in a position, because of the subdual, restraint and compression, where he was unable to get enough oxygen in to maintain his body functions," Dr. Thomas testified.
Crucially, Dr. Thomas said she believed that Mr. Floyd would have lived if Mr. Chauvin had not pinned him with his knees -- a direct rebuttal of past statements attributed to Dr. Baker that he could not say if that would have been the case. "There's no evidence to suggest he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement," she said.
During the testimony of Dr. Thomas and Dr. Baker, jurors were shown autopsy photos of Mr. Floyd, although they were not seen by the public -- presumably because Judge Peter A. Cahill thought they were too gruesome to be shown on television.
Dr. Baker said he did not watch the widely circulated video of Mr. Floyd struggling with police officers until after he performed his autopsy, saying he did not want it to bias his findings.
The state tried to diminish the importance of Dr. Baker's autopsy findings as only a starting point in determining the ultimate cause of death. Dr. Thomas explained that Dr. Baker's findings did not preclude asphyxia as a manner of death, since the signs of asphyxia are often undetectable in autopsies.
Mr. Nelson asked her and other witnesses if Mr. Floyd could have died from an overdose or a health condition if the police officers' use of force were stripped away.
That earned a rebuke from Mr. Blackwell, who then said to Dr. Thomas -- before being cut off by the judge after an objection from Mr. Nelson -- that such questioning would be like asking Mrs. Lincoln if her husband would have died if it were not for John Wilkes Booth.

WASHINGTON — One young soldier said that for the first four months after he joined his Army unit, a flag representing the right-wing militia the Three Percenters hung in the entry hall of his barracks.
A Black Marine described feeling sick when he saw the iconic red-and-gold flag of his military service being waved by rioters during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.
A white brigadier general fretted privately about whether service members could get in trouble for supporting former President Donald Trump. A Black Army sergeant described having no one to talk to in his office after the death of George Floyd in police custody.
The Pentagon last week concluded its 60-day “stand down” to address extremism in the military. With a handful of exceptions, every unit in the armed forces has now had some sort of discussion about why white supremacy and extremism — laid bare by the number of veterans who took part in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot — have no place in the U.S. military.
But as the Pentagon on Friday presented its path forward — a working group will be set up to examine how to better vet recruits and how to better educate service members who may be targeted by extremist organizations — senior Defense Department officials acknowledged that one thing is clear: Rooting out extremist views from a military of 1.3 million active-duty troops drawn from Alaska to Florida will be an uphill slog.
“The vast majority of those who serve in uniform and their civilian colleagues do so with great honor and integrity, but any extremist behavior in the force can have an outsized impact,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a memo Friday.
The Pentagon is directing all of the military services to ask recruits a standardized set of questions about extremism in its screening questionnaires to help weed out those who might take part in extremist organizations. But that, by itself, will be difficult to enforce — because the Pentagon does not specifically ban membership in many of those groups.
Austin’s memo says that the updated screening questionnaires will nonetheless better enable officials to “clarify that any demonstrably false answers provided in response could form the basis for punitive action for fraudulent enlistment.” A Defense Department official said the Pentagon was still trying to figure out how to avoid running afoul of the First Amendment protections of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
The phrase “stand down” is used in the military to refer to any issue that the defense secretary decides is important enough that it needs to be addressed through discussions across the force. In the past, “stand downs” have been employed to address topics as varied as safety concerns, sexual assault and suicide.
The latest “stand down” was ordered up by the first Black defense secretary, to remind the country’s military personnel that the oath they took to support and defend the Constitution means that they cannot storm the Capitol to stop lawmakers from certifying election results they do not like.
The “stand down” sessions, said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, demonstrated that “the force wants better guidance about what extremist activity really is,” calling it “a hunger for more information and context.”
Kirby said the department would also work on how to better prepare service members leaving the military to reenter civilian life.
“In some cases, when you retire, they tell you how to pick out a suit and a tie,” he said during a news conference. “But there’s nothing in there, not consistently anyway, about this particular problem.” He said that extremist groups were “seeking the kinds of skills, the kinds of leadership that our men and women exude.”
Defense Department officials and enlisted service members interviewed for this article said that the sessions led to some painful conversations. But the process was sometimes characterized by a scripted, forced delivery from some commanders and senior leaders who seemed uncomfortable with their task.
The Marine Corps released a video last month featuring top leaders that some Black Marines, in private chats, characterized as seeming forced. In the video, Gen. David Berger, the Marine commandant, and Sgt. Maj. Troy Black, the senior enlisted leader, both white men, urged Marines to pay attention to the “stand down.” Their awkward presentation prompted Task and Purpose, an online news site focused on the military and veterans, to publish an article with the headline, “Top Marine Leaders Look Like They’ve Been Taken Hostage in This New Video.”
In other messages to the force, some senior leaders struggled to balance standard rally-the-troops talk with the realities laid bare by the Capitol riot’s exposure of extremism in the military.
Gen. James McConville, the Army chief of staff, sought to bridge that divide. “Well, the message from the senior leaders is we have the world’s greatest Army,” he said during the service’s “stand down” session with senior leaders. “The way we maintain that is preventing behaviors that hurt our soldiers and break trust with the American people. Behaviors like extremism, racism, sexual harassment and sexual assault — they hurt our soldiers and they break trust with the American people, so we cannot have them in our Army.”
In fact, as Pentagon leaders are quick to say, the military cannot be a reflection of the United States without hosting the same kinds of people and allegiances that are embedded in the population as a whole. But while the military is one of the country’s most diverse institutions — some 43% of those on active duty are people of color — Defense Department officials acknowledge that the views of its white service members skew conservative.
On U.S. bases around the world, televisions are often tuned to Fox News. This was particularly so during the Trump administration; since President Joe Biden was inaugurated, CNN and MSNBC have started showing up more.
Officials with the Biden administration have expressed concerns about certain broadcasts targeting troops. On March 2, Kirby ordered a review of programming on the American Forces Network, which caters to service members and families abroad.
While the military can limit what kinds of programs are broadcast in public areas on bases, the Pentagon could run into First Amendment issues as it tries to vet recruits and even active-duty troops.
On Jan. 29, Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., sent a letter to Biden, Austin and Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, asking them to update the military’s background investigation process. She said that it should incorporate a review of service member’s social media profiles to identify ties to white supremacists or violent extremists, as well as establish procedures to review the social media activity of recruits before they join the armed forces.
Experts note that asking someone if they are an extremist is hardly the solution. Deborah Carrington, a former federal investigator with the Defense Security Service and the Office of Personnel Management, said asking people “questions about being part of a terrorist organization or being involved in terrorist activities” was rarely productive.
“They won’t admit to it,” she said. “The only way to find out is to interview someone who was involved in those activities with him.”

A veteran lung doctor testified Thursday that George Floyd’s death was caused in part by Derek Chauvin’s knees pressing against his neck and back, making it impossible for him to breathe, and that Floyd showed signs of a brain injury about four minutes before Chauvin lifted his knee from his neck.
Dr. Martin J. Tobin, a pulmonologist and critical care doctor in Chicago, said in court that the combination of Chauvin’s pressure, the handcuffs pulling Floyd’s hands behind his back and Floyd’s body being pressed against the street had caused him to die “from a low level of oxygen.”
The testimony from Tobin on the ninth day of the trial of Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who has been charged in Floyd’s death, signaled a shift into a new phase in which medical testimony will be crucial. Chauvin’s lawyer has suggested that Floyd died from the fentanyl and methamphetamine that were found in his system, but prosecutors argue that Chauvin had killed him by kneeling on him for more than nine minutes and cutting off his air supply.
Tobin was adamant that Chauvin’s actions had caused Floyd’s death on May 25. He pinpointed the exact moment, in the graphic bystander video of the arrest, in which he said Floyd had died, noting that his eyes had opened wide and then closed again. At that point, Chauvin’s knee remained on his neck.
“You can see his eyes — he’s conscious — and then you see that he isn’t,” Tobin said. “That’s the moment the life goes out of his body.”
The doctor also rejected the defense’s arguments about drugs, saying that videos show Floyd breathing at a normal rate before he went unconscious, meaning any fentanyl in his system was “not having an effect” on his breathing.
“A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died,” Tobin said.
Eric J. Nelson, the lawyer for Chauvin, pushed back on Tobin’s testimony during his questioning and suggested that Floyd could have died of an overdose. Tobin agreed that fentanyl could have hindered Floyd’s breathing if he had taken the drug in the minutes before police officers pushed him to the ground, but the doctor said Floyd had never gone into a coma, something he said would happen before a person dies of a fentanyl overdose. Nelson also sought to portray the medical care that Floyd received from paramedics as lacking, saying they had not inserted a tube down Floyd’s throat until nine minutes after they arrived.
In his testimony, Tobin said he had determined that Chauvin had pressed his left knee on Floyd’s neck for more than 90% of the time that Floyd was on the ground, and that he had kept his right knee on Floyd’s back for the majority of the time as well. That pressure, combined with having his hands cuffed behind his back and pushed into the street facedown, had cut off oxygen and caused his heart to stop, Tobin said.
“He was being squashed between the two sides,” he said.
Floyd was so desperate for air at one point that he tried to lift himself off the ground by pushing his right knuckle against a police car’s tire, the doctor said.
Tobin, who works in pulmonology and critical care at Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Affairs Hospital and at Loyola University’s medical school, spoke for more than two hours to jurors. He said he had asked not to be paid when prosecutors asked if he would testify in the case. At several points, he encouraged jurors to feel parts of their own necks to demonstrate what he was saying; most of them followed along.
Tobin said the factors that cut off Floyd’s air supply had led to what could be called “asphyxia,” which he said was just another word for oxygen deprivation; a prosecutor told jurors when the trial began that Floyd had died of asphyxia.
At one point in a video of Floyd’s arrest, Tobin noted, Chauvin’s left foot appeared to rise off the ground, which the doctor said meant that half of Chauvin’s body weight was pressing on Floyd’s neck.
After about four minutes, 51 seconds, Tobin said, Floyd stopped speaking or groaning. After just over five minutes, Floyd appeared to straighten out his legs, which Tobin said was a signal that Floyd was having a type of seizure because he had suffered a brain injury from the oxygen deprivation. He said Chauvin’s knee had stayed on Floyd’s neck for three minutes, 27 seconds after he took his last breath.
The doctor said the handcuffs were also an “extremely important” factor in Floyd’s death because Chauvin and another officer had pushed his hands upward and against his back, pressing his chest against the hard street.
“When you’re turned prone and with the knee on the back, now the work that Mr. Floyd has to perform becomes huge,” Tobin said, adding: “He has to try to lift up the officer’s knee with each breath.”

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Dr. Andrew Baker may be one of the most important witnesses to be called in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin. It was his duty to determine why George Floyd died.
Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner, conducted Floyd’s initial autopsy and determined ultimately that his heart and lungs stopped functioning while he was being subdued, restrained and compressed by police officers.
The manner of Floyd’s death, Baker concluded, was homicide. And in the months since, almost everything he said in the autopsy report has been parsed and pored over by experts and laypeople alike.
In opening statements last week, the prosecution indicated that they would pursue an unusual strategy: challenging some aspects of Baker’s findings and introducing a reason that he did not cite — insufficient oxygen — as Floyd’s cause of death.
For their part, Chauvin’s defense team told jurors that the preexisting heart disease, high blood pressure and recent drug use documented by Baker led to Floyd’s death from what they said was a heart arrhythmia.
As the trial nears a phase where Floyd’s cause of death will take center stage, we talked with several forensic pathologists uninvolved in the case to explain some of the terms used in the proceedings, how they determine the cause and manner of death, and how this relates to the case. Here is what we learned.
What is a medical examiner?
In the United States, some jurisdictions use coroners and others use medical examiners to determine the cause of certain deaths, including those that occur in police custody. Unlike coroners, medical examiners are required to be physicians. Baker, who is expected to testify in the coming days, is certified in the field of forensic pathology and is the chief medical examiner of Hennepin County.
The medical examiner’s office is an independent agency; it is not part of law enforcement.
Is there always one cause of death?
When someone dies, a death certificate is filled out for both public health and legal reasons. The form includes a cause of death in the first section and contributing factors in the second section.
“We usually have to come up with one cause,” said Dr. Judy Melinek, a board-certified forensic pathologist. Everything else significant “that might be wrong with a person is ‘contributing.’”
Pathologists describe the cause of death as the immediate injury or disease that leads to death. It is the “disease or injury which starts the lethal sequence of events without an intervening cause,” Melinek said.
What is the manner of death?
The manner of death refers to the circumstances surrounding the death. There are usually five choices (a few jurisdictions include more): natural, accident, suicide, homicide or undetermined.
Homicide is often described as “death at the hands of another or others.” A homicide is not necessarily criminal; homicides can be a matter of self-defense, for example. The courts, not medical examiners, determine criminal culpability.
Is more than an autopsy considered?
In addition to examining the body, which usually occurs quickly, pathologists consider other materials such as the police report, videos, medical records and toxicology reports, said Dr. Priya Banerjee, a board-certified forensic pathologist.
“We don’t practice in a black box,” she said.
Until all the results of the investigation are in, she said, she typically says the case is pending further study.
Are the cause and manner of death always clear?
In a vast majority of cases, the cause and manner of death are evident, forensic pathologists say. But in some situations, the professional opinions of well-trained and experienced experts can differ.
“Some cases are much more complicated than others,” Banerjee said. When an “autopsy wasn’t a slam dunk,” Banerjee said, the written cause of death can be “more verbose because it’s taking into consideration many things.”
That can occur when an autopsy does not reveal a lethal injury like a gunshot wound to the brain.
“Autopsies are good at showing demonstrable changes in the body’s tissues,” said Dr. Christopher Happy, a board-certified forensic pathologist, “but they’re not good at showing things that were functional, like a seizure or respiratory depression or an arrhythmia, unless there’s some lesion associated with that.”
What did Baker ultimately determine?
Baker described Floyd’s cause of death as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” The manner of death, he wrote, was homicide.
The use of the term cardiopulmonary arrest led to public confusion because some people wrongly assumed it meant that Floyd had a heart attack. Cardiopulmonary arrest means “the heart stops beating and the lungs stop moving,” Dr. Cyril Wecht said.
Some pathologists say they do not include it as a cause of death because it describes all deaths.
Baker also detailed “other significant conditions,” including preexisting ones such as severe disease of the vessels of Floyd’s heart. He also described laboratory findings of the opiate drug fentanyl and methamphetamines in Floyd’s blood. Not including these under cause of death means he concluded that “those were there before but didn’t start the lethal sequence of events,” Melinek said. Listing them “is meant to clarify” what made Floyd more vulnerable to the cause of death, she said, “not excuse it.”
Here, context matters. Baker told prosecutors that if Floyd had been “found dead at home alone” with “no other apparent causes,” they wrote, it could have been acceptable to determine that Floyd died of an overdose because of the relatively high levels of fentanyl found in his blood collected at the hospital.
Instead, recordings revealed both the prolonged restraint of Floyd just before his death and also that he appeared agitated rather than lethargic, which could suggest tolerance to higher doses of fentanyl. The drug typically “causes you to become relaxed,” Wecht said.
By contrast, Melinek said, Chauvin’s defense attorneys appear to be trying to use the medical findings to convince the jury that Floyd “was essentially a ticking time bomb, already had preexisting conditions that made this endpoint happen, not because excessive force was used.”
Only asserting that he was at higher risk of death from police restraint because of underlying health conditions or drug use would likely be legally insufficient, some experts said.
What did his preliminary findings say?
The medical examiner’s office had not finished its investigation when prosecutors filed a charging document saying that preliminary findings had shown no physical evidence to support a diagnosis of “traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” It said that the combined effects of police restraint, underlying health conditions including heart disease and “any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.”
Forensic pathologists said that in high-profile cases, it can be problematic to release findings early because they may be misinterpreted or incomplete.
“I basically never release preliminary cause of death,” Banerjee said.
What did a second autopsy of Floyd find?
After the initial autopsy, forensic pathologists no longer have access to an intact body, and sometimes organs or tissues are unavailable, having been removed for further study. Even so, doctors sometimes document findings that an examiner missed in the first autopsy or that were not apparent.
“There are multiple reasons you might see something at second autopsy that’s not seen at the first and vice versa,” Melinek said.
Floyd’s family hired Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Allecia Wilson to perform a second autopsy. Both experts said that pressure on Floyd’s neck and back during his restraint by the police led him to die of asphyxia, a term Baker did not use in his official report.
The word asphyxia derives from an ancient Greek term that means “without pulse.” Doctors now use it to mean the deprivation of oxygen, which can occur for many reasons. At the center of the case is whether Chauvin’s actions led to any of them, such as inhibiting the movement of the diaphragm that allows the lungs to expand, or reducing the flow of blood carrying oxygen to vital tissues. Oxygen deprivation may occur not only from neck compression, experts said, but also from pressure on the back when someone is lying face down, and it may not leave major physical traces.
The cause of death described by both Baker and the pathologists who performed the second autopsy amounted to substantially the same thing, some experts said, which was “that external pressure in a prone position to Floyd caused his death,” Banerjee said.

Visual Artist From Brooklyn Wants Sports Fans to Wear Their Names: [Sports Desk]

Full text: A Brooklyn artist uses sports iconography to commemorate Trayvon Martin, George Floyd and other Black victims of violence.
The irony has always troubled Raafi Rivero. "People love Black athletes," he said. "But they don't love Black people."
In July 2013, it resonated anew for Rivero, a lifelong sports fan, when George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing of Black teenager Trayvon Martin, the same weekend Rivero saw the film "Fruitvale Station," about the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant, who was also Black.
"I cried several times that weekend, and I really felt powerless," Rivero said from Santa Fe last month during a videoconference interview. "I was asking myself, What can I do?"
Rivero, a filmmaker with a background in design, poured his emotion into a piece of art that eventually became part of a series that has gone from the digital space to real-world recognition across the country. Rivero used Adobe Illustrator to design an image of a black and yellow basketball jersey with "Unarmed" on the front and "Martin 17" on the back. Trayvon Martin was 17 and unarmed when he was shot, and in reading about his death, Rivero kept seeing a photo of Martin in a black and yellow football jersey.
Grimly, Rivero, 43, has continued to commemorate other unarmed Black victims in the years after the Zimmerman verdict. His digital jersey illustrations grew to include Eric Garner, who was killed in July 2014 in Staten Island by a New York City police officer using an illegal chokehold. Three weeks later, a Ferguson, Mo., police officer killed Michael Brown. By then Rivero had developed an intentional design system for the project: Each jersey bears the colors of the victim's local sports team with a jersey number that corresponds to the person's age at death. Stars, if present, represent how many times the person was shot.
"It felt like people were trying to explain these killings away with the 'bad apples' argument, but it keeps happening. There is a through line in these killings," Rivero said. "And it felt empowering to say something in this way."
Rivero's way kept the victims' names alive differently than other protests by placing them within the iconography of America's favorite pastimes. "My father used to always say that sports are democratic," Rivero said. "The only arena where a Black man and white man could compete on an even playing field."
Sports also carry the nostalgic symbolism of youthful innocence. "One of the best moments was always when you got your jersey, your number. I'd just want to wear it all the time," he said. "Jerseys were sacred objects for me."
"Unarmed" remained an erratic social media project over the next few years, as Rivero juggled corporate and media design work while grappling with the emotional pain of starting new installments.
Then George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in May 2020. Rivero explained through tears that for more than a week he couldn't bring himself to watch the video of the killing and, at first, had no interest in making yet another jersey. But as Black Lives Matter protests gained momentum throughout New York and the country, he found the resolve to design another. "My life changed when I designed the George Floyd jersey," Rivero said.
A friend of Rivero's, who has a printing company, called him the morning after he'd shared the Floyd design on Instagram. He suggested they create large vinyl prints of Rivero's jersey designs to post. "Less than a week later, they were up across from Barclays Center," Rivero said.
The Downtown Brooklyn arena had become a hub for daily Black Lives Matter protests and Rivero's art hung in the backdrop, with dark irony, on the boarded-up windows of nearby sports businesses Modell's, the sneaker boutique Kith, and Crunch Fitness.
Steven Heller, a co-chair of the M.F.A. Design Department at the School of Visual Arts, was so struck by the use of commercial branding to convey a pointed social message that he interviewed Rivero for DesignObserver, a website that covers design and culture. "Raafi Rivero is quoting popular culture in a way that is both obvious and nuance," Heller said in an email interview with The New York Times. "The viewer is unaware of the message immediately, which allows for its resonance to sneak in rather than hit you on the head -- although it does that, too."
Though sports have not traditionally made their way into the fine art establishment, the use of sports as a conveyance for forms of protest has forced the art world to take note. The 2019 Whitney Biennial featured several pieces that incorporated elements from the sports world, most notably, Kota Ezawa's "National Anthem," an animated video that shows N.F.L. players kneeling during the "Star-Spangled Banner" to protest police violence against unarmed Black people.
"We love a work of art about protest that isn't bombastic," said Jane Panetta, a co-curator of the museum's hallmark survey. "Quiet, tactile, interpretive. Colin Kaepernick's kneeling protest really captured the country, and the more time that passed, the more resonant it felt. Today it feels even more powerful."
With "Unarmed" as his professional focus, and supported by a grant from the V-Day Foundation, Rivero bought a used car, filled it with camera equipment, and left New York last fall determined to capture what was happening in America. Rivero visited Louisville, Ky., Kenosha, Wis., Milwaukee, Minneapolis and Denver, hanging his pieces and speaking with local residents about the tragic killings and violence in their communities. He recorded the trip and used the footage to create the short film, "Unarmed." It debuted as part of YouTube's "Black Renaissance," a Black History Month special hosted by the Obamas that has been viewed more than 3.5 million times. He exhibited the jerseys at Leon Gallery in Denver last winter.
Though Rivero gave up his Brooklyn apartment before embarking on the cross-country journey and hasn't returned since, he expects to be back later this month. He's got another set of vinyl prints he's prepared to hang up, and after enough people asked about wearable jerseys, he is in the final production of a Trayvon Martin edition. If Martin's family members approve, he'd like to start selling the jersey, and then create others, using proceeds to support the victims' families and donate to antiracism organizations.
"When you go to a ballgame in Denver, instead of wearing a Jamal Murray, wouldn't there be someone who wants to wear an Elijah McClain jersey? I'd love to see that," Rivero said.

The trial of former officer Derek Chauvin resumed Wednesday with testimony from Sgt. Jody Stiger of the Los Angeles Police Department, who is expected to be the only outside expert to testify for the state about police training and use of force. Here are some key takeaways from the eighth day of the trial.
Increased Risk of Death
A use-of-force expert with the Los Angeles Police Department testified Wednesday that Derek Chauvin had used “deadly force” on George Floyd at a time when it was not appropriate to use any force.
Stiger, who works with the LAPD Inspector General’s Office to investigate wrongdoing in the department, reviewed evidence in the Chauvin case for prosecutors and said Chauvin had put Floyd at risk of positional asphyxia, a key point for prosecutors who have argued that Floyd died of asphyxia, meaning a loss of oxygen.
Stiger said that even being handcuffed and in a prone position could make it harder to breathe.
“When you add body weight to that, it just increases the possibility of death,” he said.
The testimony from Stiger came on the eighth day of the trial of Chauvin, who has been charged with murdering Floyd. The sergeant has said that the officers who arrested Floyd were initially justified in using force to try to put him in the back of a police car and put him in the prone position but “should have slowed down or stopped their force” once Floyd was on the ground.
Stiger said that while Chauvin knelt on Floyd, he had appeared to use a “pain compliance” technique on one of Floyd’s hands. Stiger said Chauvin could be seen, in body camera video, either pushing Floyd’s knuckles together or pulling his wrist against his handcuffs to hurt him. The sergeant said he could hear the handcuffs ratcheting tighter in one of the videos.
Those techniques may be appropriate to get a person to comply with police commands, Stiger said, but he indicated that there was no opportunity for Floyd to comply.
“At that point, it’s just pain,” Stiger said.
Things Can Be ‘Missed’
In the cross-examination of Stiger, the lawyer for Chauvin, Eric Nelson, played a short video of Floyd handcuffed on the ground and asked the sergeant if it sounded like Floyd was saying, “I ate too many drugs.” Stiger said he could not make out what Floyd had said, at which point Nelson asked him if things can be “missed” in a chaotic scene. The sergeant agreed that they could.
Stiger also agreed, in response to Nelson’s questioning, that it would have been appropriate for Chauvin to use a Taser on Floyd when he first arrived on scene, given that Floyd appeared to be resisting the officers. Still, the jury has heard from experts — including Stiger — who said the appropriate level of force changed once Floyd was on the ground and no longer resisting.
Nelson emphasized that the sergeant was an outside expert who worked for the Los Angeles Police Department, which he joined in 1993, and might not be as familiar with Minneapolis police policies.
Nelson also highlighted that the Minneapolis Police Department’s policies on using force give discretion to officers. He read from one portion of the department’s policy that says that the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force has to be judged “from the perspective of the reasonable officer on the scene rather than with the 20-20 vision of hindsight."
Crowd Grew ‘Concerned’
Since the first day of the trial, it has been one of the central arguments in his defense: that the bystanders who witnessed Floyd’s arrest in May in Minneapolis also influenced Chauvin’s actions.
On Wednesday, Nelson returned again to the crowd of people who had gathered outside Cup Foods and watched Chauvin kneel on Floyd, their voices raised and their cellphones recording. Nelson repeated insults that had been heard on videos recorded that day and suggested that the bystanders made up an aggressive, unpredictable group.
Asked if the crowd was growing “more excited,” Stiger answered, “They became more concerned.”
In response to a prosecutor’s question, Stiger said he did not find the crowd to be a threat to the officers.
On Tuesday, Officer Nicole Mackenzie, the medical support coordinator for the Minneapolis Police Department, agreed with an assertion by Chauvin’s lawyer that a crowd of vocal bystanders could make it difficult for an officer to render medical aid during an arrest. Lt. Johnny Mercil, a veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department and use-of-force instructor, also said that hostile bystanders could raise alarm with officers.
Police policies generally advise how officers should react when they are being heckled by bystanders or filmed with smartphones, an increasingly common occurrence, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit in Washington.
Three other officers were present during Floyd’s arrest, and in an ideal situation, Wexler said, Chauvin would not have been directly monitoring the crowd.
“There’s a division of labor there,” Wexler said. “You would hope that there would be enough officers so that some can handle the crowd. But Officer Chauvin should be focused on Mr. Floyd and his well-being, and the other officers should be focused on the crowd.”
Defining Neck Restraints
When reviewing a picture of Chauvin pinning Floyd to the ground, Mercil told prosecutors that Chauvin’s position was not consistent with the Minneapolis Police Department’s training on use of force. In addition, Mercil said that officers were trained to “use the lowest level of force possible” when controlling a subject.
Still, Nelson made some potential headway with the testimony of Mercil. Asked about neck restraints, Mercil said it generally takes less than 10 seconds for a person to become unconscious because of a neck restraint. The question could allow Nelson to argue that Chauvin’s knee did not qualify as a neck restraint because it took several minutes for Floyd to lose consciousness.

‘I Ate Too Many Drugs’ or ‘I Ain’t Do No Drugs’?
James Reyerson of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension testified Wednesday, offering a view of the death of Floyd from an agent who was tasked with investigating it.
In testimony that revived questions about Floyd’s drug use, Reyerson, a special agent, initially agreed with Chauvin’s defense lawyer that Floyd appeared to have shouted “I ate too many drugs” as he was handcuffed on the ground.
But later, when questioned by a prosecutor and shown a longer video clip, Reyerson changed his conclusion, saying he thought Floyd had actually shouted, “I ain’t do no drugs.”
Another expert, Stiger, said in earlier testimony that it was unclear to him what Floyd had said in that moment, and the audio is difficult to make out. Prosecutors have spent considerable time during their presentation dealing with the defense’s assertions that the fentanyl and methamphetamine found in Floyd’s system led to his death.
Reyerson described his own law enforcement career, which included work for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the New York Police Department.
Reyerson said his agency had prepared 440 reports during the course of the investigation of Floyd’s death.

Just What Constitutes ‘Proportional Force’?

The phrase “proportional force” or “proportional use of force” has been mentioned several times during the trial.
So what is it exactly? Proportional force is the idea that the force that a police officer is supposed to use on a suspect, including the use of chokeholds or other neck restraints, should not be more intense than necessary.
The manual of the Minneapolis Police Department states that neck restraints and chokeholds are basically reserved for when an officer feels caught in a life-or-death situation.
When determining the level of force to use, officers should consider the severity of the crime, the mental condition of the person under arrest, whether the person is resisting or presents a threat to the officer, and other factors that may influence the situation.
The manual further explains that the conscious neck restraint may be used against a subject who is “actively resisting,” while rendering the person unconscious should be limited to someone who is aggressive or “for lifesaving purposes.”
Most police departments have based their policies on a Supreme Court case, Graham v. Connor, which acknowledges that reasonableness depends on the situation, Stiger testified.
Nelson, Chauvin's defense attorney, pointed out that under Graham v. Connor, reasonableness must be considered in the moment, without the use of 20/20 hindsight. The defense’s challenge is that this case does not involve split-second decision-making, but 9 minutes, 29 seconds of kneeling on a suspect.

The Reason for the Headsets
A common sight during the trial of Chauvin has been the judge, the prosecutors and Chauvin’s lawyer putting on headphones and carrying on a conversation that cannot be heard on the livestream.
What is happening here is a common part of a court hearing, known as a sidebar. These are usually brief discussions between the lawyers and the judge about scheduling, a point of law or a matter that they do not want the jury to hear, such as arguments over whether an objection to a line of questioning will be sustained or overruled.
Traditionally, such discussions happen with the lawyers and the judge huddled together and speaking in hushed tones. But because of coronavirus protocols in this trial, the answer to the question, “May I approach the bench?” is a definite “No.” So by using microphones and headsets, and by playing white noise to the jurors, the sidebar can happen with the participants at a safe distance.
“Please understand we are not attempting to conceal anything from you which it is necessary for you to hear,” Judge Peter Cahill told the jury at the beginning of the trial.
And, he added, “Please do not attempt to listen in.”

Witnesses called by the prosecution in the Derek Chauvin trial provided a deeper look at police policies on the use of force on Tuesday and gave the former Minneapolis police officer’s defense team some potential openings.
Chauvin’s defense, led by attorney Eric J. Nelson, tried to bolster its argument that the crowd that formed on the sidewalk during George Floyd’s arrest might have made it more difficult for Chauvin to render medical aid or to move his knee, which he held on Floyd for more than nine minutes.
While the first week of the trial brought emotional testimony from bystanders, Tuesday’s proceedings seemed to cement the trial into the second phase: focusing on whether Chauvin, who is accused of murder in Floyd’s death, violated police policy, or whether his actions lined up with his training. Here are the highlights from Tuesday.
— Nelson found some testimony from prosecution witnesses that could support his arguments. Officer Nicole Mackenzie, the medical support coordinator for the Minneapolis Police Department, agreed with Nelson’s assertion that a crowd of vocal bystanders can make it difficult for an officer to render medical aid during an arrest. Lt. Johnny Mercil, a veteran of the Minneapolis Police Department and use-of-force instructor, also said that hostile bystanders could raise alarm with officers. Nelson has suggested throughout the trial that the crowd outside the Cup Foods convenience store, which yelled at Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd for 9 1/2 minutes, might have hindered the former officer from helping Floyd once he became unresponsive.
— Nelson hit on a similar theme during the questioning of Sgt. Ker Yang, a crisis intervention coordinator with the Minneapolis Police Department. He asked whether an officer can “look bad” even when applying force that is lawful, and asked whether officers are tasked with weighing possible threats, such as a crowd of bystanders, when applying force. “You’re taking in a lot of information and processing it all kind of simultaneously through this critical decision-making model,” Nelson said. Yang agreed.
— Los Angeles Police Sgt. Jody Stiger, a use-of-force expert, told prosecutors that Floyd kicked at officers as a possible attempt to break free from their grasp. Still, Stiger said that kick was the only such attempt by Floyd. He also said that, based on his review of body camera footage, Floyd seemed to comply with officers shortly after they placed him facedown on the pavement, with his hands cuffed behind his back.
— When reviewing a picture of Chauvin pinning Floyd to the ground, Mercil told prosecutors that Chauvin’s position was not consistent with the Minneapolis Police Department’s training on use of force. In addition, Mercil said that officers are trained to “use the lowest level of force possible” when controlling a subject. Chauvin kept Floyd pinned for several minutes even after he became unresponsive. Still, Nelson made some potential headway with the testimony of Mercil. Asked about neck restraints, Mercil said it generally takes less than 10 seconds for a person to become unconscious because of a neck restraint. The question could allow Nelson to argue that Chauvin’s knee did not qualify as a neck restraint, because it took several minutes for Floyd to lose consciousness.

Amid Awakening, Asian Americans Are Still Taking Shape as a Political Force

When Mike Park first heard about the recent shootings in Atlanta, he felt angry and afraid. But almost immediately, he had another thought.
“We can’t just sit back,” he said. “We can’t sit in our little enclave anymore.”
Born in South Carolina to Korean immigrants, Park grew up wanting to escape his Asian identity. He resented having to be the one student to speak at Asian-Pacific day and felt embarrassed when his friends did not want to eat dinner at his house because of the unfamiliar pickled radishes and cabbage in his refrigerator.
Now 42, Park embraces both his Korean heritage and an Asian American identity he shares with others of his generation. The Atlanta shootings that left eight dead, six of them women of Asian descent, made him feel an even stronger sense of solidarity, especially after a surge in bias incidents against Asians nationwide.
“I do think this horrible crime has brought people together,” said Park, who works as an insurance agent in Duluth, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb that is one-quarter Asian. “It really is an awakening.”
For years, Asian Americans were among the least likely of any racial or ethnic group to vote or to join community or advocacy groups. Today they are surging into public life, running for office in record numbers and turning out to vote unlike ever before. They are now the fastest-growing group in the U.S. electorate.
But as a political force, Asian Americans are still taking shape. With a relatively short history of voting, they differ from demographic groups whose families have built party loyalties and voting tendencies over generations. Most of their families arrived after 1965, when the United States opened its doors more widely to people in Asia. There are vast class divisions, too; the income gap between the rich and the poor is greatest among Asian Americans.
“These are your classic swing voters,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, president of AAPI Data. “These immigrants did not grow up in a Democratic household or Republican household. You have a lot more persuadability.”
Historical data on Asian American voting patterns is spotty. Analyses of exit polls show that a majority voted for George Bush in 1992, Ramakrishnan said. Today, a majority of Asians vote for Democrats, but that masks deep differences by subgroup. Vietnamese Americans, for example, lean more toward Republicans, and Indian Americans lean strongly toward Democrats.
It is too early for final breakdowns of the Asian American vote in 2020, along either party or ethnic lines. But one thing seems clear: Turnout for Asian Americans appears to have been higher than it has ever been. Ramakrishnan analyzed preliminary estimates from the voter data firm Catalist that were based on available returns from 33 states representing two-third of eligible Asian American voters. The estimates found that adult Asian American citizens had the highest recorded increase in voter turnout among any racial or ethnic group.
As relatively new voters, many Asian Americans find themselves uniquely interested in both major parties, drawn to Democrats for their stances on guns and health care and to Republicans for their support for small business and emphasis on self-reliance. But they do not fit into neat categories. The Democratic position on immigration attracts some and repels others. The Republican anti-Communist language is compelling to some. Others are indifferent.
Former President Donald Trump’s repeated reference to the “China virus” repelled many Chinese American voters, and the Democrats’ support for affirmative action policies in schools has drawn strong opposition from some Asian groups. Even the violence and slurs against Asians, which began spiking after the coronavirus began to spread last spring, have pushed people in different directions politically. Some blame Trump and his followers. Others see Republicans as supporters of the police and law and order.
Yeun Jae Kim, 32, voted for the first time last year. His parents had moved from Seoul, South Korea, to a Florida suburb when he was a child and started a truck parts salvage business. Kim went on to graduate from Georgia Tech and then to a job at Coca-Cola in Atlanta, but, like his parents, he was so focused on making it that he did not vote or think about politics much at all.
Last year changed his mind. But how to vote and whom to choose? He and his wife spent hours watching videos on YouTube and talking at church to a politically experienced friend, also a Korean American.
“For me it was pretty hard,” said Kim, who described himself as “in the middle” politically. “There are certain things I really like about what the Democratic Party is doing. And there are certain things I really like about what the Republicans are doing.”
He wanted to keep his vote private. But he said that casting a ballot made him feel good.
“It made me feel really proud of the country,” he said. “Like everybody is in this together. It helped me feel connected with other people who were voting too.”
Part of the new energy in Asian American politics comes from second-generation immigrants, who are now in their 30s and 40s and are forming families that are far more racially mixed and civically engaged than those of their parents. A new Asian American identity is being forged from dozens of languages, cultures and histories.
“Right now, it is this coming of age,” said Marc Ang, 39, a conservative political activist and business owner in Orange County, California.
His father, an immigrant from the Philippines of Chinese descent, came to California in the 1980s as a white-collar worker in the steel industry. The state is now home to about one-third of the country’s Asian American population.
“Suddenly we are top doctors, top lawyers, top business people,” said Ang, who pointed out that the approximately 6 million Asians in California are equivalent to the size of Singapore. “It is just inevitable that we become a voting bloc.”
Ang, a Republican, worked to defeat an affirmative action proposition in California last year. But he praised Democrats and their efforts to draw attention to the storm of slurs and physical attacks over the past year, which he said have been a galvanizing force, unifying even the least politically involved people from countries as different as China, Vietnam, the Philippines and South Korea.
More Asian Americans are running for office than ever before. They include Andrew Yang, among the early leaders in the race for New York mayor, and Michelle Wu, the city councilor who is running for mayor of Boston. A Filipino American, Robert Bonta, just became attorney general of California.
At least 158 Asian Americans ran for state legislatures in 2020, according to AAPI Data, up by 15% from 2018.
Marvin Lim, a Georgia state representative, calls himself a 1.5-generation immigrant: He came to the United States from the Philippines when he was 7.
Lim spent a number of years on public assistance and said his family “did not see the bootstraps working for us.” He became a civil rights lawyer and began to vote for Democrats because their values, he said, aligned more with his. Now 36, he won a House seat in Georgia in November and last month met with President Joe Biden during his visit to Atlanta after the shootings.
“I have never felt more like I mattered,” he said.
Asian Americans lean toward Democrats — all the more so among the American-born. But there are things pushing Asians away from the Democrats as well.
Anthony Lam, a Vietnamese immigrant who fled as a refugee in the 1970s and grew up working class in Los Angeles, had usually voted for Democrats. But as the owner of a hair salon in San Diego, he became increasingly frustrated with directives for coronavirus lockdowns and turned off by the unrest during Black Lives Matter protests. When he criticized the looting, he said some white Democrats chastised him.
“They said, ‘You don’t understand racism,’” he said. “I’m like, ‘Wait a minute. You get racism just now? I’ve been living with this for 40 years.’”
Lam voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. He supported Yang in the Democratic primary last year. But he said he eventually voted for Trump, mostly out of frustration with Democrats.
Despite recent increases in political representation, some Asian American communities still feel invisible, and some members argue that could lead to a rightward turn.
Rob Yang, a Hmong American who owns shoe and apparel stores in Minneapolis and St. Paul, grew up poor as a refugee. He has watched the turmoil in the wake of the George Floyd killing in his traditional, largely working-class Hmong community. His own stores were stripped of their merchandise during the Black Lives Matter protests.
He voted for Biden. He said that he supported the Black Lives Matter movement but that some in his community did not. Years of feeling invisible had frustrated and demoralized them.
The way he sees it, Asians still do not have enough of a voice, and he worries that the pressure of holding everything in for years is reaching dangerous levels. He said he worried that a populist Asian leader, “an Asian Trump,” could have a huge following by tapping into this frustration.
“We’ve been holding it all in for so long, it will just take the right circumstances for us to blow,” he said.
For Park, the insurance agent in suburban Atlanta, the attacks in his city and others across America were a searing reminder that economic success does not ensure protection from the racial animus that is part of American life. It is now up to Asian Americans, he said, to stand up and claim their space in U.S. politics.
“It’s moving away from the idea that ‘the nail that sticks out gets hammered in,’” he said. “We are realizing it’s OK to stick out.”

The first week of the murder trial of Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis was marked by emotional accounts from bystanders who watched Chauvin pin George Floyd to the ground for more than nine minutes in May.
The prosecution presented testimony, often accompanied by tears and shaking voices, from people who were there during the fatal arrest of Floyd, along with hours of video evidence and additional testimony from paramedics and law enforcement officials who said that Chauvin’s use of force was unnecessary.
Prosecutors also introduced the issue of Floyd’s drug use, which is expected to be a crucial part of Chauvin’s defense; Chauvin’s lawyers are expected to argue that Floyd’s death was a result of his drug use. The trial, one of the most viewed in decades, comes with the memory of last summer’s protests for racial justice fresh in people’s minds.
Here are six key points from the first week of the trial.
Lawyers outlined their opposing strategies.
On Monday, each side laid out its strategy in opening statements.
Eric Nelson, the lawyer for Chauvin, made clear on Monday that he would attempt to convince jurors that the videos of Floyd’s death did not tell the full story. The case “is clearly more than about 9 minutes and 29 seconds,” Nelson said, referring to the time that Chauvin knelt on Floyd. He signaled that he planned to argue that Chauvin had been following his training, that his knee was not necessarily on Floyd’s neck and that Floyd’s death may have been caused by drugs.
One of the prosecutors, Jerry Blackwell, urged jurors to “believe your eyes, that it’s homicide — it’s murder.” Prosecutors call all of their witnesses before the defense begins to lay out its case, so the week was heavily weighted toward the prosecution’s arguments, but the strategies of both sides began to come into view.
Witnesses revealed a sense of shared trauma.
The trial began with powerful testimony from a series of witnesses to the arrest, many of whom broke down in tears while recounting what they saw. They included several women who were younger than 18 at the time of the arrest as well as a 61-year-old man who spoke with Floyd while he was pinned to the ground. From the convenience store clerk at the Cup Foods where Floyd bought cigarettes to an off-duty firefighter who yelled at the officers as Floyd became unresponsive, they conveyed a shared sense of trauma from what they saw that day.
By highlighting the emotional trauma Floyd’s arrest caused witnesses, prosecutors seemingly hoped to convince jurors that Chauvin’s actions had been clearly excessive to people who saw them in real time. One witness, Darnella Frazier, now 18, testified that she has been haunted by what she saw, sometimes lying awake at night “apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.”
The fateful arrest was replayed from every angle.
For the first time, the final moments before Floyd’s arrest were shown in detail. Surveillance video from Cup Foods, along with testimony from the store clerk, showed Floyd walking around the store, chatting and laughing with customers and eventually buying a pack of cigarettes with a $20 bill that the clerk suspected was fake.
Footage from police body cameras then replayed the arrest from beginning to end. It showed an officer approach Floyd with his pistol drawn and captured audio of Floyd’s fearful reaction: “Please, don’t shoot me,” he said. Floyd appeared terrified, first of the pistol, then of being held in a police car. As Chauvin pinned him to the ground, the footage captured the moments when the officers checked for a pulse and found none but took no action.
The pivotal issue of drug use was directly addressed.
On Thursday, jurors heard from Courteney Ross, Floyd’s girlfriend at the time of his death. Through stories of their first kiss, their dates and his hobbies, prosecutors used Ross’ testimony to show Floyd’s humanity as a father, partner and friend.
Ross’ testimony also brought one of the most important aspects of the trial to the forefront: Floyd’s drug use. The role that drugs did or did not play in Floyd’s death is expected to be a crucial element of Chauvin’s defense, and prosecutors called Ross to the stand to get in front of the claims of Chauvin’s lawyer.
Ross said that she and Floyd had first been prescribed painkillers to ease chronic pain but that when the prescriptions ran out, they continued to buy the pills from others. They had begun a battle for sobriety, sometimes avoiding the drugs before they relapsed again. In the weeks before Floyd’s death, Ross said, she suspected that he had begun using again.
Prosecutors sought to show that Floyd had built up a high tolerance of the drugs, making it less likely that he died of an overdose; Floyd had methamphetamine and fentanyl in his system at the time of his death, according to a toxicology report.
At the scene, there were no signs of life.
Two paramedics who responded to the scene both testified that they saw no signs of life from Floyd upon their arrival. One of them, Derek Smith, felt Floyd’s neck while police officers were still on top of him and said he found no pulse. Smith’s attempts to revive him, including the use of a defibrillator and a machine that provides chest compressions, did nothing to improve Floyd’s condition. Although the paramedics did not address what exactly killed Floyd, their testimony seemed to support prosecutors’ claim that Chauvin’s actions resulted in his death.
A tactic was called ‘deadly force.’
On Friday, Lt. Richard Zimmerman, the longest-serving officer in the Minneapolis Police Department, offered scathing condemnation of Chauvin’s use of force. He said Chauvin violated police policy and called his actions “totally unnecessary.” Putting a knee on someone’s neck while they are handcuffed in a prone position, he said, qualifies as “deadly force.”
“If your knee is on a person’s neck, that can kill them,” Zimmerman said, adding that people who are handcuffed generally pose little threat to officers. Zimmerman’s testimony, bolstered by his more than 35 years on the force, could be a major setback for a crucial aspect of Chauvin’s defense: that his actions were not only legal but also within the bounds of his training.

Imagine that you’re walking on the street and see a man viciously beating an older woman.
What would you, just a passerby, do?
That question — about the ethical responsibility to help a stranger in distress and the dynamics that prevent people from acting — has been the focus of research for decades and helps inform some of the debate this past week around two chilling incidents.
In one, a man pummels and chokes a subway passenger in New York into unconsciousness; in the other, an assailant on a busy Midtown street in Manhattan knocks a Filipino immigrant to the ground and then repeatedly kicks her head.
The videos, which were posted, prompted swift condemnation, with many asking why witnesses had seemingly failed to intervene during the acts of violence. For many, the incidents revived a common complaint about the atomized selfishness of big city residents.
“New York has, once again, cemented its long-standing reputation for apathy,” wrote Alex Lo, a columnist for The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. “Given the level of ethnic violence against Asians that has been widely reported in recent months, it’s all the more puzzling why no one saw fit to intervene to help those two victims.”
But those who study what’s known as the bystander effect say the narrative of callous apathy is an outdated trope that dates to a New York Times account of the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese. She was a bar manager stabbed to death outside her building in Queens while three dozen neighbors supposedly ignored her cries for help. Although many key details of the article have since been debunked — the claim that 38 people witnessed the crime, for one, was greatly exaggerated — the account gained international attention and fueled a largely one-side debate about the perils of urban living.
The crime also gave birth to an entire branch of psychology dedicated to understanding the behavioral dynamics of people confronted by public violence. And in the intervening years, researchers have found that popular beliefs about the cold detachment of urban dwellers is largely a canard, one sustained by headline-grabbing media accounts of people who appear to ignore a crime in progress. Such incidents, experts say, are actually quite rare.
In a 2019 study published in the journal American Psychologist, researchers in Britain and the Netherlands reviewed surveillance footage of 200 violent altercations in three countries and found that bystanders had intervened about 90% of the time. In many of the instances, several strangers worked together to calm a fight.
The authors of the study found little variation in the rates of intervention in the three cities — Amsterdam; Cape Town, South Africa; and Lancaster, England — suggesting that the human impulse to help strangers despite risks to one’s own personal safety is universal.
Richard Philpot, lead author of the study, said the uniform rate of interventions was especially surprising given the climate of fear in Cape Town, a city with a comparatively higher rate of violent crime.
“Now that we can examine real-life public conflicts on a large scale, we see that people actually help out a lot,” said Philpot, a social psychologist at Lancaster University. “This is certainly reassuring, to know that others around do not exclusively inhibit helping, but are a resource for good.”
Still, the decision to intervene comes with real risks. Earlier this year, a Chinese immigrant who was reportedly troubled by the spate of attacks on Asian Americans was stabbed to death when he tried to break up a street brawl in Brooklyn. In 2020, a man who intervened in a fight at a Harlem subway station was pushed onto the tracks and killed by a train.
Jackson Katz, co-founder of Mentors in Violence Prevention, an influential program started in 1997 that empowers people to intervene in instances of sexual assault, said fear, not apathy, is the main reason people fail to act when confronted by violence.
“From the outside, it’s easy to look at these people and say, ‘Oh, you’re a coward, you’re apathetic’ or ‘Our culture is so screwed up,’ but the fear of physical retribution can be paralyzing, even if a person is terribly upset by what they are witnessing,” he said. “And it’s a realistic fear, especially in a country where guns are everywhere.”
In a way, that explains some of the tragic testimony heard this past week during the trial for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with killing George Floyd in Minneapolis. Witnesses took the stand to describe their frustration and feelings of helplessness as the officer ignored their pleas while kneeling on Floyd’s neck.
Darnella Frazier, 18, testified that she sometimes lies awake at night, “apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life.”
Fear is not the only factor that determines whether bystanders act in such moments. Bibb Latane, a social psychologist who helped pioneer the field of bystander intervention in the years after the Genovese murder, described another dynamic at play: the diffusion of responsibility that can lead to inaction among strangers who witness a crime.
Latane, along with social psychologist John Darley, sought to replicate real-life emergencies through a series of lab experiments with people who did not know one another. The greater the number of onlookers, they found, the less likely people were to intervene. They also determined that strangers unconsciously took their cues from those around them, a concept known as social influence, and were less likely to intervene when others were similarly passive.
In an interview, Latane said the theories that he and Darley had developed nearly five decades ago were frequently overlooked by those who cling to popular notions of the emotionally detached bystander. He said those sentiments were often fanned by the news media, which tends to publicize incidents in which witnesses failed to act while ignoring instances when onlookers intervened.
“It's the unusual event that makes it newsworthy,” he said. “It was never about apathy, it’s about social inhibition, and I’ve always thought it was unfair that New York was condemned for what happened to Genovese.”
More-recent research that examines real-life interactions has called into question some of their earlier findings. The 2019 study by Philpot, for one, found that a greater number of bystanders increased the prospects for intervention. In reviewing the surveillance footage, the researchers found that on average at least three people chose to act, and they determined that the presence of each additional bystander led to a 10% increase in the odds that a victim would receive help.
Although Philpot said his research was not aimed at testing the bystander-effect theory, the findings suggest that there is safety in numbers.
“While the presence of more bystanders may reduce the likelihood that each single individual intervenes, it also provides a wider pool of potential help givers, thus boosting the overall likelihood that the victim receives help from at least someone,” he said.
Alan Berkowitz, an expert on the bystander effect and author of “Response-Ability: A Complete Guide to Bystander Intervention,” said other factors, including the race of the perpetrator or victim, could play an unconscious role in determining whether people help a stranger in need.
“Research suggests that bystanders who, for instance, are white might not feel it’s worth their while getting involved in an incident involving two people of color, but they might feel more comfortable intervening in a fight between two white male executives,” said Berkowitz, a psychologist who runs workshops for college students, community groups and members of the military about ways to effectively intervene to prevent acts of violence and sexual assault. “Once you train yourself to become aware of these things, and you are trained to do interventions that are safe and effective, you become more comfortable acting on your desire to help.”
Some of those tactics include distracting the perpetrator, calling for help or finding a way to enlist other bystanders to intervene more collaboratively.
“Talking to other bystanders is really important, because often we don’t know that others are also concerned,” he said.
But as in the Genovese case, the initial accounts of a crime — and the responses of bystanders — are often incomplete. And video footage, it turns out, may not always tell the full story. In the case of the recent beating on the subway, the victim, the police later said, was Hispanic, not Asian, and they said he might have instigated the violence with a racial slur. Experts say that filming an attack is also an act of courage that can deter the assailant from inflicting even more grievous harm. It can also serve as an invaluable tool for bringing an assailant to justice.
In the case of the attack on the woman outside the apartment building in Manhattan, the victim’s daughter said someone had tried to help: A passerby yelled at the perpetrator in an attempt to distract him. There were no calls to 911, but the union representing the doormen who were seen watching the attack from inside a lobby — and who then closed the front door once the assailant fled — defended the men, saying the brief clip from the surveillance footage did not show what had come afterward. The men, the union said, went outside to help the woman and flagged down a passing police car.

Full text: The testimony was partly an effort by the prosecution to show that Mr. Floyd had a high tolerance for fentanyl, which could undercut any argument that he died of a drug overdose.
MINNEAPOLIS -- They met one evening four summers ago, and she was instantly drawn to his "great, deep, Southern voice." She gave him her phone number that night, and they became close, exploring the city's sculpture garden and its vibrant restaurant scene. Soon she was simply calling him "Floyd," just like his friends did.
For Courteney Ross, a lifelong resident of Minneapolis, George Floyd made her hometown seem new again, undiscovered.
"Floyd was new to the city, so everything was kind of new to him," Ms. Ross said. "He made it seem like I was new to my own city."
On the fourth day of testimony in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the former officer charged in Mr. Floyd's death, the prosecution presented a fuller picture of George Floyd the person. In testimony, Ms. Ross, who had been dating Mr. Floyd for almost three years, described how he was a caring partner, a devoted father and passionate about exercise -- a guy who loved to ride his bike and play ball with the neighborhood children.
She talked about all these things, as well as the ups and downs of their relationship, his love for his mother and the devastation he felt when she died a few years ago.
And like so many Americans, the couple had a shared struggle: opioid addiction.
"Our story, it's a classic story of how many people get addicted to opioids," she said. "We both struggled from chronic pain. Mine was in my neck and his was in his back."
After three days of emotional testimony from bystanders who witnessed Mr. Floyd's death in police custody last May, prosecutors on Thursday nudged the trial forward to one of the central aspects of the case: Mr. Floyd's drug use.
In calling Ms. Ross to the stand, prosecutors both sought to humanize Mr. Floyd and seize the narrative around his struggle with drugs. By showing he had a high tolerance for opioids, prosecutors hope to cushion the blow of what is expected to be Mr. Chauvin's primary defense -- that Mr. Floyd died from a drug overdose, not from Mr. Chauvin's knee pressing into his neck for more than nine minutes.
Over the nearly three-year, on-and-off relationship between Mr. Floyd and Ms. Ross, there were periods where they were clean, followed by relapse. When they could not obtain prescriptions for opioids from doctors, she said, they bought drugs on the streets.
"Addiction in my opinion is a lifelong struggle," Ms. Ross said, in sometimes halting, tearful testimony. "It's something we dealt with every day. It's not something that just comes and goes."
On Thursday, prosecutors were trying to establish that Mr. Floyd -- who had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system when he died, according to the toxicology report -- had a high tolerance for fentanyl, which would help them rebut the defense's claims that Mr. Floyd died of an overdose.
The defense's focus on Mr. Floyd's drug use, which arose numerous times in pretrial arguments and motions, echoes other high-profile police brutality cases, especially ones like this where police officers are accused of killing Black men.
It is a familiar playbook: In the Rodney King case in Los Angeles in the 1990s, defense lawyers brought up Mr. King's alleged drug use; after Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, officers said Mr. Brown was high on marijuana; and in the trial of an officer in Chicago for the killing of Laquan McDonald, the defense presented testimony about the victim's drug use.
Yet as Mr. Chauvin, who is white, went on trial, one of the primary questions was whether this tactic would still work, especially amid shifting attitudes in America about drug use and with the country in the grips of an opioid epidemic.
"Tens of thousands of Americans struggle with self-medication and opioid abuse and are treated with dignity, respect and support, not brutality," Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, lawyers for the Floyd family, said in a joint statement on Thursday. "We fully expected the defense to put George's character and struggles with addiction on trial because that is the go-to tactic when the facts are not on your side."
Eric J. Nelson, Mr. Chauvin's lawyer, approached his cross-examination of Ms. Ross delicately, and started by saying: "I'm sorry to hear about your struggles with opioid addiction. Thank you for sharing that with the jury."
Ms. Ross told Mr. Nelson that they relapsed together last spring, and that Mr. Floyd was hospitalized for several days in March after she found him doubled over in pain from an overdose. Later that month, she thought they had both managed to quit again, but in the weeks before he died in May, a change in Mr. Floyd's behavior made her think he had again begun using.
"We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times," she said. "When you know someone who suffers from any type of addiction, you can start to kind of see changes when they're using again."
While the questioning of Ms. Ross might have appeared spontaneous and off-the-cuff to jurors and the general public, the trial is well choreographed. All the witnesses are coached and prepared beforehand, sometimes in multiple sessions. Minnesota, in fact, has some of the strictest rules about the sharing of evidence and testimony -- so both the defense and prosecution know well in advance what each side will present in a trial.
Jurors also heard on Thursday from two paramedics who said that Mr. Floyd was in a dire state by the time they arrived on the scene on May 25. Derek Smith, one of the paramedics, said he could not find a pulse when he felt Mr. Floyd's neck as police officers remained on top of him.
"In lay terms, I thought he was dead," Mr. Smith testified. In efforts to get Mr. Floyd's heart beating, paramedics used a device to administer chest compressions and a defibrillator to provide an electric shock, but nothing worked, Mr. Smith said. Mr. Floyd was brought to a hospital where he was officially pronounced dead at 9:25 p.m.
Mr. Smith's testimony could bolster prosecutors' argument that it was Mr. Chauvin's actions that led to Mr. Floyd's death. Mr. Chauvin's lawyer has suggested that the drugs Mr. Floyd had taken may have killed him.
Minutes after Mr. Floyd was taken away in an ambulance, Mr. Chauvin told a supervisor that police officers "had to hold the guy down" because he would not stay in the back of a police car and "was going crazy," according to new body camera footage played in court.
The supervisor, Sgt. David Pleoger, testified that Mr. Chauvin had not mentioned applying pressure to Mr. Floyd's neck until later, when they arrived at a nearby hospital and learned that Mr. Floyd was not doing well. Sergeant Pleoger, who has since retired, said that based on body camera videos from the scene, he thought the police officers should have stopped holding Mr. Floyd down once he became unresponsive.
"When Mr. Floyd was no longer offering up any resistance to the officers, they could have ended their restraint," Sergeant Pleoger said.
In the earlier testimony, Ms. Ross also said that Mr. Floyd referred to her and his own mother, who died in 2018, by the same nickname: "Mama." Mr. Floyd had called out for "Mama" as Mr. Chauvin knelt on his neck before his death.
Mr. Floyd had moved to Minneapolis from Houston looking for a fresh start, but after his mother died, Ms. Ross said, he changed. "He seemed like a shell of himself," she said. "Like he was broken. He seemed so sad. He didn't have the same kind of bounce that he had."
On Thursday, jurors heard not only about Mr. Floyd's struggle with drugs, but also details about his relationship with Ms. Ross.
She first met him at a Salvation Army homeless shelter where Mr. Floyd worked as a security guard. One night, he saw her waiting in the lobby to talk with the father of her two children about the birthday of one of their sons. Mr. Floyd sensed that she was upset.
"He was like, 'Sis, you OK, sis?"' Ms. Ross recounted. He told her she was not OK.
"He said, 'Can I pray with you?"'
"This kind person just to come up to me, and say can I pray with you, when I felt alone in this lobby," she said. "It was so sweet at the time. I had lost faith in God."
