NEW YORK — Historically, most of the state’s poll workers have been older than 60, according to the New York State Board of Elections. It’s a demographic typically vulnerable to the coronavirus. And yet, if the early voting lines are any indication, this year’s presidential election needs poll workers more than ever.
Fortunately, new generations of New Yorkers have stepped up. Their motivations are political, ethical and financial. (It pays pretty well for part-time work.) Here are a few of their stories.
The Front-Liners
Denmore McDermott was inspired to become a poll worker when his colleagues at a software company were brainstorming ways to get involved with the Black Lives Matter movement. His way of helping, he decided, would be to secure a safe voting process.
“Honestly, it just came down to how to make an impact through COVID,” McDermott, 31, said. “I’d rather go in on the front lines and kind of sit there and make sure things are going well for my fellow New York citizens rather than someone else having to take that risk.”
While some first-time poll workers have expressed concern about a new wave of infections, nothing will stop McDermott, he said.
“I’m going to go out there with my mask and my sanitizer and I’m going to see it through,” McDermott said.
For the three years she has lived in Queens, Mallory Woods has had the same poll worker: her downstairs neighbor, Maris.
“I realized that the majority of poll workers I’ve interacted with have been seniors, and that’ll be an issue this year,” she said.
Woods, 31, decided to sign up after reading a comedian’s post on Twitter encouraging young people to volunteer.
“I’m relatively young and able-bodied,” Woods said. “If not me, then who?”
While Woods, a self-proclaimed “political news junkie,” was disgruntled by the opacity of the registration process, she believes that serving as a poll worker is her civic duty.
“It’s a small but very tangible way to know I’m doing something positive in a year that’s been downright cruel,” she said. “I’m absolutely willing to work what sounds like will be a pretty brutal day if it makes the process of voting more pleasant and safe for the folks in my neighborhood.”
The Instagram Activist
At some point this summer, it felt as if everyone in Rebecca Davis’ group text was discussing signing up for poll work, she said.
“Everyone was talking about it in a way I had never seen before,” Davis said.
She probably had a little something to do with that. Davis, 35, runs Rally + Rise, a nonprofit focused on making activism more approachable. In mid-August, Davis posted “6 Things You Can Do Right Now If You’re Worried About the Mail and the Election” to the group’s Instagram account. It quickly became one of their most popular posts, with over 30,000 likes.
Davis hopes that Rally + Rise’s social media feed, with its mix of memes and voter registration details, will make civic engagement a little friendlier.
“If you go to the Board of Elections website, it looks like it’s stuck in 1998,” she said. “For a certain person, they might think it feels too official or overwhelming, and they just might not bother using it,” she continued. “Through our contact, I hope people think, ‘Hey, this can be something that someone like me does.’ ”
The High School Student
For Ashley Reyes , being civically engaged is not just an aspiration; it’s a requirement. That is, if she wants to pass her AP government class.
Soon after her teacher at Dr. Richard Izquierdo Health and Science Charter School in the Bronx mandated that his students find a way to become civically engaged, she found out there was a shortage of poll workers.
“Bingo,” she said.
This is the first election for Reyes, 18. She had long seen her mother vote but had no idea what went on behind the scenes. Now, she is serving as a Spanish-language interpreter at her local polling site.
“Voting and being present is a way for me to be active and know what’s going on around me,” Reyes said. “I want to know as much as possible.”
The Staycationer
Sherri Cohen, 35, said she is dedicating her allotted vacation days to poll work: “Right now I’m kind of like, where else am I going to go?”
Cohen said she wants to make sure that New Yorkers have the opportunity to vote in person. But participating in the election effort also provides a respite from her work-from-home situation.
“I think taking the time for a day or a week to be in another location is exciting to me,” she said. “It really speaks to my desire to get out of the house and feel somewhat more directly useful.”
The gig is also paid — over the course of 10 possible working days, including the general election and early voting, volunteers can earn up to $2,800.
“Who knows what is going on in the country in the next month, the next six months, the next year,” Cohen said. “It just seems wise to make the money where possible.”
For Victoria Maresca, paid days off at her apparel company, where she is an associate buyer, are uncommon.
“This is the first time that my company has given us Election Day off, and I feel like I need to do something good with it, when so much bad is happening right now,” Maresca, 26, said.
The Furloughed Worker With Free Time
A pandemic-induced furlough that cut employment to part time for Laura Hymes has provided the flexibility needed for training and working the polls this year.
“I’m working less hours, and there’s no set schedule, so I can kind of work whenever,” said Hymes, 28, a marketing director for an entertainment company.
She is currently on a shared-work program, a government effort to subsidize lost wages.
Hymes was partly inspired to work the polls by her father, who is also doing it for the first time in Florida. But social media was a major influence, too.
“I feel like there’s more social chatter and awareness this year,” she said.
Recently Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order stating that those receiving unemployment and making less than $504 per week did not have to report income from their election work. Even though Hymes said she was not doing this for the money, she was grateful to hear the news.
“I wanted to be able to get paid for being a poll worker, and I was glad to hear that it wouldn’t mess up my unemployment.”
The Veteran
Nancy Wolfe has worked nearly every election since 2016, but during the primaries in June, she decided that working wasn’t worth exposure to the virus. Wolfe, 35, has rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, and her two roommates are also high-risk.
“The primary wasn’t that big of a deal,” Wolfe said. “Biden already had the nomination.”
But the stakes are higher Nov. 3, Wolfe said, adding that she cannot justify sitting it out this time. The new safety guidelines have comforted her health fears for now. But in a “worst-case scenario,” she said, she is considering getting a rapid coronavirus test before going home to keep her housemates safe.
Wolfe is also concerned that the new corps of young workers won’t bring the experience necessary to run such a high-profile election.
“In my head I really wanted to sit out again, but I’m worried that it will be everybody’s first day on the job,” she said. “It just kind of feels like it’s a pressure cooker, and this is the last chance we have to save democracy or an election, maybe ever.”

Full text: The coronavirus and battered economy are focal points in national campaigns. But in many local elections, systemic racism and police reform have emerged as dominant themes.
[Race affects our lives in countless ways. To read more provocative stories on race from The New York Times, sign up here for our Race/Related newsletter.]
A veteran law enforcement officer in Charleston, S.C., campaigning to unseat her boss has vowed to root out racial bias in the 900-member Sheriff's Department and rebuild trust in the Black community.
A former judge in Iberia Parish, La., who is running for district attorney has promised to change how prosecutors make charging, plea and bail decisions.
And in Hamilton County, Ohio, the race for the top prosecutor pits a Republican incumbent running on a "tough-on-crime" platform against a Democrat and former judge who is pushing to eliminate cash bail for nonviolent offenses and create a conviction integrity unit.
While the coronavirus and battered economy have overtaken issues of race as the focal points in presidential and congressional campaigns, despite the disproportionate impact of both on communities of color, systemic racism and police reform have emerged as dominant themes in a number of local elections. In states across America, from California to Kentucky to New York, many voters said they saw the races for sheriffs, prosecutors and council representatives as having more consequence to their lives.
In South Carolina, Kristin Graziano, a 32-year police veteran, is challenging Sheriff Al Cannon, who has held the Charleston County post since 1988. Ms. Graziano, a Democrat, said she had been thinking about race and policing for years, particularly after the death of Walter Scott, a Black man who was killed by a white North Charleston police officer in 2015.
Ms. Graziano, 53, has centered much of her candidacy on issues of accountability and diversifying the department, which covers a county that is almost one-third Black. If elected, Ms. Graziano, who is white, would be the first woman to serve as a sheriff in the state.
"When unarmed men get shot in the back running away from police and when people get choked out in handcuffs, obviously those are not right," said Ms. Graziano, who began her law enforcement career in Charlottesville, Va. "It's a systemic problem, it's always been a systemic problem. I think it's a very small portion that have the bias, but we have to own it."
Mr. Cannon, who is white, said the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers, which led to thousands of protests across the country this summer and conversations about race and racism, sharpened a collective focus on racial injustices. But, he said, his department was already making progress, including efforts to reduce the county's inmate population.
And about three months ago, Mr. Cannon, 74, said he moved to avoid "flash points," such as directing the force to issue citations rather than make arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana.
Both candidates said they were encouraged by the surge in early voting in Charleston County. As of Thursday, about 76,000 people had voted in person, compared with 43,000 in 2016. And mail-in ballots jumped from 16,000 to 52,000, county records show.
Hoping to harness the energy at demonstrations amid a national conversation about race, organizers pushed massive voter registration drives over the summer. The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of activist groups, hosted a series of virtual town halls and conventions focused on election issues. And local chapters of Black Lives Matter hosted Instagram live chats with candidates to weigh their positions on issues of race and policing.
Rock the Vote, a nonprofit organization aimed at registering young voters, said its platform had surpassed two million registered voters this year, up from 1.7 million in 2016. Since Mr. Floyd's death, Voto Latino, a nonprofit political organization, registered 451,976 voters across the country.
"Following the murder of George Floyd, we saw an explosion in voter registrations," said Danny Turkel, communications manager of Voto Latino, noting that the organization registered 97,000 voters in June alone. He said a July poll showed that three-quarters of Latinos surveyed supported the Black Lives Matter movement and 64 percent said police reform was among their top reasons to vote.
But there is a racial divide over the importance of race in this election season.
In a Pew Research Center survey that interviewed 7,485 registered voters in July and August, at the height of the unrest and the nation's reckoning over systemic racism, 85 percent of Black and 66 percent of Hispanic respondents viewed "race and ethnic inequality" as very important to their vote, compared with 43 percent of white voters.
Still, a growing number of Black and Latino voters support Mr. Trump, despite his refusal to denounce white nationalism and his calls for "law and order" in the wake of some protests that turned violent. A large national poll released on Thursday showed the president winning 9 percent of Black voters this year, up from 8 percent in 2016, and 35 percent of Latino voters, up from 29 percent.
"The stakes, I will say, have never been higher," said Martin Luther King III, the son of the famed civil rights leader. "I think the vast majority of Black Americans -- and really Americans -- believe that we've got to address the issue of race, systematic racism."
In Louisville, Ky., where a protest movement galvanized by the police killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor has persisted for 150 days, the focus has been on changing the makeup of the Louisville Metro Council, which has the power to change police policy and, in June, passed a bill known as Breonna's Law that banned no-knock warrants.
"Folks are paying attention to that and they're connecting it to their ballots, and that is vitally important," Attica Scott, a Kentucky state representative, said. "Until folks really understand how local and state and federal government work, they won't necessarily be the kind of informed voters who can create this change."
Last year, the office of Bo Duhé, the district attorney for Louisiana's 16th Judicial Circuit, made an unusual motion to have Lori Landry, the first Black female judge in the district, removed from more than 300 cases. Mr. Duhé's office argued that Ms. Landry was biased against prosecutors, in part because she accused them of racial bias in their treatment of defendants.
Now Ms. Landry, who left the bench in July, is challenging Mr. Duhé in his re-election bid.
She has centered her campaign on the racial disparities she complained about from the bench, and she said the national conversation on race has only highlighted injustices that have left her more worried than when she was growing up.
"I was never afraid for the safety of my brothers like I'm afraid for the safety of my 21- and 28-year-old nephews," Ms. Landry, 57, said. "It has shaped me as a person. But it also has pushed me in a race that I might not otherwise be in."
Mr. Duhé, who is white, did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. But in interviews with other news outlets he has stressed the need to protect victims and provide alternatives to incarceration for defendants.
For some Black residents of the 16th circuit, which includes Iberia, St. Mary and St. Martin Parishes, the district attorney's race has been a rallying cry for change in a criminal justice system that they have long felt was stacked against them.
Many still feel the sting of the tenure of Louis Ackal, the former Iberia Parish sheriff whose deputies accused him of brutal, racist acts and who was acquitted on charges of federal civil rights abuses. And many local residents see the district attorney's office, which has always been led by white men, as upholding a system that has made Louisiana among the states with the highest incarceration rates, with Black men and boys nine times more likely to be locked up before trial than their white counterparts.
Robby Carrier-Bethel, a community activist in New Iberia, said a lot of new young people are engaging in the political process this year, helping with door-to-door canvassing, phone banking and social media outreach for Ms. Landry. There are some indications that the efforts are moving Black voters toward the polls. Black voter registration is slightly up this year in the 16th circuit compared with four years ago, while registration among white voters has fallen.
Ms. Carrier-Bethel, 60, said the urgency of this election lay in her concern that hard-won racial advancements of generations past could be lost.
"Realizing that actually makes you stop and pause," she said. "You understand fully what's at stake and that you have to be the protector of those rights."

“Folks are paying attention to that and they’re connecting it to their ballots, and that is vitally important,” Attica Scott, a Kentucky state representative, said. “Until folks really understand how local and state and federal government work, they won’t necessarily be the kind of informed voters who can create this change.”
Last year, the office of Bo Duhé, the district attorney for Louisiana’s 16th Judicial Circuit, made an unusual motion to have Lori Landry, the first Black female judge in the district, removed from more than 300 cases. Duhé’s office argued that Landry was biased against prosecutors, in part because she accused them of racial bias in their treatment of defendants.
Now Landry, who left the bench in July, is challenging Duhé in his reelection bid.
She has centered her campaign on the racial disparities she complained about from the bench, and she said the national conversation on race has only highlighted injustices that have left her more worried than when she was growing up.
“I was never afraid for the safety of my brothers like I’m afraid for the safety of my 21- and 28-year-old nephews,” Landry, 57, said. “It has shaped me as a person. But it also has pushed me in a race that I might not otherwise be in.”
Duhé, who is white, did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. But in interviews with other news outlets he has stressed the need to protect victims and provide alternatives to incarceration for defendants.
For some Black residents of the 16th circuit, which includes Iberia, St. Mary and St. Martin Parishes, the district attorney’s race has been a rallying cry for change in a criminal justice system that they have long felt was stacked against them.
Many still feel the sting of the tenure of Louis Ackal, the former Iberia Parish sheriff whose deputies accused him of brutal, racist acts and who was acquitted on charges of federal civil rights abuses. And many local residents see the district attorney’s office, which has always been led by white men, as upholding a system that has made Louisiana among the states with the highest incarceration rates, with Black men and boys nine times more likely to be locked up before trial than their white counterparts.
Robby Carrier-Bethel, a community activist in New Iberia, said a lot of new young people are engaging in the political process this year, helping with door-to-door canvassing, phone banking and social media outreach for Landry. There are some indications that the efforts are moving Black voters toward the polls. Black voter registration is slightly up this year in the 16th circuit compared with four years ago, while registration among white voters has fallen.
Carrier-Bethel, 60, said the urgency of this election lay in her concern that hard-won racial advancements of generations past could be lost.
“Realizing that actually makes you stop and pause,” she said. “You understand fully what’s at stake and that you have to be the protector of those rights.”

‘What a Barrister Looks Like’: A Young Black Woman Paves the Way

LONDON — It was looking like a typical day at the office for Alexandra Wilson as she arrived at a London courthouse ready to defend someone accused of theft.
She tied her hair into a neat knot, shrugged on her black robe and pulled on a white horsehair wig — the official garb of Britain’s barristers, the lawyers who argue most cases in court.
But once she was in the courtroom, things went off script. In a patronizing exchange that was rude at best and hostile at worst, the prosecutor, an older white man, scoffed at Wilson, chided her for speaking with her client and tutted at her requests for details on court documents.
Unfortunately, it was an all too typical day for Wilson in a profession where, as a young Black woman, she often finds herself fighting for recognition and respect.
“It certainly does happen to a lot of Black barristers,” she said after the encounter. “My ability is underestimated, quite a lot.”
Last month, in an incident that made headlines in Britain — and spurred a public apology from the acting head of the country’s court system — Wilson was shouted at for entering the court to defend her client, one of three times that day she was assumed to be a defendant.
Wilson wrote about the encounter in a Twitter thread that soon went viral, and said the incident underscored broader issues in the justice system.
“For me, it was a real insight that Black people are being criminalized from when they are first laid eyes on,” she said. “How can I reassure my clients that it’s a fair system if people are already making their mind up from seeing a Black person that you are likely to be a criminal?”
That is part of her drive to be here.
“I thought the best way to make a difference was to be a part of the system that is so problematic and to make change from the inside,” she said. “It’s one thing calling out all of the problems, but we need to actually think, ‘How are we going to solve this?’”
As the 25-year-old daughter of a Black Caribbean father and white British mother from working-class roots, she is still a rarity in the cavernous halls of England’s courts.
Her unabashed observations about race and class have drawn a following of thousands on Twitter, inspired a book about her experiences and driven her to found a community for Black women in the legal professions. Just over a year into her career, she’s only getting started.
A tweet she posted a few months before becoming a practicing barrister in early 2019 that included a photo of her in her official attire and the note “THIS is what a barrister looks like” was the first to draw attention.
The most recent statistics on diversity among Britain’s barristers, from the Bar Standards Board, the profession’s regulating body in England and Wales, are grim. Nearly 100 years after the first women became barristers in 1922, women account for just 38% of the profession and 16% of the most senior barristers, known as Queen’s Counsel. And Black barristers account for just 3.2% of all barristers and 1.1% of the most senior ones.
A 2018 report from the Bar Standards Board noted that Black prospective barristers encounter significantly higher barriers to entering the profession than their white peers and are less likely to be taken on as trainees.
Yet Black people are overrepresented in the prison population, data from the Justice Ministry shows, with Black people making up about 12% of the prison population but just 3% of the total population in England and Wales.
The result, Wilson noted, is criminal courtrooms where those in positions of authority are overwhelmingly white and defendants are disproportionately Black.
“If you’ve got an overrepresentation of Black people on the wrong side of the law, being pushed through the system,” she said, “and they don’t see any Black people representing them, how can they trust us?”
Wilson confronts the skewed dynamic head on in her book, “In Black and White,” a memoir that details her experience as a barrister and her journey to get there, while unpacking the issues of race and class in a justice system long dominated by rich white men.
She thinks the time is right for Britain to address racial inequality after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis set off protests and a global conversation about race, including in Britain.
“I think we like to think of ourselves as this post-racial society where race doesn’t exist and we all live in racial harmony, and frankly, it’s not true,” she said.
She specialized in criminal and family law practice in the hopes of maximizing the impact she can make, and is a founding member of One Case at a Time, an initiative to fund and provide legal representation for people of color.
“We can’t just fool ourselves into thinking that everyone has the exact same life chances and everyone is on a level playing field, because they are not,” she said.
Wilson grew up the eldest of four children in Essex, an area of southeastern England bordering London. Her father is first-generation British, born in England to Jamaican parents who immigrated to the country with a wave of other workers from the Caribbean as part of the “Windrush Generation.” Her mother came from a British working-class family and grew up in social housing.
Both went on to received their college degrees as adults and are both now teachers, and Wilson credits her own ambition and perseverance to them.
When she was 17, the death of a close friend who was stabbed in London in a case of mistaken identity forced her to take a hard look at the system.
“For me, that was the first time I really started to appreciate how important color was,” she said, “because I had absolutely no doubt if he had been white, he wouldn’t have been killed that day.”
She followed his case through the courts and began to look into other cases, too. After his death, she knew she wanted a career that allowed her to address racial inequities in the justice system.
Yet she had to fight for her place every step of the way. When she told teachers that she wanted to apply to the University Oxford, one told her mother that she was “too ambitious.”
When she graduated from Oxford — after studying in classrooms where she was often the only Black student — and applied for a legal traineeship, peers told her it would be impossible. And when she became a barrister, they said she wouldn’t fit in.
But last year, when she picked up the formal garb of her new profession — her new wig in a tin case with “Alexandra J. Wilson” in gold lettering on the front — with her grandmother by her side, she knew they were wrong.
Now, she wants to lift up other women of color who are making their way into the profession. This year, she founded Black Women in Law, a community for aspiring lawyers and women already in the field. The group has close to 600 members who connect for conversations, advice and mentoring and organizes online events for schools.
“It’s so important that kids see Black female lawyers,” Wilson said. “I didn’t, and I wanted to.”

Dating in the Run-Up to the Election

Rebecca Cibbarelli, 23, was texting with a man on Hinge while Sen. Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence debated on her TV screen in early October. When she told her match what she was watching, he said he didn’t know who either of the people in the debate were, or which political office they were running for.
“We’ve been in a global pandemic for eight months, and there’s been so much social and political change,” said Cibbarelli, a mental health worker in Princeton Junction, New Jersey. “How have you not even taken interest in it when you’re stuck in the house? I was working 60 hours a week, I started school and I’m still keeping up.” Suffice it to say, things didn’t work out.
In a year marked by partisan debates over the coronavirus pandemic, widespread protests for Black Lives Matter and a presidential election, politics is reaching deep into the lives of Americans, affecting not only their families, schools, taxes and health care but also their dating habits.
Some singles want to know if their potential matches are civically engaged, even on a basic level. Others see their dates’ politics as indicators of compatibility.
A few daters expressed frustration about people who “virtue signal” — add phrases like Black Lives Matter to their profiles to show support for a cause — but do not seem to engage with the issues beyond their bios.
“You ask if they were at a protest, and it turns out that they weren’t or they give some sappy excuse for not being there,” said Jorge Clavo Abbass, 23, a graduate student and instructor at Ohio State University.
Data on Daters
In a survey, the dating app Bumble found that out of 50 factors women considered in a potential match, politics ranked ninth. (It came in behind smoking habits, family plans, life goals and relationship intent.) About 33-35% of all users said the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement have made them care more about the political views of their potential match, said Jemma Ahmed, Bumble’s head of insights.
“The conversations we have aren’t just about how our days are going anymore. They’re about unavoidable topics, like police brutality,” said Ashley Mack, 27, an aesthetician and surgery consultant in Sarasota, Florida.
Mack said that inaction in the face of this summer’s protests led her to end some of her platonic relationships. She also reassessed the qualities she looks for in a potential partner. “I’m more aware of things that are deal breakers for me and what I’ll tolerate,” Mack said. “You think long-term. What would they instill in your kid?”
On OkCupid, a dating site known for lengthy questionnaires that help people pin down potential partners, politics has become the most popular category. More than 1.2 million people who use OkCupid said they prefer to date people who share their political views. Women were more likely to say so than men. The platform recently began offering users a “voter badge,” a digital equivalent of an “I Voted” sticker.
People who have been out of the dating pool for a while may see this as a sea change. “For my generation and most generations before me, it was, ‘Do not talk politics until you’re down the path of a relationship,’” said Melissa Hobley, 40, OkCupid’s chief marketing officer. “Now it’s ‘I don’t even want to see you in my lineup of potential people to chat with if your politics on certain issues don’t align with mine, or if you are not a voter.’”
Political Deal Breakers
When Richard Schmitz, 31, a founder of a marketing agency, moved from New York to Scottsdale, Arizona, he said he was screened by a match. “I had a Hinge date who texted me, ‘Good morning, I think we need to get this out of the way,’” he said. She told him that most of her beliefs are very conservative, that she plans to vote for President Donald Trump, and that if her preference offends him, it is best for them not to meet.
Schmitz was pleasantly surprised. “In New York, it’s very normal and common to see a girl who has ‘If you vote Trump swipe left. Liberals only,’” he said. In Manhattan, he found his dating pool limited and turned to Filter Off, a platform that offers virtual speed dating sessions for people with specific interests, like veganism, the ketogenic diet or a political party. After his struggles in New York City, he said the text he received in Scottsdale was “refreshing.”
Living in New York, Pat Cassidy, 27, who works in investment banking, has found that a common deal breaker for potential dates is not necessarily his conservatism but whether he helped elect the current president. “The screening question is, ‘Did you vote for Trump or are you a Trump supporter?' ” he said.
Cassidy finds himself having to explain his politics, which are “right of center.” “Looking back five years, I do not know if I would have tried to explain myself that much pre-Trump,” he said. “I think the political climate generally has made me feel the need to be a bit more nuanced or tactical about how I position myself.”
As a proud Trump voter in New York City, Sam Baron, 31, who works in tech development, said he does not care about his dates’ politics, but they seem to care about his. “I dated a liberal once,” he said. “When she saw online that I loved Trump, she went way off the deep end on me.”
Recently, Jessica Zimmerman, 42, who owns a group practice for mental health counseling, has been rejecting men who do not see eye-to-eye with her on certain issues, like the separation of migrant children from their families at the U.S. border.
“I’m a single mom and a business owner,” Zimmerman said. “I’m busy, and I hold my time somewhat sacred. I wouldn’t go on a date with someone who thinks that’s a policy we should uphold.”
Her political views have made dating a challenge in Indiana, a state Trump won easily in 2016. “I’m probably the minority where I live,” Zimmerman said. “In the past it didn’t profoundly affect dating. But the extreme divisiveness and the extreme policies have really brought a spotlight on politics.”
Finding Common Ground
Janine Owens, 38, who lives near Philadelphia and works in finance, will not categorically refuse to date someone based on their politics; though she is a registered Democrat, she does not always agree with the party’s policies. But early on, she will inquire how engaged her date is in local and national politics.
“Growing up, there were those unwritten rules of a first date,” she said. “Years ago I probably wouldn’t have brought up politics. Now, we’re definitely bringing it up in the first few weeks of dating.”
The pandemic, with its various pressures and the blue-versus-red debate around its management, has only sharpened existing political divisions.
“The pandemic has really impacted the way I date,” said Ann Nguyen, 25, who works in communications in Washington, D.C. “I’ve spent more time just talking to people.”
And what else is there to talk about? As Sarah Bettman, 31, who works in biotech in Santa Monica, California, put it, the pandemic “has to come up to a certain extent. When you’re talking about your day-to-day and your perspective on it, the politics and how it’s handled are an inevitable part of the conversation.”
Those conversations can make or break an early-stages relationship. “Dating during COVID, I’m putting myself at risk,” Cibbarelli said. “If we’re not in agreement to some extent, I’m not interested in breathing your air.”
For Elly Shariat, 38, a publicist in D.C. whose father and sister work at a hospital, the coronavirus has been a lightning rod in dating. “If I match with you and I see that you’re posting about attending an anti-mask rally, or you post something about masks being harmful and saying that we need to open up sports, that’s not just wrong and factually inaccurate,” Shariat said. “It’s a sign that someone is selfish. That lets me know that you won’t be giving in our relationship.”
Shariat, who did not take the role of politics in her dating life seriously before 2016, said she now leads with her values in her online profiles. “I’ve worked on Capitol Hill,” her bio reads. “I believe Black Lives Matter. I believe COVID-19 is real. And if you disagree with any of those we’re not a good match.”
She said some men have taken that as an invitation to troll her. “This guy told me that my own father and sister were lying to me about cases in the hospital,” Shariat said. “He said they must be getting money from big pharma.” When she told him that she did not think they were a good fit, he responded that she would never find love. Recently Shariat has been asking herself: “Do I take a pause until after this election? Do I move to another country to date?”
Nonetheless, she has no intention of hiding her opinions, nor of compromising her views. “I’m not necessarily looking for someone who mimics my beliefs,” she said. “But if you’re not actively speaking out against things going wrong and not working to make this world better, I don’t even want to have a drink with you.”

What We Know About the Death of Walter Wallace Jr. in Philadelphia

On Monday afternoon, two Philadelphia police officers fatally shot Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man who was armed with a knife. In the nights that followed, protesters clashed with officers in the streets, and city officials imposed a curfew to try to curb the unrest.
The protests in Philadelphia were the latest in a series of demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality that have played out across the country since the spring. Millions have taken to the streets since the killing of George Floyd in police custody in May touched off a national outcry.
The shooting was captured on video.
In an encounter that was captured in a video that circulated on social media, Wallace, holding a knife, walked toward the officers, who quickly moved backward and aimed their guns at him. In the video, someone yells repeatedly at Wallace to “put the knife down.” The camera points toward the ground as about a dozen shots are heard. After Wallace falls to the ground, his mother screams and rushes to his body.
Wallace’s father, Walter Wallace Sr., said his son had struggled with mental health issues and was on medication, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. “Why didn’t they use a Taser?” he said. “His mother was trying to defuse the situation.”
Protesters clashed with police.
For several nights after the shooting, hundreds of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against what they saw as the excessive use of force by police against people of color.
Nearly a dozen miles from where crowds were protesting Wednesday night, businesses including a Walmart, a Lowe’s and a Five Below were looted.
From Monday night through Thursday, 57 officers were injured in clashes with protesters, and 212 people were arrested on charges including assault on police and burglary, authorities said.
Since the death of Floyd in Minneapolis and the national outcry that followed, officials in Philadelphia have made some changes to make police more accountable.
In June, they announced a moratorium on the use of tear gas and apologized for the response to a June protest after a New York Times visual investigation showed SWAT officers using tear gas and pepper spray on nonviolent protesters, some of whom were trapped as they tried to leave the highway where they were demonstrating. On Thursday, the City Council approved a ban on the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on protesters who are exercising their First Amendment rights.
The presidential candidates weighed in.
The shooting and its aftermath, which came days before the election in a swing state, reignited tensions in a country that was already on edge. The responses from President Donald Trump and Joe Biden, his opponent, underscored the deep divisions in the United States.
At a campaign rally in Wisconsin a day after the shooting, Trump said Philadelphia had been torn up by left-wing radicals. “Biden stands with the rioters, and I stand with the heroes of law enforcement,” he said, to cheers. “Just let them do their job.”
Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, condemned the looting in a joint statement but said that nothing would be solved with a president who fanned “the flames of division in our society.”
City officials promised transparency as they investigated.
Sgt. Eric Gripp, a spokesman for the Police Department, said in a statement that investigators were reviewing footage of the shooting and said that both officers were wearing body cameras. The police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw, said she would release the footage from the body cameras and recordings of the 911 calls, according to The Inquirer.
Several City Council members said they would introduce legislation banning police stops for motor-vehicle code violations, including for broken taillights or failure to come to a complete stop at stop signs, The Inquirer reported.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Family and friends of Aaron Pryor say they may never know exactly why the 16-year-old star football player, a lightning-fast running back, was killed in broad daylight on a Sunday in September in a driveway near his Oakland, California, home. Video of the shooting viewed by family members shows an assailant, who has not been arrested, confronting the baby-faced teenager before firing more than a dozen rounds.
But his football coach, Joe Bates, does not hesitate in assigning blame. With school entirely online and football season canceled, the coronavirus shattered the young man’s life, Bates said. The mandatory 7 a.m. study halls for the team’s players, the daily three-hour practices, the Friday games that last late into the night — all of that was gone this fall. In a normal year, Pryor would have been on the field, not on the streets, the coach said.
“It was COVID that really killed this kid,” he said.
Like many U.S. cities, where economies have been ravaged by the pandemic, Oakland has seen a surge in gun violence, including six killings of juveniles since June and a 40% increase in homicides overall. To the south, in Los Angeles, the picture is equally bloody, with the city on pace to have more than 300 homicides for the first time since 2009.
Beyond California, major cities from Minneapolis to Milwaukee to New York and even smaller communities like Lubbock, Texas, and Lexington, Kentucky, are all confronting the same grim pattern, with some places, like Kansas City, Missouri, and Indianapolis, setting records for the number of killings in a single year. Philadelphia, which was gripped by unrest this week after the police shooting of a Black man, is among the cities with the highest increase in homicides; its 404 killings this year are a more than 40% increase compared with the same period last year.
Criminologists studying the rise in the murder rate point to the effects the pandemic has had on everything from mental health to policing in a time of social distancing, with fewer officers able to perform the up-close-and-personal community outreach work that in normal times has helped mitigate violence. Experts also attribute the rise to increased gang violence and a spike in gun ownership, including among many first-time gun owners.
The epidemic of murder in America looms over the final days of a polarizing election campaign that President Donald Trump has sought to frame as a referendum on law and order. His refrain has been constant: that cities run by Democrats have let crime get out of control.
But the data shows that the waves of killings have afflicted Democratic- and Republican-run cities alike.
“The increase has had nothing to do with the political affiliation of your mayor,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.
Rosenfeld has studied crime trends during the pandemic for the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan research organization, and found that homicides increased an average of 53% across 20 major U.S. cities during the summer.
Jeff Asher, a crime analyst in New Orleans, said the rise in killings was hitting all corners of the country. He pointed out several Republican-led cities that have seen sharp upticks: Lubbock, Texas, which has seen 22 homicides, compared with nine in the same period last year; Lexington, Kentucky, where homicides are up 40%; and Miami, where homicides have risen nearly 30%.
“Because the stresses of the pandemic are everywhere, you are seeing this everywhere,” he said. (Asher has published some of his research in The New York Times.)
In Oakland, shootings are so common — and often involve dozens of rounds of ammunition sprayed down city blocks — that both the head of Oakland’s police union and the city’s interim police chief have compared it to a war zone.
For Guillermo Cespedes, chief of the city’s Violence Prevention Department, Oakland now brings to mind another fraught region of the world: Honduras, El Salvador and other countries where gang violence is endemic.
“Right before Oakland I was working in Central America,” Cespedes said. “And this feels more difficult.”
“I’ve been in this field 42 years, and I’ve never lived through something like this,” he said.
Many of the tools that Cespedes has deployed in his career, including meeting with victims’ families, comforting them and, crucially, trying to prevent retaliatory killings, have been dulled by the pandemic.
“There is no way you can Zoom with that family,” he said. “They have to see your eyes. They have to feel your heart. They have to feel who you are, and you have to feel who you are.”
Cespedes said he was working to understand why many of the same areas hit hardest by the coronavirus in Alameda County, which includes Oakland, were also seeing the highest levels of violence.
A study published this month by researchers at the University of California, Davis, estimated that 110,000 people in California bought guns this year because they were worried about the destabilizing effects of the pandemic. The number, based on a survey conducted over the summer, appears to be corroborated by the surge of firearm background checks this year — about 95,000 more than last year. And those are only the guns obtained through legal channels. Los Angeles has seen a 45% increase this year in the number of guns stolen from cars, some of which have later turned up in shootings.
At a recent virtual meeting of the Police Commission, Michel Moore, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, spoke about the “erosion” of the successes the city had reducing gun violence in recent years. He said homicides in central and south Los Angeles were up roughly 50%.
“We see a phenomena of more guns, more people carrying guns and disputes escalating into gun violence,” he told the commission.
He said the department was still analyzing the data to determine why there have been so many homicides, but he noted that it was a trend line across America, and likely exacerbated by the pandemic, which has affected community programs that have been credited with helping young people stay away from crime.
“These are particularly high-stress times,” said Nicole Kravitz-Wirtz, the lead author of the University of California study. “When you add a firearm into those situations it adds particularly fatal risk.”
Kravitz-Wirtz’s study says that by aggravating “poverty, unemployment, lack of resources, isolation, hopelessness and loss” the pandemic has “worsened many of the underlying conditions contributing to violence.”
Aside from the destabilizing effects of the pandemic, the widespread public criticism of the police that followed the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis may have had an impact on the rise in violent crime, Rosenfeld said.
He noted that after the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, following the police shooting of Michael Brown, homicides similarly increased in U.S. cities. Some analysts have called this the “Ferguson effect” and have offered two explanations that may help explain the current rise in homicides: that police have pulled back from patrolling some neighborhoods and that residents, particularly in communities of color, stopped turning to the police out of a lack of trust, leading to more disputes being settled violently.
His research found that other categories of crime, such as residential burglaries, larceny and drug offenses, have declined during the pandemic.
In California and many other parts of the country, the surge in firepower has been a big part of the story, too. The state’s relatively strict gun laws limit the carrying of firearms in public and ban assault weapons, among many other restrictions. Those laws are circumvented by bringing in guns from neighboring states with more permissive gun laws.
Police officers in Oakland this year have seized 1,000 illegal weapons, a 37% increase from last year. Through a partnership with federal authorities, the police department has traced many of these weapons to Utah, Nevada and Colorado.
Police have also seized illegal drums of ammunition that can fire as many as 100 rounds.
“The story is not just who’s getting killed and who’s getting shot; it’s the amount of amazing gunfire out there,” said Oakland’s interim police chief, Susan E. Manheimer.
Buildings and cars have been sprayed with bullets. Two rounds hit the home of one of the city’s police commissioners and pierced the dining rooms of families as they ate, Manheimer said. And police officers have witnessed shootouts where dozens of rounds were fired. “I mean running gunbattles,” she said.
At Pryor’s funeral, held at a beige-peach stucco church on a hot Saturday afternoon, a pastor, Mustafa Muhyee, spoke of the boy’s athletic promise and his leadership.
“When you have to bury your children, you are burying your future,” he said.
The boy’s father, Taijuan Pryor, was hysterical with grief, sobbing as his friends and brother helped him walk to the church courtyard.
He collected himself and stood before his son’s teammates. Would they survive their teenage years, he asked them. Would they live to be 40?
“This is from my heart,” Pryor said. “Put those guns down.”

To Do Politics or Not Do Politics? Tech Startups Are Divided

Rob Rhinehart, a co-founder of nutritional drink startup Soylent, declared in a blog post last week that he was supporting Kanye West for president.
“I am so sick of politics,” Rhinehart wrote. “Politics are suddenly everywhere. I cannot avoid them.”
David Barrett, chief executive of Expensify, a business software startup, went in another direction. In an email to his company’s 10 million customers last week, he implored them to embrace politics by choosing the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden.
“Anything less than a vote for Biden is a vote against democracy,” Barrett proclaimed.
With days to go before the election Tuesday, Rhinehart and Barrett represent the twin poles of a startup culture war that has openly erupted in Silicon Valley. Startups such as the cryptocurrency company Coinbase and the audio app Clubhouse have become embroiled in a debate over how much politics should be part of the workplace. And venture capitalists and other tech executives have weighed in on social media with their own views.
“I have never seen another instance like this in my career,” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and political consultant. “There’s no real separation anymore, in the current political climate, between politics and everything else. It has permeated absolutely everything.”
Silicon Valley tech workers have long been regarded as liberal but not politically overactive. After President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016, however, workers at large tech companies such as Google and Amazon began agitating more on issues like the ethics of artificial intelligence, immigration and climate change.
Now many startup workers, who have been sold on a mission of changing the world, expect their employers to support their social and political causes, entrepreneurs and investors said. This summer’s protests against police violence prompted many tech companies to reexamine their own issues with race. And the pressure to make political moves before the election has only intensified.
The shift has grown partly out of a realization that no tech platform is completely neutral, said Katie Jacobs Stanton, who invests in startups through her venture capital firm, Moxxie Ventures. Founders who build companies with millions of users “really have an obligation to have a point of view and make sure their products are being used for good,” Stanton said.
“It’s disingenuous, and it’s also the luxury of the privileged to say, ‘We don’t have a point of view,’” she added.
But others said they feared becoming a lightning rod or inflaming tensions at a hypersensitive moment during the coronavirus pandemic. Some worried that their companies could be sued by employees who might say they were discriminated against because of their political beliefs. Others said any move could be attacked by those who found the actions inauthentic or not enough.
Those tensions exploded in public last month when Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase, penned a 2,000-word blog post to “clarify” his company’s culture. Armstrong wrote that he wanted Coinbase to generally avoid engaging with broader social issues and workplace conversations about politics. He said it was a way to minimize distraction and focus on the startup’s mission of creating “an open financial system for the world.”
Two months earlier, dozens of Coinbase employees had staged a walkout after executives were slow to express solidarity with Black Lives Matter protesters and minority employees, several workers said. In his post, Armstrong said employees who disagreed with his “no politics” stance could leave.
His position immediately created waves across Silicon Valley. Some praised the move, with one Coinbase investor comparing Armstrong to Michael “Jordan in his prime.” Others said opting out of politics was itself a political statement.
Dick Costolo, a former chief executive of Twitter, tweeted that “me-first capitalists who think you can separate society from business” would be shot in “the revolution.” He deleted the post after, he said, it set off violent threats and harassment.
In an interview, Costolo said it was impossible for companies to separate their mission from their effect on the world. “If you try to separate the social contract from the economic contract, don’t be surprised when there’s an uprising, because they’re linked,” he said.
Some Coinbase workers disagreed with Armstrong. “I’m just so mystified by the apparent lack of awareness in the blog post,” Ryan King, a Coinbase engineer, wrote on the company’s internal Slack messaging system. The message was reviewed by The New York Times. “A declaration that we’re not going to touch ‘broader societal issues’ fails to acknowledge that we’re a part of society.”
About 60 Coinbase employees, or 5% of the workforce, have resigned, the company said. A spokesperson declined further comment.
Fred Wilson, an investor at Union Square Ventures and a Coinbase board member, said in an interview that there were no easy answers for startup leaders. “Many, many CEOs have told me privately that they would like to have done what Brian did but don’t want to take the heat that he has taken,” he said.
On Monday, Wilson wrote a blog post about removing startup chief executives who have “failed to manage numerous important challenges.” The post prompted speculation that he was referring to Armstrong, but Wilson said it was a metaphor for Trump.
The political debates among Silicon Valley startups have ramped up since the Coinbase episode. Last week, Soylent’s Rhinehart published his post supporting West’s presidential bid. Rhinehart, who is on the board but not involved in the company’s day-to-day operations, also attacked the political system and the media, writing that “politics has always been based on jokes.”
Demir Vangelov, Soylent’s chief executive, said Rhinehart’s post did not represent the company. Soylent’s focus is on bringing “the best complete nutrition to everyone,” he said, and it does not take political stances.
At Expensify, based in Portland, Oregon, Barrett took a different position. After spending more than a decade in Silicon Valley, where he found a “uniform view” that politics was not good for business, he moved to Portland four years ago. Now, he said, “choosing not to participate is also a choice — it’s a choice to defend the status quo.”
So when Expensify employees drafted an email to tell customers to vote for Biden, after concluding in an internal discussion that reelecting Trump would be a threat to democracy, Barrett favored sending it out. While roughly a third of Expensify’s top management opposed sending the email because it could alienate customers, the majority ruled, Barrett said.
Last Thursday, Expensify blasted its message to its 10 million users. “Not many expense reports get filed during a civil war,” Barrett wrote.
The email instantly drew criticism and praise on social media. Job applications, web traffic and customer sign-ups have since spiked, Mr. Barrett said. But he also received death threats, prompting him to hire private security. No customers have quit, potentially because Expensify’s system takes months to switch out of, he said.
Tayo Oviosu, chief executive of Paga, a payments startup in Lagos, Nigeria, said Expensify’s email had crossed a line. Oviosu isn’t opposed to companies’ speaking up on social justice issues, “but that is very different than leveraging the fact that you used my personal information to tell me I have to vote in a certain way,” he said. “That is wrong.”
Oviosu, who was using a trial version of Expensify and was considering adopting the paid version, said he now planned to look at alternatives. “I think they lost me completely on this,” he said.
The startup culture wars are also evident on Clubhouse, where people join rooms and chat with one another. The app has been a popular place for investors such as Marc Andreessen and other techies to hang out in the pandemic. (Andreessen’s venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested in Clubhouse, Coinbase and Soylent.)
On Oct. 6, Andreessen started a Clubhouse room called “Holding Space for Karens,” which describes having empathy for “Karens,” a slang term for a pushy privileged woman. Another group, “Holding Space for Marc Andreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessen,” soon popped up. There, people discussed their disappointment with the Karen discussion and other instances when, they said, Clubhouse was hostile to people of color.
Andreessen and others later started a Clubhouse room called “Silence,” where no one spoke. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.
At a “town hall” inside the app on Sunday, Clubhouse’s founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, were asked about Coinbase’s and Expensify’s political statements and where Clubhouse stood. They said the company was still deciding how Clubhouse would publicly back social causes and felt the platform should allow for multiple points of view, a spokeswoman said. She declined to comment further.
Yet even those wishing to stay out of politics are finding it hard to avoid. On Saturday, Armstrong shared Rhinehart’s blog post endorsing West on Twitter. “Epic,” tweeted Armstrong.
Several users pointed out the hypocrisy in Armstrong’s sharing something political after telling employees to abstain. One of his employees, Jesse Pollak, wrote that Armstrong had shared something with “a large number of inaccuracies, conspiracy theories, and misplaced assumptions.”
Soon after, Pollak and Armstrong deleted their tweets.

PHILADELPHIA — Protesters looted stores and scuffled with police late Tuesday in a second night of street protests over the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man, during a confrontation more than 24 hours earlier.
Local television and news websites showed looters entering stores in the Port Richmond neighborhood, northeast of the city center, while officers struggled with protesters in the heart of West Philadelphia, where Wallace was killed Monday afternoon after approaching police officers with a knife.
The victim’s father, Walter Wallace Sr., urged looters to stop. “It will leave a bad scar on my son, with all this looting and chaos,” Wallace said in an interview on CNN. “This is where we live, and it’s the only community resource we have, and if we take all the resource and burn it down, we don’t have anything.”
Danielle Outlaw, the police commissioner, told reporters Tuesday afternoon that she would release information about the shooting within the next few days but that she did not know whether it would include body camera footage from the officers who shot Wallace.
“It’s common for officers to respond to domestic disturbance or any type of call with a gun because it’s one of the tools we carry on our tool belt,” said Outlaw, who added that the officers were not carrying stun guns.
The protests in Philadelphia are the latest in a series of nationwide demonstrations demanding justice after the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, among others.
In addition to signs and chants, some of the rallies from New York to Portland, Oregon, have included looting, arson and destruction of police vehicles. Officers have aggressively targeted protesters at times, firing tear gas and striking them with batons.
In a joint statement Tuesday, former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, sought to validate protesters’ anger over the death of Wallace while discouraging violence and attacks on the police.
“We cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death,” Biden and Harris said. But, they added: “Looting is not a protest, it is a crime. It draws attention away from the real tragedy of a life cut short.”
Thirty officers were injured Monday as protesters threw bricks and rocks at them, a police spokesman said, adding that one officer had a broken leg after being struck by a pickup truck. The Pennsylvania National Guard was expected to send hundreds of people to Philadelphia within the next few days, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Demonstrators gathered in response to the death of Wallace. In a video posted on social media, shouts of “Back up!” and “Put the knife down!” can be heard he walks toward two officers before collapsing in a flurry of gunshots. A woman wails as more officers arrive.
“Bro, they just killed him in front of me,” a man can be heard saying in the video. “Y’all ain’t have to give him that many shots.”
Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement on Monday night that he had spoken with Wallace’s family and that a full investigation of the shooting would be conducted.
“I have watched the video of this tragic incident,” he said, “and it presents difficult questions that must be answered.”

Full text: The project from a group called the George Floyd Justice Billboard Committee features a painting by Donald Perlis and a quote from the Dalai Lama.
A billboard depicting the death of George Floyd went up in Times Square on Tuesday, placed there by a group called the George Floyd Justice Billboard Committee that hopes to expand with more billboards across the country.
With "FLOYD," a painting by Donald Perlis, above a quote from the Dalai Lama, the 26-by-24-foot billboard at Seventh Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets is meant to spark discussions about human rights, regardless of how jarring the scene may be, Corinne Basabe, the chairwoman of the committee, said in an interview.
"We wouldn't have the movement that we have today if that video wasn't so graphic," Ms. Basabe said, referring to this year's Black Lives Matter protests, which began after a bystander video of Mr. Floyd's death surfaced, showing a white police officer handcuffing and pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground with his knee. That officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with second-degree murder, and three other officers involved were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.
The billboard's placement is somewhat symbolic, as Times Square has been virtually empty since March, but it is joining others that are filling empty advertising spaces in different U.S. cities: some, aimed at lawmakers, are calling for reparations using the hashtag #cutthecheck. The artist Carrie Mae Weems recently installed a new project called "RESIST COVID TAKE 6!" on billboards and posters around the country, in a message about social distancing.
"You can't control a billboard," Ms. Basabe said. "You can't turn it off; you can't turn the page. It's going to be in your face as you walk down the block."
Ms. Basabe reached out to Mr. Perlis about the project when she saw his painting this summer at the Green Kill performance space in Kingston, N.Y. "FLOYD" will now be on display at the Salomon Arts Gallery in Manhattan.
Mr. Perlis, a white New York-based artist, often depicts civil unrest, with works focusing on topics like the death of Michael Griffith at Howard Beach, the Central Park Five and the #MeToo movement.
"I'm aware of the legitimate concern and anxiety about cultural appropriation, but I feel this is a general human concern and should be a concern for all Americans," Mr. Perlis said. "It's American history."
As he condensed the video of Mr. Floyd's death into a single image, Mr. Perlis said that he hoped his intention would prevent the painting from seeming too lurid.
"The paintings of the Christian martyrs are devastating, and the paintings of the crucifixion are devastating, and they're necessary in order to make people think about human cruelty," Mr. Perlis said, "and they're portraying human cruelty as a call for human compassion."
Both Ms. Basabe and Mr. Perlis acknowledged the sensitivity surrounding who is sharing and creating depictions of Mr. Floyd, but Ms. Basabe, who is Black, said that when she selected Mr. Perlis's painting, his race never crossed her mind as an issue.
"The job of artists is to expose what's going on in society," Ms. Basabe said. "Whether you're white or Black, if you're doing that, you're doing what you're supposed to do as an artist."
Despite the public debate around sharing images of Black death, Ms. Basabe felt compelled to put the billboard in Times Square, where it will remain for three weeks.
"I want white people dealing with America's past -- it's a two-way street; it's a relationship," Ms. Basabe said. "Black people are not putting police violence against ourselves."
"It's an all-hands-on-deck situation when you're talking about human rights or injustice in the world," she added.

NEW YORK — Political tensions over the upcoming presidential election escalated on New York City’s streets Sunday, as supporters of President Donald Trump clashed with counterprotesters during a day of demonstrations.
Eleven people were arrested, police said, during skirmishes between opposing sides in Manhattan, where Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer and the city’s former mayor, encountered protesters targeting a caravan of cars organized by a group that identifies itself as Jews for Trump. All have been released except for a 36-year-old man who threw eggs in the faces of two police officers, police said.
In one video, Giuliani could be seen in the passenger side of a vehicle with the window rolled down as anti-Trump protesters screamed at him.
In an interview, Giuliani said that he had encountered the caravan and the protesters while driving down Fifth Avenue after taping his radio show.
“I would love to have had a campaign commercial of it and put it on in the middle of America and say, ‘Who would you prefer for the next four years?” he said. “This group of foul-mouthed people who don’t seem to have a vocabulary beyond three words, or these very nice Jewish people who are driving in the car and not saying anything back and not doing anything other than exercising their right to say they’re for Donald Trump.”
According to the police, the pro-Trump caravan passed through Times Square, where it converged with a group of anti-Trump protesters who had marched from Brooklyn. The cars in the convoy were then blocked by counterprotesters, and some drivers got out of their cars to confront the anti-Trump demonstrators.
The two sides hurled political slurs — calling each other “fascists” and “anarchists”— traded blows, and fought over the Trump supporters’ flags before police broke them apart, according to videos posted online.
In some videos, a group of people can be seen yelling expletives and throwing eggs and other projectiles at passing cars flying pro-Trump flags in midtown, while in another, a group of people holding pro-Trump banners march on one side of the street as people across the street yell, “New York hates you.”
The clashes came as the Police Department was preparing for more possible unrest as Election Day approached, including days or weeks of protests in the aftermath of the vote. Hundreds of police officers have been assigned to polling stations for both early voting and Election Day, with thousands more on standby for protests.
Top police officials have stressed the need for officers to remain neutral, despite their unions’ open embrace of Trump. But officials said an officer crossed the line late Saturday, when he used a police loudspeaker to voice support for the president while arguing with a man on the street in Flatbush, Brooklyn, who called him a “fascist.”
“Trump 2020,” the officer responded. “Put it on YouTube. Put it on Facebook. Trump 2020.”
The officer, whose name the police withheld, was suspended without pay Sunday after videos of the incident went viral on social media. Department policy prohibits officers from engaging in political activity on duty or in uniform, including endorsing a candidate or party.
“One hundred percent unacceptable. Period,” Commissioner Dermot F. Shea commented on one of the videos of the suspended officer on Twitter. “Law Enforcement must remain apolitical, it is essential in our role to serve ALL New Yorkers regardless of any political beliefs. It is essential for New Yorkers to trust their Police.”
The Police Benevolent Association, the officer’s labor union, declined to comment.
It is unclear whether two other officers who were with the suspended officer will face discipline.
His suspension is the beginning of a disciplinary process that can take months or even years to play out. But Mayor Bill de Blasio promised quick action.
“ANY NYPD Officer pushing ANY political agenda while on duty will face consequences,” he wrote on Twitter. “We will act fast here, and this will not be tolerated.”
State Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, expressed concern over the incident, noting that police officers transport ballots from poll sites to the Board of Elections.
“There must be swift consequences and protections against election interference,” he said.
Despite the directives from the top, the city’s biggest police unions have heartily embraced Trump, whose law and order message resonates with those who feel Democrats have made the city too soft on crime. Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, endorsed the president in a speech before the Republican National Convention. Ed Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, has appeared at the White House and regularly praises Trump in his official messages to officers.
The demonstrators detained in Times Square on Sunday afternoon, five men and two women, were expected to be charged with disorderly conduct, police said. Investigators were also looking for at least two people seen throwing projectiles at a pro-Trump caravan as it traveled on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.
The caravan, organized by Orthodox Jewish leaders, consisted of dozens of cars and trucks whose participants rode from Brooklyn to Manhattan’s Upper East Side on Sunday. Drivers honked their horns and passengers waved American flags.

As China Clamps Down, Activists Flee Hong Kong for Refuge in the West

HONG KONG — In Western democracies, they have been welcomed as refugees escaping Beijing’s tightening grip over Hong Kong.
In China, they have been denounced as violent criminals escaping punishment for their seditious activities.
A group of Hong Kong activists who have been granted asylum in the United States, Canada and Germany in recent weeks are the latest catalyst for deteriorating relations between China and the West. Western leaders have asserted that they will stand up for human rights in Hong Kong, while Chinese officials have rebuked the countries for what they called interference in Beijing’s affairs.
The protesters’ newly conferred status has made clear how profoundly Hong Kong has changed since China imposed a tough new security law this summer. For decades, the city had been a place of shelter for people escaping war, famine and political oppression in mainland China. Now the semiautonomous city has become a source of asylum seekers.
“The United States is a country that allows us freedom,” said Vicky Xiao, a 20-year-old university student from Hong Kong who is in California and seeking asylum in America.
Xiao said she feared being arrested if she returned to Hong Kong because she had taken part in the demonstrations that roiled the city last year. One of her former classmates who had also joined in the demonstrations in Hong Kong had been detained by the police, she said.
The United States is directly challenging Beijing over its crackdown on Hong Kong. The Trump administration moved to list refugees from the city as a priority for the first time — even as it reduced the total number of refugees the United States will take in annually. At least three bills now before Congress would enact greater protections for people fleeing Hong Kong for the United States. And the government has moved unusually quickly to grant asylum to at least two protesters who left Hong Kong late last year.
The two activists, who asked not to be named to protect their families in Hong Kong, showed The New York Times documents stating they had received asylum in September. They said they had fled to the Los Angeles area after receiving multiple calls from an unlisted number that made them concerned they were at risk of being detained.
Xiao, the university student who is awaiting a decision on her asylum application, is also in Southern California. She is currently on a student visa and lives with her parents, who are on business visas.
She described sneaking out of her parents’ house with a backpack of clothes last August and flying to Hong Kong to join the protests without their approval. She said she returned after three days, but has also helped organize protests in the United States, which she thinks could put her at risk of arrest if she had to return to Hong Kong after her visa expires.
“I don’t know what will happen to me if I go back to Hong Kong,” Xiao said. “But I don’t think that the consequences will be good.”
China has not commented on the U.S. asylum cases. But Beijing and the Hong Kong government have dismissed the notion that the city’s residents might need shelter from oppression, saying the authorities guarantee the rights of its people. “There are no so-called ‘refugees being persecuted’ in Hong Kong,” the city government said in a statement.
And officials have lashed out publicly at other countries. Hong Kong’s No. 2 leader, Matthew Cheung, summoned Germany’s consul general on Wednesday to complain after Germany granted asylum to a university student who was wanted on a rioting charge. Cheung said the move would “only send a plainly wrong message to criminals.”
In Canada, China’s ambassador, Cong Peiwu, warned Ottawa against accepting refugees from Hong Kong. He said such a policy would embolden criminals in the Chinese city and put “the good health and safety” of 300,000 Canadian passport holders and companies in the territory at risk.
The ambassador’s remarks were regarded by some as a potential threat against Canadians in Hong Kong. They were also a reminder of the two Canadians who have been held for nearly two years in China in retaliation for the arrest of a top executive of Huawei, the Chinese technology giant. Canada’s foreign affairs minister, François-Philippe Champagne, denounced the comments as “totally unacceptable and disturbing.” (The Chinese government later asserted that the remarks had been taken out of context.)
China’s crackdown over Hong Kong has prompted residents with means to consider their options elsewhere. Some have turned to Britain, Hong Kong’s former colonial master, which has expanded channels for the city’s residents to immigrate.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in June that the country would allow holders of British overseas passports in Hong Kong to live and work in Britain for up to five years and later apply for citizenship. The residency plan is open to nearly 3 million people in total.
China has criticized the plan. A foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said Friday that Beijing is now considering not recognizing the British overseas passport as a valid travel document.
Interest in the passports has grown, with the number of overseas passport holders more than doubling to over 357,000 in April from about 170,000 in 2018. Such passports, which were given to Hong Kong residents before the territory was returned to China in 1997, bear the insignia of the British government but do not confer the rights of citizenship.
Derek Yeung, 60, who worked in sales for technical products, moved to Britain in August to take advantage of the new policy. He said that he had often traveled to the mainland for work and had seen corruption and abuses of power. His experience convinced him that he would eventually need to leave Hong Kong after it returned to Chinese rule.
“Because of my experience in China, I predicted that Hong Kong will soon degenerate into a police state,” he said by phone from Cambridge. The security law imposed this summer “just confirmed my fears,” he said.
Overseas activists have also set up nonprofits like Haven Assistance to help Hong Kong’s protesters navigate asylum procedures abroad. Popular destinations include the United States, Britain, Germany and Taiwan, which opened a government office to assist asylum seekers from Hong Kong this summer.
The group was started by Simon Cheng, who was granted political asylum in Britain in June, and other activists. Cheng says he gets 10 to 15 inquiries a day about asylum procedures in Britain alone.
“I am now safe here, but I need to help more people,” Cheng said. “I can’t be like a free rider.”
Cheng, a former employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong, had been detained for 15 days in mainland China last year and accused of soliciting prostitution, a charge he denies. He says that while he was in custody he was beaten and hung for hours in a spread-eagle position, and coerced into making a videotaped confession.
Cheng said that as an overseas passport holder, he was eligible to stay in Britain, but that gaining asylum would demonstrate the injustice of his experience.
“I wanted to fight for my reputation, to show my detention politically motivated, that it was intrinsically persecution,” he said.

The White Issue: Has Anna Wintour’s Diversity Push Come Too Late?

Vogue’s September issue was different this year. Anna Wintour and her staff put it together when more than 15 million people were marching in Black Lives Matter protests nationwide and employees at Vogue’s parent company, Condé Nast, were publicly calling out what they viewed as racism in their own workplace. At 316 pages, the issue, titled “Hope,” featured a majority of Black artists, models and photographers, a first for the magazine.
For members of Vogue’s editorial team, the September edition came in the uneasy wake of an internal email Wintour had sent June 4. “I want to say plainly that I know Vogue has not found enough ways to elevate and give space to Black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators,” wrote Wintour, the Vogue editor-in-chief since 1988 and Condé Nast’s artistic director since 2013, making her the editorial leader of all its titles. “We have made mistakes, too, publishing images or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant. I take full responsibility for those mistakes.”
Black editors who have worked with Wintour said they saw her apology as hypocritical, part of a calculated play by an executive known for her ability to gauge the public mood. Other Black journalists who are current or former employees of Condé Nast said the email and the September issue that followed it represented an awkward, though heartfelt, attempt at genuine change.
More than any other institution, Vogue has defined fashion and beauty for generations of women, and the runway looks encouraged by the London-born Wintour, 70, have trickled down from haute couture houses to fast-fashion retailers and into the hands of everyday consumers. From Manhattan to Hollywood and beyond, she has helped set a standard that has favored white, Eurocentric notions of beauty.
The rare magazine editor who is known outside the publishing industry, Wintour — she is simply “Anna” to those in the know or those who want to be — has become a singular cultural figure. After establishing herself in fashion, media and entertainment in the first part of a career that stretches to the 1970s, she has more recently become a political power player as a bundler for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And as the orchestrator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute benefit, better known as the Met Gala, she has transformed an affair for Manhattan’s society set into a full-blown East Coast Oscars, with luminaries from fashion, music, movies and sports on the Anna-controlled guest list.
As Wintour ascended, Vogue’s publication of “hurtful or intolerant” content rarely resulted in lasting negative attention for her. But Black journalists who have worked with Wintour, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution, said they had not gotten over their experiences at a magazine whose workplace mirrored its exclusive pages.
Under Wintour, 18 people said, Vogue welcomed a certain type of employee — someone who is thin and white, typically from a wealthy family and educated at elite schools. Of the 18, 11 people said that, in their view, Wintour should no longer be in charge of Vogue and should give up her post as Condé Nast’s editorial leader.
“Fashion is bitchy,” one former Black staff member said. “It’s hard. This is the way it’s supposed to be. But at Vogue, when we’d evaluate a shoot or a look, we’d say ‘That’s Vogue,’ or, ‘That’s not Vogue,’ and what that really meant was ‘thin, rich and white.’ How do you work in that environment?”
Many of the people interviewed for this article said the racism they encountered was usually subtle, but sometimes blunt. Their main accusation was that Wintour created a work environment — and there is no facet of Vogue that she does not control — that sidelined and tokenized women of color, especially Black women.
Many Black people who worked for her said they felt so out of place in Wintour’s domain that they created white alter egos — two used the term “doppelgänger” — just to get through the workday, reconditioning their presentation and dress in a way that was mentally draining.
Some Black editors did not want to comment on the experience of fellow colleagues but offered another view. Lindsay Peoples Wagner, editor of Teen Vogue since 2018, said she had experienced uncomfortable moments in the industry, but Wintour “has given me opportunities in leadership, and I’ve made inclusivity a deep part of the conversations we’re having.”
Three other people of color said Condé Nast had made positive changes, and Wintour has promoted them to top roles. Naomi Campbell, one of the first Black supermodels, who was on the cover of Wintour’s first September issue in 1989, vehemently defended the editor.
“The first cover try I ever did, I had no idea she had to fight for me,” Campbell said. “She’s been a very important factor in my career and my life and has been honest about what she can do and what she cannot.”
The recent tumult at Condé Nast has knocked. Wintour off balance. Inspired by the protests that arose after the police killing of George Floyd in May, employees have confronted their bosses at companywide meetings and in smaller gatherings. Their complaints have led to the resignations of key editors and pledges from the chief executive, Roger Lynch, and Wintour herself, to revamp Condé Nast’s hiring practices.
“I strongly believe that the most important thing any of us can do in our work is to provide opportunities for those who may not have had access to them,” Wintour said in an emailed statement. “Undoubtedly, I have made mistakes along the way, and if any mistakes were made at Vogue under my watch, they are mine to own and remedy and I am committed to doing the work.”
Devoting the September issue — the most important of Vogue’s year — to Black contributors indicates Wintour grasps the intensity of the protest movement roiling the country. But in fashion, of course, appearances are paramount. During a large Condé Nast meeting on race in June, Wintour — who is the head of the company’s diversity and inclusion council — was conspicuously absent. Employees exchanged Slack and text messages during the session, asking the same question: “Where’s Anna?”
Cover Shots
Long before Condé Nast employees went public with complaints about the company’s handling of race, Wintour has been criticized for Vogue’s portrayals of Black people. For many readers, a 2008 cover of LeBron James and Gisele Bündchen was reminiscent of racist images of Black men from a century ago. The basketball star is bellowing and gripping the supermodel around the waist, and some saw an unmistakable parallel to a racist World War I propaganda poster. Wintour also drew criticism when she helped fashion designer John Galliano, who was fired from Christian Dior in 2011 after he was caught on camera making anti-Semitic remarks and declaring, “I love Hitler.” She continued to support Galliano even after he was found guilty of a hate crime by a Paris court.
Being indisputably the most important magazine in fashion means Vogue comes in for extra scrutiny — especially in its cover selections. Last year, The Pudding, a publisher of visual essays, used algorithms to analyze 19 years of the Vogue archives and measure the average “lightness” of cover models’ skin tones. In one span, from 2000 to 2005, only three of 81 women were Black. In a statement, Condé Nast said that from 2017 to 2020, 32% of Vogue covers featured Black women.
Former Vogue employees said that in recent years, Wintour has not kept pace with the public’s changing attitudes on issues of racism and discrimination. At a London Fashion Week party hosted by Burberry in February 2017, reality TV star Kendall Jenner showed up with a new look: fake gold teeth. Vogue noted the choice in a breezy online story written by a white contributor: “The flashing teeth felt like a playful wink to the city’s free-spirited aesthetic — or perhaps a proverbial kiss to her rumored boyfriend, A$AP Rocky.”
A Black staff member contacted one of the magazine’s executives to object, saying the story insensitively endorsed an instance of cultural appropriation, according to emails obtained by The New York Times. Other staff members brought the article to Wintour’s attention, with one lieutenant explaining by email why some people on staff and on social media had reacted negatively: “If Kendall wants to do something stupid fine but our writers (especially white ones) don’t need to weigh in and glorify it or ascribe reasons to it that read culturally insensitive.”
Wintour appeared not to grasp the issue. After several exchanges, she wrote: “Well I honestly don’t think that’s a big deal.”
Condé Nast said in a statement: “The coverage itself is not cultural appropriation.”
Vogue’s content has, though, been accused of being exactly that. The March 2017 issue showcased Karlie Kloss, a white model, in a geisha outfit, with her face in pale makeup and her hair dyed black — a blatant form of yellowface. Readers condemned the layout, which was shot in Japan by Mikael Jansson and included a photograph of Kloss with a sumo wrestler. New York Magazine’s fashion site The Cut was among the many critics, writing: “One thing’s for certain: Embracing diversity does not mean styling Karlie Kloss as a geisha.”
A Condé Nast human resources executive in charge of the company’s diversity program fielded numerous complaints and alerted Wintour. According to three people with direct knowledge of the exchange, Wintour responded that she took full responsibility but added the feature could not have been cut because of its “enormous expense.”
After an online outcry, Kloss issued an apology on Twitter: “These images appropriate a culture that is not my own and I am truly sorry for participating in a shoot that was not culturally sensitive.”
The tweet angered Wintour, according to the three people, and Kloss sent a note in an effort to mollify her. “I imagine the feeling is mutual, that it was hurtful to see the criticism from our Japan trip,” the model wrote. “I had written a short piece on social media as I wanted to make known that it was never my intention to offend or upset anyone from this spread.”
Wintour’s reply the following day was icy: “Thanks Karlie another time please give us a heads up if you are writing about a Vogue issue.” (Kloss has continued to appear in the magazine’s pages.)
In the fall of 2017, there was yet another awkward exchange on race between Wintour and Vogue staff members. It concerned a photo shoot by Patrick Demarchelier that showed several dark-skinned Black models wearing headscarves.
As Wintour weighed whether to publish the images, she asked an employee by email if they might be misconstrued as racist. But she flubbed the attempt, using a dated, offensive term: “Don’t mean to use an inappropriate word, but pica ninny came to mind,” Wintour wrote.
In a statement, Wintour said: “I was trying both to express my concern for how our readers could have interpreted a photo and raise the issue for discussion, and I used a term that was offensive. And for that, I truly apologize.”
In the 2017 email, Wintour requested that a specific Black staff member evaluate the photo shoot. The employee, an assistant, told her superiors that the work was fine. The real problem, she continued, according to several people familiar with the meeting, was why a low-ranked person such as herself had been asked to assess it. The room fell into an uncomfortable silence.
‘A Colonial Broad’
For Wintour, who descends from British nobility and was recently made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, the pace of the current moment of protest may be a challenge. But she is also the daughter of a London newspaper editor and has made a career out of anticipating and responding adroitly to cultural trends.
In 2016, Wintour made a change to her pool of assistants. (She had three aides for many years but more recently has had two.) That year, according to three Condé Nast employees, she told the company’s human resources department that her next assistant should be Black. Eventually, most of her assistants were people of color, the people said. The job is highly sought after, a steppingstone to bigger roles in fashion and media, but because it is low-paying, it usually goes to women from wealthy families. The sight of Wintour’s new adjutants made for a vivid contrast with the usual Vogue hires.
In 2017, Wintour was part of the small committee that decided to replace departing Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter with Radhika Jones, editorial director of the books department at The Times, making her one of the few top editors of color in Condé Nast’s history. Wintour has since championed Jones against in-house naysayers who complained that she had featured too many people of color in Vanity Fair. “My experiences with Anna have been nothing but positive,” Jones said. “She’s supportive of my vision, and she understands what I’ve been trying to achieve, and she has helped me to achieve it.”
Last month, Wintour replaced Stuart Emmrich, a former Styles editor at The Times, as editor of the Vogue website with Chioma Nnadi, a Black woman who had been the magazine’s fashion director. And in August, Wintour was instrumental in the hiring of superstar book executive Dawn Davis, who is Black, as the editor of Bon Appétit. (She replaced Adam Rapoport, who resigned under pressure in June after staff members accused him of running a discriminatory workplace.)
In a statement, Condé Nast said that 42% of its editors-in-chief were now people of color — all of them put in place by Wintour — and that all photo shoots are ultimately overseen by Raúl Martinez, the corporate creative director, who is the son of Cuban émigrés.
Some of Wintour’s relationships with Black editors have been rocky. André Leon Talley, a fashion titan, was one of Vogue’s most recognized personalities, often seated beside Wintour in the front row at runway shows in Paris, Milan and New York. She lavished professional and financial support on Talley, but the two had a falling-out, and he left the magazine in 2013.
This year, he published a memoir, “The Chiffon Trenches,” which reads in part as a scathing takedown of the fashion industry for its whiteness. During a promotional interview, a podcaster asked Talley about Wintour’s apology for Vogue’s “hurtful or intolerant” content. “Dame Anna Wintour is a colonial broad,” Talley replied. “She’s part of an environment of colonialism. She is entitled, and I do not think she will ever let anything get in the way of her white privilege.”
Edward Enninful, a Black editor at Condé Nast who has led British Vogue since 2017, is among the next generation of Condé Nast leaders and is often mentioned as Wintour’s potential successor at the magazine’s American flagship. The two are said to have a difficult working relationship, according to people in New York and London who have directly observed their dynamic. (In July, Enninful said that a security guard at Condé Nast’s London office racially profiled him, telling him to “use the loading bay.” Enninful described the incident on Instagram, writing “Change needs to happen now.” Condé Nast dismissed the guard, he said. The post has since been deleted.)
When Wintour promoted Elaine Welteroth, a Black woman, to a top position at Teen Vogue in 2016, the appointment was heralded as a step forward for diversity. But the promotion was fraught, Welteroth wrote in her 2019 memoir, “More Than Enough.” Instead of running Teen Vogue herself, as editor-in-chief, she was given a more ambiguous title, “editor,” and was asked to split leadership of the publication with two others. Welteroth felt that the structure effectively sidelined her, giving her less power than that of the previous Teen Vogue boss, Amy Astley. (A year after her appointment, Welteroth was named editor-in-chief. She left Condé Nast in 2018.)
“Would any of it have gone down this way if I were a White man?” Welteroth wrote.
A Summer of Discontent
The killing of Floyd set off difficult discussions about race and diversity in magazines and newspapers across the country, including at The Times. Employees everywhere have become more vocal about what they see as racist attitudes in the workplace.
At Condé Nast, Bon Appétit, a rising profit center thanks in part to its popular cooking videos, has been the red-hot center of dissent in recent months, with many of its staff members quitting in protest. Before the hiring of Davis to lead the magazine, Wintour watched closely over its editorial operations, people who worked at the property said.
At the time, people of color who had been featured in the videos complained that they were paid less than their white colleagues and that Bon Appétit had whitewashed their recipes — a trend in food journalism where ethnic cuisines are recast from a white perspective. Readers flooded the comments section of Bon Appétit’s Instagram account with messages of support for those who complained.
In a post to Bon Appétit’s account, Priya Krishna, a freelancer who had accused Condé Nast of unequal pay, was quoted as saying: “I have been forced to think outside of myself and my identity my entire career. So why can’t white editors change their mindset now?”
Wintour asked to have the item removed, according to internal Condé Nast Slack messages. But by the time of her request, the Krishna post had been online for hours, and Wintour was warned that deleting it would only attract more attention. The social media team suggested posting new content that would push the item down in users’ feeds. Wintour approved the plan, according to two people involved in the discussion.
Marcus Samuelsson, a celebrity chef who signed a one-year agreement with Condé Nast as a Bon Appétit consultant, said the company’s history with diversity “was challenging,” but he added that Wintour had worked to create more inclusivity. “She championed it from Day 1,” he said.
Many people who have worked at Vogue or with Wintour said that despite her moves toward a more diverse staff, she was still responsible for a hostile workplace. They singled out two of Wintour’s best known lieutenants: Phyllis Posnick, a Vogue editor who styled the 2017 geisha and headscarf shoots, and Grace Coddington, another fixture at the magazine.
In the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, as staff members were despondent that Clinton had lost to Donald Trump, Posnick said, in a voice that three people could hear, “I knew this was going to happen. It’s all the Blacks’ fault. They didn’t vote.” The next year, when Rihanna showed up late for Vogue’s annual fashion conference — hardly an unusual occurrence for a musician — two people heard Coddington say, “Black people are late everywhere.”
In a statement, Posnick, 78, denied making the comment. “I have never and would never say something like this for the simple fact that I don’t believe it,” she said. Coddington, 79, also disputed that she had made the Rihanna remark: “Why would I say that when I am perennially late myself?”
Coddington is perhaps the second-most visible figure of the Wintour era at Vogue, having stolen multiple scenes in “The September Issue,” a popular 2009 documentary about the magazine. In 2016, the year she switched her Vogue status from employee to freelancer, Coddington was photographed in her Manhattan kitchen, with a shelf of racist “mammy” figurines clearly visible in the background. The collection was roundly criticized.
In a statement, Condé Nast noted that Posnick and Coddington no longer contributed to the magazine.
‘Condé Nasty’
To work at Vogue is to inhabit a kind of prep school dormitory where relationships are defined by family ties and social connections that span generations. For many younger people of color who came from less rarefied backgrounds, gaining a toehold was considerably more difficult.
Condé Nast assistants famously put up with grueling hours and humiliating tasks, a job satirized in “The Devil Wears Prada,” a bestselling novel by a former Wintour assistant and later a hit movie starring Meryl Streep as the demanding boss. The hazing is seen as a rite of passage, part of why the company has the nickname “Condé Nasty.” And while Black staff members acknowledge all that, they said that race complicates matters.
Black employees are often asked to participate, or merely show up for, high-level meetings — a corporate practice known as fronting, six people interviewed for this article said. At Vogue, they have been asked to weigh in on cover images or take part in discussions with advertisers, forums that do not typically call on junior employees.
In a statement, Condé Nast said, “Anna and Vogue and all the leaders at our brands have made concerted efforts to build inclusion into all we do every day.”
In 2016, actress Lupita Nyong’o was at Vogue’s office at One World Trade in lower Manhattan to discuss a planned photo shoot. Nyong’o sat down with top editors, who had proposed photographing her in her home country, Kenya, along with some family members. The accompanying article would also focus on her family.
Nyong’o expressed concern about how her family would be portrayed, saying she feared they might come across as cultural props, according to several people with knowledge of the meeting. After a long pause, a junior editor — the only Black staff member in the room — piped up. Addressing the actress, she suggested that the shoot would be an opportunity to showcase Africa, a rarity in any American magazine, let alone Vogue.
The shoot was a go. And the junior editor was never asked to attend a fashion meeting again.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — In the final weeks of the presidential race, President Donald Trump cannot seem to stop harping on New York City.
He wrote on Twitter that his hometown had “gone to hell.” He said on Fox News recently that the city was in such despair that he might win the state in November — despite polls showing that he is far behind. And in both debates against Joe Biden, Trump referred to New York as a ghost town.
“Look at what’s happened to New York; it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town,” he said at the debate Thursday. “For so many years I loved it; it was vibrant. It’s dying. Everyone is leaving New York.”
Trump’s antagonistic stance lies in stark contrast to Biden, the former vice president who has made his home state of Delaware a central part of his narrative, referring to it several times during Thursday’s debate. But for the president, belittling New York seems to serve two purposes: It appeals to his base as a campaign strategy and allows him to address personal scores with his foes.
While many New Yorkers feel that Trump has turned his back on the city, the feeling is mutual with Trump. The city overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. There were protests when he returned to Trump Tower. His name was stripped from skyscrapers.
Democratic prosecutors in New York are digging into his family’s finances, and Democratic leaders, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, frequently accuse him of betraying his hometown. Cuomo recently accused the president of “actively trying to kill New York City ever since he was elected.”
Rep. Peter King, who is close with Trump, said the city serves as a useful foil for the president for “what happens when liberals take over.”
“If he wants to have a punching bag that plays with the rest of the country, New York City is the perfect target,” he said. “You see the boarded-up buildings. You see the dramatic increases in crime. You see people leaving for the Hamptons.”
Trump, however, has not seen much of the city’s problems firsthand. The only visit he made to the city this year was to see his ailing brother before his death in August.
Despite his absence, his aides said that Trump was still proud of being from New York, even noting that the president interrupted Biden during Thursday’s debate to say that he was born in Queens.
“President Trump loves New York City and, as you heard last night, is proud to be from Queens,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that also included many of Trump’s grievances, including “draconian shutdowns” and high taxes.
“This is a failure of state and local leadership, and this president is not going to let what is happening to New York and many other places happen to the rest of the country,” he added.
Indeed, the president last month labeled the city an “anarchist jurisdiction” and threatened to slash its funding.
But he has also rejected initiatives that would benefit New York. He refused to support a project to build a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River; he punished the city as a sanctuary for immigrants living in the country without legal permission; and he made it more difficult for New Yorkers to fly at airports in a fight over driver’s licenses for immigrants living in the country without legal permission.
The president is now balking at granting New York more coronavirus recovery funds, despite entreaties from King to reconsider. But the constant taunting from Cuomo and de Blasio — including painting “Black Lives Matter” on the street in front of Trump Tower — does not help, King said. They could play nice, he suggested, or “at least tone it down.”
At this juncture, playing nice would likely have little effect: Trump seems to regard his hometown with such acrimony that his decision to officially move his residency to Florida last year served as a de facto finalization of divorce papers.
Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House communications director under Trump, said the president views his attacks as “red meat” for voters who resent East Coast elites.
“He’s throwing New York under the bus because he thinks it’s going to help him get reelected,” said Scaramucci, who broke with Trump and endorsed Biden.
“He’s determined that those people are in battleground states and disaffected areas of the country that have a disdain for East Coasters, elitists and Wall Street,” Scaramucci said.
That strategy should ring familiar to Trump: Four years ago, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas attacked “New York values” at a Republican presidential debate. Trump bristled at Cruz’s taunts then, saying the city was a “great place” with “wonderful people.”
But Trump’s tone began to change not long after the election, which saw New York City voters side with Clinton 4 to 1.
While Trump said he wants to be competitive in New York state, he could fare worse in this election than he did against Clinton. Trump won about 36.5% of votes in the state in 2016 and is polling at less than 30% against Biden.
His standing in New York fell during the height of the pandemic and in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests, when he said that his “administration will not allow federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,” singling out New York and two other cities.
The “anarchist” designation could have a real impact on transit funding and other federal resources, although New York City officials Thursday filed a lawsuit contesting the potential funding cuts.
The two investigations in New York have also clearly rankled Trump. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office is seeking his tax returns as part of an investigation into the president and his business practices, focused on potential crimes that include tax and insurance fraud and falsification of business records.
New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, is looking into whether the Trump family’s real estate company committed fraud, and Trump’s son Eric was compelled this month to give a deposition in the matter.
The president has frequently criticized the prosecutions as politically motivated and unfounded, contending on Twitter that the investigations were products of a “politically corrupt New York.”
Given the acrimony, Trump’s visits to New York have dwindled. He made a few trips to the city last year, for the U.N. General Assembly, fundraising events and an Ultimate Fighting Championship event at Madison Square Garden.
The president received a mixture of boos and cheers at the Garden, but King, who was with Trump, said the president “was in his glory.”
“The next morning at the hotel,” King said, “cops and firefighters were taking pictures with him.”
But when the city’s largest police union endorsed Trump this summer, the rally was not held in New York. It was staged nearly 40 miles away at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Trump visited the Hamptons in August for fundraisers and came to Manhattan later that month to visit his younger brother, Robert Trump, in the hospital. The president’s only other trip to the state this year was in June to give the commencement address at West Point, about an hour’s drive north of the city.
U.S. presidents have long visited the sites of major tragedies and natural disasters. President George W. Bush visited New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and President Barack Obama visited communities after mass shootings and tornadoes.
Trump has also traveled to Florida and Puerto Rico after devastating hurricanes, and in May, the president said that he would visit New York City, where more than 20,000 people have died from the coronavirus, “when things calm down.” He has not done so.
Jesse Garcia, a county Republican leader on Long Island, said Trump had shown his love for the city by providing relief funds through the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill in March and sending the Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort to the city, along with the Army Corps of Engineers.
“I believe where he has some angst is with the ultraleft progressive socialist Democrats that have let this wonderful city rot from the inside,” Garcia said.
The president’s comments about New York’s decline could also help Republicans in local suburban House races on Long Island, King said, including ones involving Rep. Lee Zeldin and Andrew Garbarino, a state assemblyman seeking to succeed King, who is not running for reelection.
After so many slights, Cuomo said Trump would need heavy protection if he tried to return.
“Forget bodyguards,” the governor told reporters last month. “He better have an army if he’s going to walk down the street in New York.”
Edward Cox, the former head of the New York State Republican Party who is working on Trump’s presidential campaign, said the president would have no qualms about returning, despite Cuomo’s threats.
“He can come here anytime,” Cox said. “He doesn’t need an army. There would be a few protesters, but he’d be just fine.”

On a tiny barrier island in South Carolina, the three dozen protesters lined up on a muggy Saturday morning this month for the third time in six weeks.
Holding signs, they marched across a highway, over a bridge and along a wind-swept beach, pushing for the resignation of a mayor whose racially insensitive remarks in late August have outraged and divided much of the community.
Brian Henry, who is in his first term as the mayor of Pawleys Island, speculated in a Facebook post that quickly ricocheted across the region that the killings of two residents had not received national attention because the victims were white and the suspect is Black. He also characterized Black Lives Matter and antifa as terrorist organizations that were destroying U.S. cities and challenged the nation to “rise up.”
Within days, the local chapter of the NAACP was demanding Henry’s resignation. Soon, the protests gave way to a companion mission of urging residents to vote in this year’s presidential election and next year’s local elections.
“This is about a community deserving better and needing to vote to demand better,” said Marvin Neal, president of the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP, which has vowed to hold protests until Henry resigns. “This is also about race in America.”
Across the country, dozens of similar scenarios have played out in recent months, with elected officials — from mayors to school board members to fire chiefs — forced to make amends after saying something insensitive or racist, often relating to the police killing of George Floyd. But unlike in years past, when apologies might have been enough, leaders have been stepping down after outcries and public scrutiny.
It has extended beyond Floyd, too.
At a virtual hearing of the Boston School Committee on Wednesday, the body’s chair, Michael Loconto, was caught in an unguarded moment as he joked about the Asian surnames of people who wanted to speak.
He apologized a few moments later, explaining that he was “talking about a children’s book.” On Thursday, eight members of Boston’s City Council called for Loconto’s resignation, and by midafternoon, he had stepped down, joining a growing list of officials who have done the same.
“After the ongoing discussion about racism in our country, that type of comment could no longer be accepted,” said Ed Flynn, a city councilor who represents Boston’s Chinatown, as well as parts of South Boston and the South End. “Society will no longer tolerate or accept inappropriate comments from a member of city government.”
In Carbon Hill, Alabama, the mayor resigned after an uproar over his criticism of the University of Alabama’s football team’s support of Black Lives Matter.
In Harper Woods, Michigan, the mayor resigned after saying he could sympathize with the reasons a person might become a white supremacist.
And in Healdsburg, California, the mayor resigned under pressure over her handling of questions about use-of-force police policies, which led to the appointment of the first Hispanic City Council representative in nearly 30 years. About one-third of the town’s 12,000 residents are Hispanic.
“What you are seeing is a cultural moment in which the country is trying to figure out all the forms of racism and what we expect from our elected leaders,” said Susan Glisson, who leads racial reconciliation talks in municipalities, police departments, universities and corporations.
“There is also the tension of those who feel empowered to say unacceptable things and those who feel empowered to call them out,” she added. “The horror of George Floyd’s death is leading to these cultural shifts playing out on a hyperlocal level.”
The unfiltered comments — which might have landed differently before Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers, prompting thousands of protests — were shared mostly on social media by elected officials presiding over small, majority-white towns.
They were raw and revealing, and began a now familiar public arc: citizen outrage; debates over racism and cancel culture; protests and petitions. And then an eventual apology and, sometimes, a resignation.
Then came the backlash to the backlash, with some mayors refusing to leave office or give in to what they called a mob mentality. Their supporters were equally defiant, lamenting a new world smothered by unchecked political correctness and gratuitous accusations.
In Petal, Mississippi, a town of about 10,000 mostly white residents, an incendiary Twitter post by the mayor led to daily protests outside City Hall and at his home, but no resignation.
Hal Marx, a lifelong resident and the town’s mayor since 2009, batted down vociferous calls for him to quit after he wrote on Twitter, “If you can say you can’t breathe, you’re breathing,” referring to Floyd’s dying pleas while pinned under the knees of Minneapolis police officers.
For Marx, his apology was enough. “You shouldn’t lose your livelihood over a stupid remark,” he told The New York Times in an earlier interview.
About a week after Floyd’s death and the early wave of nationwide protests, Rudy Patch, mayor of Blackduck, Minnesota, a town of about 850 mostly white residents, was among the first to resign after sharing an online meme of a blood-covered Jeep that included a caption implying the vehicle had been used to run over protesters. He later said he regretted sharing the post without proper context and hoped to receive training to learn more about racism.
On a Sunday afternoon in early August, Barry Presgraves, mayor of a small historic Virginia town, posted a political meme on his Facebook page. To him, it was a lighthearted political dig at the upcoming presidential election: “Joe Biden has just announced Aunt Jemima as his VP pick.”
But some citizens of Luray, Virginia, saw something else: racism served in a 130-year syrup brand.
The three-term mayor deleted the post, but the damage was done. Many called for him to step down, including Leah Pence, a town council member.
“In our community, there is a significant amount of subliminal racism, misogyny and homophobia,” said Pence, who grew up in Luray. “This was a perfect outward example of that. Leaders are supposed to set the tone for the community.”
Initially, Presgraves, 77, said he thought the post was humorous; then he apologized to people of color and women for any hurt feelings. But leaving the office was out of the question: “Hell no — I’m not resigning,” he told a local news organization. The Town Council eventually voted to public censure him for his “harmful words.”
In the village of Endicott, New York, both the mayor and deputy mayor faced calls to resign for sharing and liking a “White Lives Matter” post on their personal Facebook pages.
Linda Jackson, the mayor, and Cheryl Chapman, the deputy mayor, did not resign, and they described themselves in a statement as women “from two different political parties who made mistakes. Together, we take blame for those mistakes.” They admitted to “ignorance of the Black Lives Matter movement” and have since attended anti-racism workshops.
For many, the twin forces of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected Black communities, and the killing of Floyd have exposed gaping disparities and ushered in a new and deeper understanding of the realities of Black life.
Black residents have opened up about experiences of racism. They have talked about sometimes fearing police and wanting more representation in local government.
On Pawleys Island, Brandi Marshall continues to simmer over the mayor’s comments. To Marshall, a former mail carrier, what Henry shared in public was something you might expect someone to say at home at the kitchen table.
“I was struck by his words but also how bold he was about saying these things in print and thinking we would just accept it,” she said. “This is not what I expect from an elected leader.”
While Marshall, 45, was contemplating the post, Henry was holding private chats to help guide his response, which he said included creating a foundation to improve race relations, along with offering scholarships and grants.
He did not respond to multiple requests for comment but said at a news conference last month that conversations with friends, faith leaders and his staff had given him “a deeper understanding of racial inequality and the importance of diversity sensitivity, which is very much needed to heal Pawleys Island, Georgetown and our country.”
His supporters said an apology was not necessary. For others, his words were inadequate and resigning is the only acceptable response.
Marshall grew up on Pawleys Island. Over the years, she and her two sons have experienced racism in the community. She said Henry’s Facebook post brought renewed attention to what she saw as a clear racial divide in the community.
So although she is slowed by illness, she joined protesters on a recent Saturday afternoon, riding behind them in a golf cart. They chanted, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Brian Henry has got to go.”

With Billions at Stake, New York Sues Trump Over ‘Anarchist’ Label

The Trump administration’s attempt to strip New York City of federal funds because the administration viewed it as an “anarchist jurisdiction” could cost the city as much as $12 billion — money for the cash-starved subway, for the Police Department and for the city’s efforts to treat coronavirus patients, city officials said Thursday.
President Donald Trump last month ordered the Justice Department to withhold federal funds from New York, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle for allowing “themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones.” Trump has repeatedly attacked the cities’ Democratic leaders for their responses to recent protests over police brutality.
The move could directly affect New York’s efforts to battle and recover from the coronavirus pandemic: Although the city was granted $2.65 billion in COVID-related funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, only $199.6 million of it has been doled out.
On Thursday, New York City officials filed a lawsuit, along with the cities of Seattle and Portland, to try to prevent the budget cuts.
The lawsuit was filed despite skepticism that the Trump administration would actually withhold federal funds from the cities; such a move, the cities suggest, would be unconstitutional and politically motivated. And if Trump should lose the presidential election in November, there is little reason to fear that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, would continue the threat.
Indeed, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York had initially disregarded the president’s threats as campaign rhetoric. But then federal officials signaled earlier this month that New York City might not be eligible for certain transit grants, and city officials grew concerned that all federal funds to the city could be jeopardized.
Trump has sought to depict the cities as crime-ridden and out of control after Black Lives Matter protests this year, warning that similar chaos could erupt across the country if Biden was elected. Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, identified the three cities as places that were permitting violence and property damage.
Barr based his decision on “an arbitrary and capricious list of misleading and cherry-picked bullet-points about each city that in no way supports the assertion that the cities have chosen to abandon their jurisdictions to lawlessness and violence,” the lawsuit said.
The cities are asking the court to declare that the designation violates the 10th Amendment, among other rules, to vacate it and to stop the federal government from taking further steps to carry it out.
If the Trump administration follows through on its threats, New York City could lose critical federal funding for the transit system, the health department and the Police Department, James E. Johnson, the city’s corporation counsel, said Thursday.
Earlier this month, the Federal Transit Administration effectively barred the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway and buses, from applying for federal funding to cover some coronavirus-related expenses. A notice on Oct. 8 said the agency would consider applications pursuant to Trump’s directive on “anarchist jurisdictions.”
The transit agency has a staggering budget hole after the pandemic wiped out its operating revenues. The MTA received $3.9 billion in federal aid in March and has lobbied for an additional $12 billion to cover its shortfall through 2021.
The cities began to prepare their lawsuit after seeing the federal notice regarding transit funding, Johnson said. He has called the president’s maneuver “a high-tech heist to try to use federal funds to coerce cities.”
The Justice Department cited criminal justice concerns for its decision: the city’s rise in shootings, property damage from the protests and the city’s decision to cut some funding for the Police Department.
“It is my hope that the cities identified by the Department of Justice today will reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens,” Barr said in a news release last month.
The Justice Department and the White House declined requests for comment on the lawsuit.
The head of the Environmental Protection Agency had also threatened last month to move its regional headquarters out of Lower Manhattan, suggesting that local agency officials had become so fearful of New York streets that they were now considering moving offices.
Shootings have nearly doubled in New York City this year to more than 1,200, compared with about 630 at this time last year, according to police statistics. There have been at least 354 murders this year, compared with 264 at this time last year.
But the crime rate is much lower than in the 1990s, when more than 2,000 people were killed in a single year. Shootings have also risen in other big cities, including Chicago, Houston, Atlanta and Denver.
De Blasio and police leaders have blamed the city’s rise in violence in part on the economic devastation of the pandemic, the release of thousands of people from jail and slowdowns in the criminal justice system.
The mayor said Thursday that his city was making a heroic comeback from the pandemic and it was wrong for Trump to try to hurt his own hometown.
“The only anarchy in this country is coming from the White House,” de Blasio told reporters.
Seattle and Portland could also face “devastating” budget cuts, according to the lawsuit. Seattle expects more than $230 million in federal grants for the fiscal year, and Portland expects $340 million.
Seattle Mayor Jenny A. Durkan said she was confident the courts would side with the cities.
“It’s immoral, unconstitutional and shameful that we are forced to expend any resources on this political theater,” she said.
On Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., who has quarreled with Trump, echoed the city’s argument that the federal designation was unconstitutional.
“Once again, Mr. President, read the Constitution,” he said.

Parents Are Worried About Schools. Are the Candidates?

Communities large and small are battling over whether and how to reopen schools closed since March. Superintendents are warning of drastic budget cuts on the horizon, teachers’ unions are calling for standardized tests to be canceled for a second consecutive year and millions of children are learning remotely, with little evaluation of the impact on their academic growth.
Yet for months now, the extraordinary challenges of schooling during the coronavirus pandemic have not been a dominant campaign theme for either President Donald Trump or his opponent, former Joe Biden.
That is partly because states and local districts have a larger role than the federal government in funding and running schools. But with so many families deeply affected by the pandemic’s upending of school routines and potentially lasting impact on childhood learning, the lack of thoughtful focus on the issue has frustrated parents and educators alike.
“It should really be a pivotal topic,” said Kisha Hale, principal of the upper grades at Eagle Academy Public Charter School in Washington, which has been providing virtual instruction to its largely low-income students since March. “With COVID-19, there are so many other things taking the focus away from education. But if our future doctors, teachers and lawyers can’t be properly prepared during this time and we’re not talking about it, what is it that we are saying really matters?”
Several recent polls have suggested the issue is a leading concern for many voters. A Politico and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health survey released last month found that schools and education was the second-most important issue for likely voters, after the economy and jobs. And a poll conducted this month in Michigan for The Detroit Free Press found that reopening schools and the economy was the top issue concerning voters, followed by the public health crisis posed by the coronavirus.
In his rallies, Trump reliably mentions that he will fight for school choice and protect charter schools, which is both a pitch to urban Black and Hispanic voters, many of whom split with the Democratic Party on those issues, and a rallying cry for conservatives. And he has consistently called for schools to reopen, threatening at one point to withhold federal funds from those that resisted.
But Trump has said little to nothing about the role of federal funding in helping districts reopen safely. And instead of calling for clear, prescriptive recommendations on reopening, he has pushed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to emphasize the importance of reopening schools, despite the concerns of many CDC scientists that the White House has minimized the risks.
Biden frequently touts proposals to triple federal spending on schools that serve large numbers of poor students and to provide free preschool to all 3- and 4-year-olds, while reproaching Trump for not reaching a deal with Congress to provide more emergency school funding. The coronavirus relief law provided an initial $13 billion in April, but groups representing educators have asked for many times that amount.
“President Trump still doesn’t have any real plan for how to open our schools safely, no real plan for how to help parents feel secure for their children,” Biden said last month about reopening schools.
But while Biden has presented ideas on how and when school districts should reopen, he has not addressed the divisions that exist within his own party about what conditions need to be in place before sending students and teachers back to classrooms.
Nor has either campaign put forth ideas on improving remote learning, or on how colleges should be handling the return to campuses — deeply relevant issues to huge slices of the electorate.
Jeanine Malec, whose three elementary-school-age children are learning remotely in Minneapolis, said she wished the candidates would acknowledge the particular challenge of remote schooling for special education students, including her daughter. “She isn’t gaining skills right now; in a lot of ways she’s losing ground,” Malec said. “How will special needs kids be helped back onto their feet in the aftermath of COVID?”
The subject of school reopening is also not a major theme of either candidate’s ad campaigns, and it got less than a minute of airtime at the first debate between Biden and Trump last month. Nor is it among the topics that Kristen Welker of NBC News plans to question them on at Thursday’s debate, although “Fighting COVID-19” is.
Education has loomed larger in some previous elections. In 2000, George W. Bush made it central to his campaign by pushing a standardized testing plan that became the bipartisan No Child Left Behind law of 2001. His father, George H.W. Bush, said during his 1988 campaign that he wanted to be “the education president,” while Barack Obama in 2008 spoke often of fixing “the broken promises” of No Child Left Behind.
But this year, the election is so much a referendum on Trump — and his handling of the pandemic — that there is less space than ever for other policy discussions. The one exception might be health care and coverage, which has dominated campaign advertisements up and down both party’s tickets and is perhaps even more top of mind for voters than schooling challenges.
Still, Frederick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, said both candidates could have more skillfully tapped the widespread angst among parents whose children are learning from home this fall.
“Parents trying to work while supervising second-graders — who’s standing up for them?” Hess said. “It seems like a political winner. But here we are two weeks before the election and we haven’t heard that case made effectively.”
He added: “A Republican president who had evinced some degree of restraint and maturity and thoughtfulness could be making those arguments very powerfully right now — but that obviously doesn’t describe Trump.”
Biden has a more difficult needle to thread. Some of his strongest support comes from teachers’ unions, which generally have opposed efforts to reopen schools. And in the Democratic cities and swing-district suburbs where schools are more likely to remain closed, and where Biden’s support is based, many parents also remain resistant to reopening as public health concerns persist and data on the safety of school reopenings is sparse.
“In my district, everybody has their Biden yard signs but it’s about a 50-50 split as to who wants their kids back in school,” said Sarah Reckhow, an associate professor of political science at Michigan State University who studies education politics. “It’s a tricky calculus for him.”
In July, Biden proposed a “five-step road map” for reopening schools, emphasizing deference to local decision-making and increased federal aid for schools. He called for “clear, consistent, effective” national guidelines to help reopening decisions but did not offer specifics, saying those decisions should be made by state and local officials in consultation with communities.
Daniel A. Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, said many of the superintendents his group represented wanted very specific recommendations. An example, he said, would be a recommendation to reopen only if less than 5% of coronavirus tests performed in a community are positive over several weeks’ time, a threshold many epidemiologists support.
“Instead, we have districts with a 20% positivity rate opening up,” he said. “There’s been no unifying guidance that says, ‘This is what we’re all going to do together.’”
Michael Casserly, the longtime executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, an organization representing about 70 large urban districts, was more resigned than indignant about the fact that school reopening issues were not a central focus of the candidates. He estimated that about 40% of his member districts have at least partially reopened. Some, he said, would rather not have politicians weighing in as they sort through how to address problems from staffing to ventilation to remote instruction.
“Many at the local level are fed up with the mixed messages they are getting from the federal and state levels,” Casserly said. “We don’t necessarily need for this to be the subject of any more political debate; we’ve had more than enough of that.”

Natalie Pontius is an interior decorator, married, with two children, and is a University of Georgia alumna. She was born and raised in Atlanta but moved to the city’s exurbs with her family several years ago, drawn to the region’s quality of public education. In November, she’s voting for Donald Trump.
The decision was a no-brainer.
“The riots, the push to defund the police — that’s not the direction our country needs to go,” Pontius, 48, said. “I feel like the Democratic Party is continually trying to come up with ways to divide us.”
She believes that Trump, on the other hand, “is looking out for me as a person.”
National polling has consistently shown that white college-educated voters are supporting Joe Biden for president. But in Georgia, even as major demographic and population shifts have pulled the state leftward in recent years, a majority of such voters remain firmly in Trump’s camp.
Recent polling shows that these voters have helped Trump maintain his razor-thin lead over Biden for Georgia’s suburban vote. Their continued support is critical to the president’s chances in the state, whose 16 electoral votes are essential for his path to reelection and where polling shows the two candidates neck-and-neck overall.
Georgia may be in the Deep South, but a steady, decadeslong influx of young, educated and nonwhite voters, coupled with a shrinking population of white voters without degrees — whose support helped fuel Trump’s victory in 2016 — have put the state increasingly in play for Democrats. From historic turnout rates among infrequent and first-time voters in support of Stacey Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial race to Lucy McBath’s triumph over Karen Handel in Newt Gingrich’s former congressional district that same year, down-ballot Democrats have proved the party’s viability in the Trump era.
For the president, that has made maintaining the loyalty of white, Republican-leaning degree-holders like Pontius all the more important. In a New York Times/Siena College survey Tuesday, Trump and Biden were tied at 45% among likely voters in Georgia, but Trump led Biden among college-educated white voters by 12 percentage points (although that is a significant contraction from 2016, when Trump won the same group by 20 percentage points).
According to more than a dozen such voters in and around Atlanta, what’s currently keeping them from jumping ship is not so much a deep affinity for Trump but a fear of “lawlessness” taking root should Democrats take the White House. Trump has spent much of the past few months stoking those fears, his campaign sending texts with such warnings as “ANTIFA THUGS WILL RUIN THE SUBURBS!”
Polling suggests that in many battleground states where protests turned violent this summer, that message hasn’t broken through. But in Georgia, many voters said Trump’s “law-and-order” appeals had struck a nerve, and almost all cited a fear that the call among some progressives to “defund the police” would materialize during a Biden presidency.
Biden has said that he has no desire to defund the police, and Amanda Newman acknowledges that. But Newman, 51, who lives in the suburbs and works at a law firm in midtown Atlanta, also thinks that Biden’s personal views are irrelevant — that a vote for Biden is in fact a vote for his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, as well as for progressives in the Democratic Party like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who have pushed for policies like the Green New Deal.
“I don’t think Joe Biden has an opinion until somebody tells him what it is,” she said.
Newman said she’s been put off by Trump at multiple moments in the past four years, calling him at times “unpresidential” and comparing him to “a 2-year-old pitching a fit in a candy store.” But she said she feared how “radical” and “crazy” the Democrats had become.
“The building I work in, they destroyed some of the windows on the ground floor,” she said. “I can’t imagine being a single female having to drive home from work at night or anywhere in Atlanta.”
Atlanta saw its share of unrest in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minnesota police in May, and again shortly after, when Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, was killed by a police officer there: Violent protesters set fire to businesses across a large swath of downtown, including the Wendy's in South Atlanta where Brooks was killed. And in February, it was in South Georgia that armed white men pursued and killed Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, prompting outrage nationwide.
“It’s been very unnerving,” said Lori Mullee, 54, referring not to police brutality or Arbery’s death but to the “riots in my backyard.” Mullee, a University of Georgia graduate, works in marketing and lives in Stone Mountain, a small city in the Atlanta suburbs that in August was essentially put on lockdown as white supremacist groups and far-left counterprotesters clashed at the city’s Confederate monument.
Mullee said she used to exercise in the state park surrounding the monument but no longer feels comfortable doing so. (As for the monument itself, she said she did not support efforts to “take down history.”) She is voting for Trump in part, she said, because she feels the left has stoked division in cities like hers and beyond.
It’s not all that surprising that educated white voters in Georgia support Trump. As a recent article in FiveThirtyEight noted, such voters are traditionally more conservative than in other parts of the country. But according to Michael Thurmond, the Democratic chief executive of DeKalb County, it also reflects the degree to which Trump’s fear-based message has penetrated the electorate. Biden’s success in Georgia, he said, depends on whether he is seen as taking that fear seriously.
Democrats could still chip away at Trump’s margins with such voters, Thurmond argued, in part by dispelling the notion that supporting racial justice and opposing “rioting and looting” are somehow at odds.
“You don’t have to choose,” he said. “But Republicans know that you can sell fear at a very low price. And they’ve taken the defund-the-police message to mean we don’t want any police, which is ridiculous.”
At the same time, Thurmond said, “we haven’t done a very good job in defining what it does mean.”
Thurmond pointed to McBath as someone trying to wrest the issue back from Republicans. She once again faces Handel in her reelection bid in Georgia’s 6th District, among the best-educated congressional districts in the country, and has repeatedly emphasized that she does not want to defund the police.
“That has never come out of my mouth,” she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week.
That Biden’s own insistence against defunding the police hasn’t resonated as deeply with white degree-holders in Georgia is in part a function of resources. With multiple true battleground states up for grabs, from Florida to Pennsylvania, Democratic strategists acknowledged that there’s only a moderate incentive to divert cash and time to places like Georgia and Texas, tight as the polling may be. Ultimately, Biden has a number of paths to 270 electorate votes should he lose Georgia; Trump, however, has a much narrower path.
Trump has visited the state multiple times since taking office, including a rally Friday in Macon. September alone saw campaign swings from Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. On Sept. 25, the president appeared in Atlanta as part of his Black Voices for Trump initiative, which he launched in the state last fall. During the Republican National Convention, the campaign featured Vernon Jones, a Black Democratic state representative supporting Trump. Following the convention, Jones called on his party to “condemn Black Lives Matter and then antifa.”
Brian Robinson, a Republican strategist in Georgia, is hopeful that the new Supreme Court vacancy will allow Trump to solidify any incremental gains he has made through his law-and-order message.
“You’re hearing people now saying that they don’t like Trump, but that the Supreme Court opening has reminded them why it’s important to have a Republican in the White House,” he said. “It’s another example of people who were wavering before but are now back firmly with Trump.”
Republicans are also confident that there remain many college-educated white voters whose support for Trump is not reflected in the polls. Indeed, some voters interviewed from the 6th District said images of the riots unfolding across the country this fall had bolstered their support for Trump but declined to speak on the record, saying they feared being stigmatized by their colleagues or neighbors.
Jake Evans, 33, who chairs the state's branch of the Republican National Lawyers Association and was recently appointed to Gov. Brian Kemp's election security task force, argued that "polling here is very deceptive." He claimed that "especially in Atlanta, you’ll go to dinner with moderate or right-leaning voters who would never say in their workplace that they’re voting for Trump, but when you’re in private, it’s all day, every day.”
Republican and Democratic pollsters alike, while acknowledging their plausibility, believe there is little evidence that “hidden” Trump voters are numerous enough to affect an election outcome. That Trump’s campaign seems to be banking on them at least in part, however, to deliver a win in Georgia, is yet more testament to how in a state that hasn’t sent a Democrat to the White House since 1992, every vote counts.
“I do think Trump is going to win our electoral votes,” Robinson predicted. “But it’s not going to be a landslide.”

Are Michigan Democrats in Trouble in Their Senate Race?

One candidate slapped on a helmet, a black leather jacket and rode his Harley Davidson across Michigan. His ads highlight his toughness on China and his support for banning Chinese travelers from entering the United States early in the coronavirus outbreak, a policy of President Donald Trump’s.
The other candidate calls himself “nonpartisan.” He denounces the way politics have become “nastier and more divisive.” His wife recently appeared in a campaign ad to talk about their young son who has asthma as a way to demonstrate her husband’s commitment to protecting health insurance for people with preexisting conditions.
Neither candidate running for U.S. Senate in Michigan seems to want voters to know whether he is the Republican or the Democrat.
For Sen. Gary Peters, the motorcycle guy and one of only two Democrats running for reelection in a state that Trump won in 2016, the path to victory becomes much easier if he can persuade enough of Trump’s supporters to vote for him.
For John James, the self-described nonpartisan Republican, success will come from the opposite situation: If enough people voting for former Vice President Joe Biden cross over to support a Republican for the Senate.
The race — one of a handful that could tip the balance in the Senate — is among the most contested and expensive in the country. Polls show a tighter race than Democrats had anticipated, and both sides are fighting for the few remaining independent, undecided voters. In an election in which the parties have focused on getting their base to turn out, Michigan stands out as a place where winning the middle could make the difference.
Polls have varied but show James with an outside chance of helping Republicans flip a Democratic seat. A New York Times/Siena College survey found Peters up by 1 point, while others put his lead in the mid-to-high single digits.
Money has been pouring in. The outside political group leading efforts for Democrats, Senate Majority PAC, put $4.4 million into Michigan last week, federal filings show — bringing its total spending in the race to over $18 million. The only state where it spent more last week was Georgia. Republicans countered by adding an additional $5.6 million to the $9 million they had already pledged to spend in the final weeks.
It’s all been a bit disorienting for some voters.
Charles Gaba, a health policy analyst and Democrat from the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Township, said his friends who weren’t as politically tuned in were not sure which candidate was the Republican and which was the Democrat. Compounding the issue, Gaba said, is the fact that James is Black, which probably makes some people assume that he is a Democrat. Peters, a middle-aged white man, fits the stereotypical image of a Republican.
“Some people are confused,” Gaba, 50, said, which could contribute to the tightness in the polls.
James, 39, a former Army helicopter pilot, has tried to steer his underdog campaign through one of the most difficult balancing acts of any Republican running for national office in this election. As a Black man on the same ticket as a president who makes overtly racist appeals to voters, James has been constrained and reticent in his criticisms, mindful that pushing back too hard could offend Trump’s intensely loyal base.
And as a candidate vying for the support of nonpartisans in a state that has trended away from Trump since he won there by 10,704 votes four years ago, James has strained to prove his independence. Democrats have attacked him for his refusal to put greater distance between himself and the president, highlighting comments like his insistence that he would “support the president’s agenda 2,000%.”
James’ campaign sees victory within reach if he can continue to tighten the race and Trump improves his standing — the latest data show Biden ahead in the state by high single digits.
Both parties are betting that despite the tribal nature of today’s politics, there are still people open to the idea of voting for a candidate from a different party in races down the ballot. That is what happened in 2016, when winning Republican Senate candidates carried battleground states by a few more percentage points than Trump on average. In bellwether Wisconsin, for instance, Trump won with 47% of the vote while Sen. Ron Johnson received 50%.
“There is this thing in America called ticket splitters,” said Curt Anderson, a Republican consultant who is advising the James campaign. “That doesn’t mean it will happen, but it happens all the time. I’m not saying it’s not harder now or that the party bases aren’t more firm. But our data is pretty clear that there’s a path for John, and we’re on it.”
Not all Republicans are convinced. The Trump campaign’s internal polling does not show Peters at considerable risk. And the money that Republicans continue to invest in the race has led aides to senators in races that appear to be much closer to complain privately to party officials.
If James wins, it would be an embarrassing blow for Democrats in a state that they assumed would be a lock. Only one Republican, a candidate for the state’s Supreme Court, has won a statewide race since Trump’s narrow victory four years ago. Democrats flipped two House seats in 2018 and won the governor’s race after eight years of Republican control.
Peters, 61, has been involved in local, state and federal politics for three decades — from the Rochester Hills City Council to the state Senate to the U.S. House of Representatives and now the Senate. But he is not well known and has not faced voters since 2014.
“Folks are just getting nervous about the entire election right now,” he said. “We know what happened in 2016 in Michigan. Hillary was up in the polls about where Joe Biden is right now. And we know how that turned out.”
He’s seen as a workhorse who prefers to operate behind the scenes but not as a particularly dynamic campaigner. Unlike the senior senator from Michigan — Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who parlayed a leadership role on the Agriculture Committee into bipartisan statewide support in her past three Senate races — Peters has been stuck in the Senate minority.
Ed Sarpolus, a Democratic political consultant and pollster, said that he’s been worried about the race for months.
“What he hasn’t done for the last six years is be visible and personable,” Sarpolus said. “What happened to his family in his ads? You’ve got to tell your story, but he’s not shown any of that this year. He looks like a professor rather than an everyday Joe.”
The motorcycle trip this summer may have been an effort to shore up support with his base of organized labor, but it didn’t help Peters with progressives, an emerging wing of the party, Sarpolus said.
James’ competitiveness is the result of fastidious discipline with his message — which critics say has consisted of avoiding settings where he would face difficult questions and then providing nonanswers the few times he has been put on the spot. Voters have found his personal narrative to be compelling — a West Point graduate and combat veteran who runs a shipping business that is part of the company that his father started.
“I don’t have a problem with Democrats because I don’t have a blue message or a red message,” James told an audience at a fundraiser on the west side of the state Friday. “I don’t have a Black message or a white message. I have a red, white and blue message.”
Big donors have loved it, as have individuals who give far less. James has raised more money than Peters has in every quarter so far this year except for in the most recent quarter when they effectively tied.
In today’s all-or-nothing political climate, a candidate who occupies the wobbly middle ground is taking major risks. For Republicans, there are usually just two paths: fealty to the president or outright defiance.
James has hardly declared his independence from Trump. His criticism of the president’s handling of the unrest over the killing of George Floyd was gentle. But his public appearances lately have spoken volumes. When Trump visited the mid-Michigan town of Freeland in September, James spoke to the thousands who came for the rally. But his speech came two hours before Trump arrived and by then James was gone. James did not appear on Saturday at the president’s rally in western Michigan.
According to recent polls, there are still large numbers of undecided voters and although they tend to lean Democratic, pollster Richard Czuba said Peters hasn’t sealed the deal.
“One of the things we found, particularly with young Black voters under 40, there is still a sizable undecided chunk out there,” said Czuba, founder of the polling firm Glengariff Group, which in an early October poll found Peters with a 5-point lead. “These are the people who Gary Peters needs to bring in and he hasn’t gotten there yet.”

Killing of White Farmer Becomes a Flash Point in South Africa

Full text: Enlarge this image.
SENEKAL, South Africa — A young white farm manager was found earlier this month strangled and tied to a pole on a farm in the eastern part of the Free State province, police said. Two Black men were accused of the murder.
At a packed court hearing on Friday, the police captain investigating the case said that the suspects were part of a ring of livestock thieves operating in the area, and that it appeared that the motive was robbery rather than racial animus.
But the killing of the farm manager, Brendin Horner, has become the latest flash point for racial conflict in South Africa, where the segregationist apartheid regime fell almost 30 years ago. Tension is particularly high in rural farming areas where white people still own a vast majority of the farms and Black people still serve as their often impoverished laborers.
Groups representing white farmers accuse the South African government of deliberately failing to protect them. Some white activist groups say that what they call “farm murders” represent the beginning of a “white genocide” aimed at driving whites out of South Africa.
Critics see this as a deeply distorted narrative promoted by the white beneficiaries of apartheid to drum up international sympathy. They point out that violent crime is common in South Africa. The vast majority of the victims are Black.
Of 21,325 murder victims last year, 49 were white farmers — accounting for much less than 1% of the country’s total, according to police statistics. White South Africans make up about 9% of the country’s 58 million citizens.
At Friday’s hearing, white farmers and motorcycle riders faced off with Black protesters in the red polo shirts of the leftist political party Economic Freedom Fighters, or EFF, outside the small rural courthouse in Senekal, a town on the banks of the Sand River. Police erected barbed wire to separate the groups, but at one point they stood nose to nose — a situation defused when volunteer marshals from both sides intervened.
On a hill outside town, white farmers waved a banner with the face of Horner and carried white wooden crosses. Some wore bulletproof vests. After reading the Bible and praying, they sang South Africa’s apartheid-era national anthem.
Some of the farmers said in interviews that South Africa’s lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the resulting economic downturn, have made poor Black South Africans more desperate.
“Usually they steal for food on the table, now they’re killing,” said Derek Meyer, a farmer at the protest.
Khanyi Magubane, a political commentator and journalist, said of the white farmers, “They don’t see the bigger picture of dysfunctionality in South Africa. Everybody is being targeted, everybody is being robbed.”
The farmers jeered as buses and minivans ferrying supporters of the EFF drove by, some passengers singing “Kill the Boer,” a liberation-era song that has since been declared hate speech.
The founding leader of the EFF, Julius Malema, a firebrand expelled from the ruling African National Congress party, addressed the crowd of about 2,500 from a portable stage outside the courthouse, saying, “We are here to fight and die against apartheid, because South Africa still has got apartheid.”
He has tapped into long-simmering anger by calling for land redistribution. In Parliament, the EFF controls 44 out of 400 seats, and accuses the majority party, the African National Congress, of moving too slowly and too cautiously on land redistribution.
A 2017 government survey found that white farmers control nearly 70% of farms held by individual owners in South Africa. Much of that land was brutally confiscated from African inhabitants generations ago. Of the vast tracts in Free State, where Horner was killed, three quarters of farms are owned by white South Africans, while Black South Africans own just 3%, the survey found.
South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, spoke out about the killing of Horner on Monday, expressing horror and sympathy, but cautioning against falsely equating the murders of white farmers with ethnic cleansing. “They are not genocidal. They are acts of criminality and must be treated as such,” Ramaphosa said in his weekly presidential address.
“What happened in Senekal shows just how easily the tinderbox of race hatred can be ignited,” he said.
In a nation with the world’s fifth-highest murder rate, Ramaphosa has in recent months used his addresses to name murder victims, particularly women killed during the lockdown. He pointed out that three young Black men were shot dead in a car in South Africa in the same week that Horner was killed.
But the violent protests over the killing of Horner grabbed immediate and outsized attention.
On Oct. 6, several hundred white protesters gathered outside the courthouse in Senekal where the two suspects were appearing for a hearing. Some protesters set a police van on fire and stormed the court holding cells, demanding that the defendants be turned over to them.
A 51-year-old white businessman, Andre Pienaar, was later arrested and charged with attempted murder, malicious damage to property and public violence. He was denied bail.
AfriForum, a large advocacy group for Afrikaners, the descendants of the white Dutch and Huguenot settlers of South Africa, has led international efforts to draw attention to their discredited claims that white farmers are being systematically forced off their land and killed in large numbers.
In 2018, after Ernst Roets, deputy chief executive of AfriForum, appeared on a segment on Fox News in the United States with the host Tucker Carlson, President Donald Trump said on Twitter that he was directing his secretary of state to investigate what he called “large-scale killing” of white farmers.
In a telephone interview, Roets said that the government does not protect white farmers: “It’s very clear this is not a priority for them to do anything,” he said.
In the courtroom on Friday, the judge was flanked by four armed police officers, government ministers occupied the benches near the front and journalists packed the room.
The country’s minister of police, Bheki Cele, who had visited the town earlier in the week in a bid to de-escalate the tensions, noted in an interview afterward that four people — three of them Black — had been killed in the area since April.
“One of them is this young white man,” he said.

ATLANTA — Lance Ledbetter was buying sweet Georgia peaches near downtown Atlanta on a sweltering June morning when he realized he was about to make a potentially catastrophic mistake: His record label, the Grammy-winning archival bastion Dust-to-Digital, would soon release its first racist songs.
In fits and starts for the previous 16 years, Ledbetter had worked on a companion to the “Anthology of American Folk Music,” the pioneering 1952 trove masterminded by the idiosyncratic collector, filmmaker and Beat philosopher-mystic Harry Smith. The six-LP series famously helped propel the folk revival of the 1950s and ’60s, and returned to prominence after it was reissued on CD in 1997. That’s the version that sparked Ledbetter’s plan to start Dust-to-Digital when he was a business student at Georgia State University.
“Dust-to-Digital doesn’t exist without it,” Ledbetter, 44, said recently, smiling in the sunny living room of the Atlanta home he shares with his wife and fellow Dust-to-Digital director, April, 41. The night he bought the “Anthology” in 1997, he stayed awake until 3 a.m., devouring six discs in one sitting.
“It changed my molecules, melted my brain,” he said. “It was an access point to a world I had seen growing up in Georgia but didn’t know.”
The concept for Dust-to-Digital’s latest project — “The Harry Smith B-Sides,” due Friday — seemed simple enough. Every song on Smith’s meticulously sequenced “Anthology” was taken from a 78-RPM single recorded between 1926 and 1934, an incomparable boom time in the history of American music, when blues, country and gospel were rapidly evolving. How would the “Anthology” sound if Dust-to-Digital flipped each record to its other side? The answer, however, has reinvigorated a long-lingering debate about how to handle the hate within the country’s early musical heritage.
Atlanta, like much of the country, seemed a live wire the morning the Ledbetters drove to the busy Grant Park market for peaches. The weekend before, protests had erupted across the city after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Ledbetters had not left home for days; they’d focused on finishing the four-disc “B-Sides,” listening to all 84 songs for the first time in five years. During a season marked by the fight for racial justice, though, a trio of old-time tunes with repeated racial slurs newly shook the couple. On the set’s fifth track, a former minstrel number transformed into a country jaunt called “You Shall Be Free,” Appalachian pair Bill and Belle Reed sang a racial slur five times and jubilantly harmonized about a lynching.
“I had headphones on, listening very close, and it made me feel sick,” April remembered. “How can we do this?”
In 2015, when the set was initially completed, the Ledbetters and their partners for the project — Eli Smith and John Cohen, New York folk aficionados and bandmates 50 years apart — grappled with that question. They opted to address the songs through pointed essays in the liner notes. For the next five years, as Dust-to-Digital struggled to license the 84 tracks from four companies including Sony and Universal Music Group, the world — and their own opinion — shifted. After Floyd’s death, they decided to affix a warning label to the box and insert another alongside the discs.
At the farmers’ market, the Ledbetters’ longtime peach vendor wondered what they had been working on during quarantine. When they told him, he strolled behind the counter and put on his morning soundtrack: the “Anthology.” Behind their masks, the Ledbetters quietly panicked. What if it would have been their set blaring from the speakers, broadcasting century-old racist songs?
“I didn’t want people washing dishes or having a dinner party when those songs came on,” Lance said. “If somebody turns up the volume, no one is going to say, ‘Oh, here’s a sticker! We’re supposed to skip this song!’ The world doesn’t work that way.”
The tracks had to go. The Ledbetters raced home and paused their order of 5,000 finished boxed sets, already on pallets and ready to board a ship in Shenzhen, China. Three of the four discs were re-pressed, unboxed, swapped and boxed again. The decision increased production costs by 10%. For the Ledbetters, the extra expense bought peace of mind.
Some listeners didn’t agree. Lance expected the cuts to produce a few academic papers. But in recent years, Dust-to-Digital has fostered an outsized and allegiant social media audience by sharing daily videos of legends like B.B. King or Sonny Rollins and international exotica, like gamelan ensembles conjuring heavy metal or a Russian man playing glass bottles.
On Facebook, commenters pounced. Some called the move “revisionist history” and “cancel culture,” others “sad” and “lame.” Emails were harsher still, accusing Dust-to-Digital of succumbing to “wimpy PC culture” or embracing censorship. “Do you think hearing a pejorative word will convert someone to Racism?” one read. “Are you that weak-minded?”
Traditional music has long struggled with issues of racial and class equity. In the United States, “folk music” has often been reduced to a lily-white realm despite foundational contributions by people of color in the blues, banjo music, zydeco and jug bands, to name just a few. Paying or crediting artists has been a perennial woe; when Smith first issued the “Anthology” on Folkways Records, the label didn’t license a single song.
Folklorists and historians, meanwhile, continue to tease out the sources of such materials, correcting names, stories and struggles previously left out of the history. Since the late ’70s, the Library of Congress has returned wax cylinder recordings of Native Americans to their descendants, a process called repatriation. The Association for Cultural Equity, launched by the field-recording scion Alan Lomax, is still doing the same with materials from the Deep South.
Folk singers have long bowdlerized troubling words in standards, dropping racial slurs or rewriting violent sagas to modernize their musical inheritance. The question of outright omission, however, is a more nebulous one in an age of instant online access. (It takes seconds to find the missing “B-Sides.”)
Steve Weiss, longtime curator of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill’s Southern Folklife Collection, said his staff has become more proactive about labeling “hurtful content.” Not presenting it, though, frames an incomplete picture. “These tracks are an ugly truth,” Weiss said. “If you’re going to have a real conversation, those songs have to be a part of it.”
But for musician Dom Flemons, that’s not the point of a set like Smith’s, which he calls his “Rosetta Stone.” Flemons, who is Black and Mexican American, has long subverted stereotypes of traditional music and the people who play it. He co-founded the Carolina Chocolate Drops and, as the self-proclaimed “American Songster,” commands a dizzying array of sources, styles and instruments. For him, Smith’s decision 70 years ago to omit each performer’s race — and the songs with racist epithets — suggested that “music is open-ended, a highway.”
“Especially for a box set that may serve as an introduction, you want to be very cautious to not make people feel excluded,” Flemons said. “You don’t want people to feel they can’t be involved.”
Dust-to-Digital followed Smith’s lead. The label’s 2003 debut — a six-CD compendium of the United States’ earliest gospel recordings, called “Goodbye, Babylon” — offered a similarly integrated interpretation of the country’s music. Mahalia Jackson’s towering “Amazing Grace” shared space with the Carter Family’s bucolic “Keep on the Sunny Side,” Texas blues titan Blind Lemon Jefferson with Appalachian lawyer Bascom Lamar Lunsford.
A former college radio DJ, Lance started assembling “Goodbye, Babylon” when he realized that most reissue compilations overlooked sacred music. He and April began dating as he began four years of painstaking work on the project. A Georgia State film student who loved deep research, she volunteered, transcribing fire-and-brimstone songs and sermons from scratchy recordings. April was charmed by Lance’s obsession; he was taken by her organizational charge.
The label defines their shared life. Even now, their dual offices occupy the bedrooms on their cozy house’s main floor; the living room’s centerpiece is a pair of customized LP shelves, flanking a window-framed record player and crowned by the triptych of their Grammys. The basement houses their shipping-and-storage operations and a bulky scanner. The Ledbetters sleep in the attic, in a small lofted bedroom.
“Trying to work together and be a couple was challenging,” April said, holding their cat, Louie, for Louis Armstrong. “It’s something we still navigate. Lance could work all day and all night, but I stop working, start thinking about dinner.”
“Goodbye, Babylon” became a surprise hit, selling more than 20,000 copies despite an initial pressing of 1,000. Bob Dylan gave one to Neil Young, who dubbed it “the original wealth of our recorded music.” The success allowed the Ledbetters to pursue more audacious projects, united by an ecumenical approach to what “traditional music” might mean. They have issued the work songs Alan Lomax recorded at Mississippi’s infamous prison, Parchman Farm, and several lavish collections of early African recordings. They have released archival blues from Black laborers in Florida and the Depression-era hillbilly laments of Blind Alfred Reed, a fiddler who sang of hard times in West Virginia.
Still, the “B-Sides” wasn’t the first time Dust-to-Digital confronted the revisionist romanticism inherent to their niche. In 2004, not long after “Goodbye, Babylon” arrived, the Ledbetters visited fellow collectors in Baltimore. They met Gabriel Jermaine Vanlandingham-Dunn, one of the few Black managers in the city’s network of independent record stores.
The grandson of native Southerners, Vanlandingham-Dunn wanted to buy “Goodbye, Babylon.” But when he slid open its cedar box, twin rows of raw cotton balls surrounding the discs infuriated him, a tone-deaf symbol of the racist South his ancestors endured. He asked Lance to justify the design and balked at the simplistic explanation — cotton was a thread between poor people across the South, Lance offered, much like the music itself.
“I remember telling him, ‘If my grandfather would have seen that, he would have shot you,’” Vanlandingham-Dunn said from Philadelphia, where he is a writer. “I reminded Lance that white people weren’t enslaved or denigrated the same way Black people were. It’s fine to enjoy this music, but if you’re not paying attention to the situation of the people who created it, that’s a real problem.”
Years later, Lance admitted he made a naive mistake. His pride in his concept and self-absorption with the new label, he reckoned, didn’t allow him to understand its impact on someone else.
Similar devotion to Smith and his “Anthology” almost prevented the Ledbetters from cutting the three racist tracks. Indeed, “B-Sides” feels like a reliquary for Smith: The box’s cover is a linoleum floor tile he designed, the book cover a riff on his typewriter art. The song descriptions emulate his incisive humor — “Pork Chop Speaks to Hungry Man, Offering Respite and Carnal Satisfaction,” reads one.
“We were beholden to this concept. We wanted to be historically accurate,” Lance said, sighing. “That was wrong.”
The critic Greil Marcus encapsulated Smith’s “Anthology” as a document of “Old, Weird America,” a wild and hardscrabble landscape that largely disappeared through cultural homogenization. But the most bracing thing about it and “B-Sides” might be how germane many of their songs seem.
“Ever woke up in the mornin’, jinx all around your bed?” Charley Patton moans on the “B-Sides” track “Screamin’ and Hollerin’ the Blues,” signaling the immortality of these situations. A president’s health fails during “The Road to Washington,” while the poor consistently pine for heavenly relief. People party, lust, repent and repeat. Addiction, depression and suicide abound. Had they not been cut, those racist tracks would only serve as insulting reminders of what else hasn’t changed in an American century.
Five seconds tick by for each of the missing songs on “B-Sides.” The gaps recall the empty pedestals and vacant spaces that now dot the landscape where Confederate statues once stood, many erected around the time these tunes were recorded. The silence is hard to ignore. As Nathan Salsburg, a guitarist and curator of the Alan Lomax Archive put it, “You don’t need those tracks to unpack their historical baggage.” The decision to cut them says more about the world the Ledbetters hope to help shape than any history they’re ignoring.
“Racism exists, of course. You have to make the choice to take a stand,” April said, leaning against wall-to-wall basement shelves stuffed with books about the South and music. “We create meaning through selection and choice. We like libraries, but we don’t work at one.”

NEW YORK — For several months, as the pandemic has worsened New York City’s financial outlook, business leaders have cast around for one of their own to run for mayor next year.
They offered their support and floated the possibility of tens of millions of dollars in campaign donations for the right candidate, someone more favorable to the business community than the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, and with the financial background to keep the city solvent.
That candidate has apparently emerged.
Raymond J. McGuire, one of the highest-ranking and longest-serving Black executives on Wall Street, announced Thursday that he is leaving his post at Citigroup to prepare for a run for the Democratic nomination for mayor, just eight months before the primary.
McGuire, 63, a vice chair at Citigroup, had been mulling a potential run for months. Although he is well known in the financial world — he was one of three finalists in 2018 to become president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — he is far less known to voters, who must be persuaded to back a first-time candidate over more established rivals.
He will also have to raise funds in a compressed amount of time; McGuire said that he would not participate in the city’s matching campaign finance system, allowing him to accept larger donations.
With New York City battling simultaneous crises that cut deep into the heart of its character and intensity, McGuire said he believes that he is better suited than his rivals to guide a recovery.
The city faces the loss of at least $9 billion in tax revenue over the next two fiscal years, which could cause the layoffs of tens of thousands of city workers. The city is also dealing with a national reckoning over discriminatory policing, while shootings and homicides have risen in recent months.
“New York gave me the opportunity to be enormously successful,” McGuire said in an interview. “Now New York is in a financial crisis that has exploded into a whole bunch of crises — educational, health and criminal justice. If there is a moment in history where my skill set can help lead, this is it.”
For the last 18 months, McGuire said, his peers in the business world have tried to persuade him to run. William M. Lewis Jr., co-chair of investment banking at Lazard, said McGuire had “a unique understanding of why Black lives matter,” but also of the financial crisis the city faces.
“We need someone who is going to walk into the room and say, ‘Let me see the spreadsheets, and let’s deal with the crisis at hand,’” said Lewis, who has known McGuire since their days as undergraduates at Harvard. “We need somebody who is going to be able to get their hands around this budget, talk to Washington and help get us more money. We need somebody who’s going to say everyone needs to pay their fair share.”
McGuire joins a growing field of declared and likely candidates, including the Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams; Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller; Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive; a former federal housing secretary, Shaun Donovan; Maya Wiley, a civil rights lawyer and former counsel for de Blasio; Kathryn Garcia, the former sanitation commissioner; a Brooklyn councilman, Carlos Menchaca; and Loree Sutton, the former veteran affairs commissioner.
City laws prevent de Blasio from running for a third consecutive term.
Many successful business leaders, like Ronald Lauder and John A. Catsimatidis, have in the past tried and failed to win the mayoralty. But the notion that a sudden shift or a calamity could alter the trajectory of New York City’s elections is hardly implausible.
The fiscal crisis of the 1970s helped push Edward I. Koch into office in 1977; he was then unseated in 1989 by David N. Dinkins, whose campaign to become the city’s first Black mayor took flight after the racially motivated murder of Yusuf Hawkins in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.
In 2001, Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman then running as a Republican, captured the general election, an upset that was widely attributed to the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center and its devastating aftereffects on the city’s economy and psyche.
McGuire resisted comparisons to Bloomberg. Raised by his mother, a social worker who was a single parent, and his grandparents in Dayton, Ohio, McGuire said he has never met his father. Scholarships helped him attend the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, and McGuire went on to attain degrees from Harvard College, Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.
“I doubt we’ve arrived at the point where we would hear anyone who followed in my footsteps being called the white Ray McGuire,” he said. “Judge me on my merits.”
McGuire lives on Central Park West with his wife, Crystal McCrary McGuire, a lawyer and filmmaker, and their 7-year-old son, Leo. The couple also have two children from McCrary McGuire’s previous marriage to former New York Knicks player Greg Anthony: an 18-year-old daughter, Ella; and a son, Cole, 20, who is a potential first-round pick in the coming NBA draft.
The apartment is filled with works from African American artists like Romare Bearden and Charles Alston (McGuire serves on the boards of the Whitney and the Studio Museum in Harlem). He and his wife also own a home in Bridgehampton, New York.
He is known to quote Notorious B.I.G. lyrics (“If you don’t know, now you know” is one of his favorites) and the character of Omar Little from “The Wire” and is fond of saying he is comfortable anywhere from the “streets to the suites.” During a recent visit to the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network in Harlem, McGuire spoke about the history of the civil rights movement with the cadence of a Black minister.
Despite his Wall Street pedigree, McGuire said that when he is coming home from the gym in workout gear, he is viewed as just another 6-foot-4 Black man.
“I could easily be the next George Floyd,” said McGuire, who has referred to Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis as “coldblooded murder.”
The disparate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Black and Latino people is merely the most recent example of “systemic, institutional racism,” said McGuire, who wrote the introduction to a recent report from Citi that concluded that $16 trillion could have been added to the U.S. economy if four key racial gaps facing Black Americans had been closed.
While McGuire has spoken out against discriminatory policing, he is not calling for police departments to be defunded. Last year, along with other Black leaders, McGuire signed a letter to The New York Times denouncing episodes in which police officers were doused with water in Harlem.
Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, said the comparisons to Bloomberg were inevitable.
“There is already a 12-year record of what happens when a rich person becomes mayor,” Greer said. “With the issues the city needs to handle, voters may want the next mayor to be someone who fundamentally understands city government.”
But Kirsten John Foy, a civil rights leader who has not endorsed a mayoral candidate, said he met with McGuire at the basketball court of Marcy Houses in Brooklyn to hear his vision for the city.
“He’s an intellectually curious and highly successful Black man that wants to serve,” Foy said. “That narrative is appealing to people of all ages and all colors.”

NEW YORK — Amy Cooper, the white woman who called police on a Black bird-watcher in Central Park, made a second, previously unreported call to 911 in which she falsely claimed that the man “tried to assault her,” a prosecutor said Wednesday.
“The defendant twice reported that an African American man was putting her in danger, first by stating that he was threatening her and her dog, then making a second call indicating that he tried to assault her in the Ramble area of the park,” Joan Illuzzi, a senior prosecutor, said.
The second call was disclosed as Cooper appeared remotely in Manhattan Criminal Court to answer a misdemeanor charge of filing a false police report, which carries a maximum sentence of a year in jail.
Cooper had been charged in July, and no additional charges were announced Wednesday. Illuzzi said the Manhattan district attorney’s office was negotiating a possible plea deal with Cooper that would allow her to avoid jail.
The hearing was the latest development in the Memorial Day weekend encounter that resonated across the country and reignited discussions about the potential danger of false accusations made to police about Black people.
Cooper was filmed calling 911 from an isolated area in Central Park after a Black man asked her to leash her dog, as the rules required. During the first call, she said multiple times that an “African American man” was threatening her, emphasizing his race to the operator as she raised her voice frantically.
Video of the encounter, shot by the man, Christian Cooper, on his phone, has been viewed nearly 45 million times. Its timing, one day before protests erupted nationwide over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, only deepened its role in sparking outrage over what many viewed as an example of everyday racism. (Amy Cooper is not related to Christian Cooper.)
But prosecutors said Cooper made a later call to 911, which was not shown in the video. In that call, Cooper told the dispatcher that Christian Cooper had tried to assault her, according to a criminal complaint.
When police arrived, however, Cooper told an officer that her reports were untrue and that Christian Cooper had not touched or assaulted her, the complaint said.
The criminal complaint mentioned two calls, but charged her with only one count.
Illuzzi told the court that Cooper had used police in a way that was “both racially offensive and designed to intimidate,” and that her actions were “something that can’t be ignored.”
Still, the prosecutor said the district attorney’s office was exploring a resolution to the case that would require Cooper to take responsibility for her actions in court and attend a program to educate her on how harmful they were.
“We hope this process will enlighten, heal and prevent similar harm to our community in the future,” Illuzzi said.
Judge Nicholas Moyne adjourned the case until Nov. 17 to give Cooper’s lawyer, Robert Barnes, and prosecutors time to work out the details of an agreement.
“We will hold people who make false and racist 911 calls accountable,” the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement Wednesday. “Fortunately, no one was injured or killed in the police response to Ms. Cooper’s hoax.”
Barnes said in July that Cooper would be found not guilty if the case went to trial and criticized what he called a “cancel culture epidemic.”
“How many lives are we going to destroy over misunderstood 60-second videos on social media?” he asked. Barnes declined to comment Wednesday.
Vance’s decision to charge Cooper drew mixed reactions from Black community leaders and proponents of overhauling the criminal justice system. He also did not have the support of Christian Cooper, who has long been a prominent birder in the city and sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society.
As the episode gained widespread attention across the country, Cooper, who had been a head of insurance portfolio management at Franklin Templeton, lost her job and was publicly shamed. She also surrendered her dog temporarily to the rescue group from which she had adopted it.
At the time, Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old Harvard graduate who works in communications, said that the consequences and public backlash she had faced were already enough. He did not cooperate with the prosecution’s investigation and said in a statement in July that “bringing her more misery just seems like piling on.”
In an interview Wednesday, Christian Cooper declined to answer specific questions about the second 911 call or about Amy Cooper’s potential plea deal. The encounter in Central Park was “not about Amy Cooper,” he said, but about a larger societal problem.
“My response is very simple: We have to make sure we don’t get distracted,” Christian Cooper said. “We have a very important goal — and we have to stay focused on it — which is reforming policing, getting systemic change to the structural racism in our society.”
Weeks after the confrontation, New York state lawmakers approved legislation entitling people to “a private right of action” if they believed that someone called police on them because of their race, gender, nationality or any other protected class. The move was a direct response to the Central Park run-in and other false reports to police about Black people.
The clash began as Christian Cooper biked to search for birds in a semi-wild section of the park known as the Ramble, where dogs must be leashed. He encountered Amy Cooper, walking with an unleashed dog, and said in a Facebook post that she refused to put a leash on the dog when asked.
He wrote that he offered the dog treats in an effort to persuade Amy Cooper to follow the area’s rules. Then, video captures her calling 911 and telling an operator, “I’m in the Ramble, there is a man, African American. He has a bicycle helmet, and he is recording me and threatening me and my dog.”
One day after the incident, Amy Cooper issued a public apology.
“I reacted emotionally and made false assumptions about his intentions when, in fact, I was the one who was acting inappropriately by not having my dog on a leash,” Cooper said in the statement. “I am well aware of the pain that misassumptions and insensitive statements about race cause.”

Long before Joe Biden was smashing online fundraising records, long before it was clear he would become the Democratic nominee, his campaign was facing a serious cash crisis.
It was late summer 2019 and Biden’s online fundraising had slowed to such a trickle that his team basically had to shut down its digital advertising program. They knew the choice was self-defeating: No more online ads meant no more finding new donors. The campaign bottomed out in early September 2019 when Biden raised just $24,124.17 online in a day.
Now? On one recent day, Biden was raising more than that every two minutes.
The unlikely transformation of Biden, a 77-year-old whose seemingly limited appeal to small donors left him financially outflanked in the primaries, into perhaps the greatest magnet for online money in American political history is a testament to the ferocity of Democratic opposition to President Donald Trump.
In a little over a year, the former vice president’s online fundraising had increased 1,000-fold, to $24.1 million on Sept. 30.
Biden now has a once-unimaginable cash edge over Trump, and since Sept. 1 he has reserved about $140 million more in television advertising than the president. Money alone does not determine presidential winners — Hillary Clinton vastly outspent Trump in 2016 — but the cash has provided Biden enviable flexibility to engineer the electoral map to his advantage.
“There was always going to be a large amount of money coming into the nominee,” said Michael Whitney, a Democratic digital fundraising specialist who worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary. “I’m sure they never dreamed it would be this big.”
To chart Biden’s consequential financial turnabout, The New York Times analyzed the flow of nearly 11 million online contributions from the first nearly 500 days of his campaign. The analysis looked at $436 million given through August to Biden and his shared committee with the Democratic National Committee via ActBlue, the donation-processing platform. Checks, merchandise sales and other offline giving were not included.
The Times analysis shows four inflection points in Biden’s fundraising metamorphosis, beginning with one unwittingly provided last fall by Trump, whose presidency has been rocket fuel for Democratic fundraising.
The other three points — all linked in different ways to race — emerge from the 2020 data: Biden’s sweeping victories delivered by Black voters in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, the protests after the police killing of George Floyd and, especially, the selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Harris, in particular, turbocharged his fundraising. Biden’s previous high for online donations in a day had been 102,143 contributions. On Aug. 11, the day he picked Harris, he received 252,982. The day after, he topped 300,000.
Biden’s committees raised a record-shattering $364.5 million in August, including $205 million online. Then he bested that total in September, officials said.
Teddy Goff, a top digital strategist for Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012, called those sums “shocking amounts.”
“It wasn’t at all clear that a candidate who didn’t spend the last decade building an email fundraising list, and who isn’t associated with the movement wing of the party, would have such flabbergasting success,” he said.
This is how it happened.
Trump’s Ukraine call sparked impeachment — and Biden’s fundraising
The first event that reversed Biden’s financial trajectory came not long after he had scrapped his ad budget: the September 2019 news that Trump had pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden’s son. That act eventually spurred the president’s impeachment. For many Democratic primary voters, it also was a blunt reminder of Biden’s polling strength against Trump.
In the 40 days before the call burst into view, on Sept. 20, 2019, Biden had raised about $62,500 online per day, on average; in the 40 days that followed, he averaged over $159,000.
It was something of a financial lifeboat. Over the previous three months, Biden had been spending more than he raised, depleting his cash reserves. The extra $100,000 a day helped keep the campaign afloat, officials said.
Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Biden, said that Trump’s seeking help from Ukraine “made it clear to the whole world which candidate he feared facing most.”
“And we capitalized on that in a way that produced real results,” she said.
Biden’s average daily haul would never again dip below the six-figure mark.
Still, Biden mostly plodded along financially the rest of the pre-primary season. He averaged raising $169,059 per day online last October, $136,518 in November, $128,912 in December and $168,674 in January.
In other words, there was no growth.
At the same time, donations to his rivals ballooned. By late February, Biden was teetering politically and had spent only the sixth most of the Democratic field.
South Carolina resurrected Biden
Then came South Carolina.
With Sanders threatening to seize control of the primary, Black voters gave Biden a decisive victory — and online money rained down: more than $5 million on Feb. 29 and $5 million the next day. Days later, Biden swept through Super Tuesday to amass a delegate lead he would never relinquish.
Biden would raise $25.3 million online over seven days — more than he had in the previous four months.
Just as significant, Biden’s fundraising floor was suddenly and permanently higher — even as the coronavirus pandemic soon froze American life. He averaged about $615,000 per day until Sanders dropped out in early April; the rest of that month, Biden’s daily average jumped to $1.1 million.
Biden’s email and text lists were still excruciatingly small for a presumptive nominee. “A lot of people were pessimistic about the Biden campaign’s ability to ramp up their digital campaign because they were not as sophisticated in the primary as other candidates,” said Tara McGowan, a Democratic digital strategist.
Biden’s new campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, rushed to make up ground. She cast aside a proposal to outsource much of the digital operations to a firm, Hawkfish, created by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, and instead went on a hiring and spending spree. Almost 40% of Biden’s April outlays — $4.7 million of $12 million — went into ads seeking new supporters online, according to federal records and campaigns officials.
The investments were approved even as the economy cratered, other campaign departments clamored to expand and the payoff seemed uncertain.
“People were nervous and scared,” said Rob Flaherty, the campaign’s digital director. “Politics was a secondary thing.”
Donations stagnated at first despite the spending, and even regressed. In the first weeks of May, Biden’s daily online haul had dipped below $775,000, despite nearly a third of the campaign’s total budget going into donor prospecting.
Floyd’s killing prompted an outpouring
In the first weeks of May, the Biden campaign was regularly at risk of missing internal digital fundraising goals, according to an official familiar with the matter, and often needed external boosts to help hit its metrics.
Then came the video of Floyd’s death that set off nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.
Millions of dollars spontaneously flooded into racial justice groups and Black-led organizations — and also Biden’s coffers. On May 27, Biden raised $1.3 million, starting his first-ever two-week stretch of days above $1 million.
On June 2, Biden delivered his first speech outside his home since the pandemic froze campaign activities, speaking in Philadelphia on race relations the day after the Trump administration had used smoke, flash grenades and chemical spray to clear peaceful protesters outside the White House for a photo op. More than $3.2 million poured in — Biden’s biggest day since the week of Super Tuesday.
Hate-giving is a well-known phenomenon for Democratic donors in the Trump era, and Biden becoming the vessel to take down Trump has been a financial boon.
“Joe Biden showed up and he was the counter-president in that moment,” said Caitlin Mitchell, a former top DNC official who joined the Biden campaign as a senior digital strategist in May.
The Biden campaign began furiously spending to capture the newfound energy, directing as much money into Facebook ads in the first days of June as it had in its first 10 months.
From March 1 to July 1, the campaign’s email list quintupled. The Floyd-inspired protests were a clear turning point, with 2.6 million added in June alone. Biden had averaged raising $795,000 per day in the preceding 75 days; that figured doubled to $1.65 million over the following 75 days.
Harris’ impact was astronomical
Biden’s choice for his running mate was a closely guarded secret by the campaign’s inner sanctum leading up to Harris’ August unveiling. A special Slack channel was set up, with a slowly expanding list of people invited on a need-to-know basis, hour by hour. The goal was to break the news via text message.
But a minute before the text went out, the Biden-Harris campaign website accidentally went live, according to campaign officials, although the mix-up went undetected.
The rush of money that followed was staggering.
The selection of Harris proved so popular, so quickly, that the campaign opened a new fulfillment center just for yard signs. More than $48 million flooded into the campaign in those heady first 48 hours, roughly 80% from online; by the end of the month, all 14 of Biden’s biggest days for online fundraising had come after forming the Biden-Harris ticket.
“This level is not inevitable,” said Whitney, the former Sanders strategist, who credited an investment in staff and digital infrastructure. “They have done very well to reach the maximum.”
A Biden campaign that once had only five aides dedicated to online fundraising now counts 45, including those integrated with the DNC.
In one notable move, the Biden campaign sent news of Harris’ selection to the full dormant list of the DNC, something campaigns are generally averse to doing out of fear of tripping spam filters, and again after her convention speech. Those two emails, campaign officials said, reactivated 875,000 supporters.
The Biden campaign raised an average of $8.1 million a day online in the last three weeks of August, after Harris’ selection and during the two national conventions. That is $2.5 million more than its previous biggest day.
“In digital, our job is to make windmills,” said Flaherty, the digital director. “The candidate has to make the wind.”

‘Straight to Gunshots’: How a U.S. Task Force Killed an Antifa Activist

Michael Reinoehl was on the run.
A few days after a shooting left a far-right Trump supporter dead on the streets of Portland, Oregon, Reinoehl, an antifa activist who had been named in the news media as a focus of the investigation, feared that vigilantes were after him, not to mention the police. Even some of his close friends did not know where he was.
But the authorities knew.
On Sept. 3, about 120 miles north of Portland, Reinoehl was getting into his Volkswagen station wagon when a pair of unmarked sport utility vehicles roared through the quiet streets, screeching to a halt just in front of his bumper. Members of a U.S. Marshals task force jumped out and unleashed a hail of bullets that shattered windows, whizzed past bystanders and left Reinoehl dead in the street.
Attorney General William Barr trumpeted the operation as a “significant accomplishment” that removed a “violent agitator.” The officers had opened fire, he said, when Reinoehl “attempted to escape arrest” and “produced a firearm” during the encounter. But a reconstruction of what happened that night, based on the accounts of people who witnessed the confrontation and the preliminary findings of investigators, produces a much different picture — one that raises questions about whether law enforcement officers made any serious attempt to arrest Reinoehl before killing him.
In interviews with 22 people who were near the scene, all but one said they did not hear officers identify themselves or give any commands before opening fire. In their official statements, not yet made public, the officers offered differing accounts of whether they saw Reinoehl with a weapon. One told investigators he thought he saw Reinoehl raise a gun inside the vehicle before the firing began, but two others said they did not.
Reinoehl did have a .380-caliber handgun on him when he was killed, according to the county sheriff’s team that is running a criminal homicide investigation into Reinoehl’s death. But the weapon was found in his pocket.
An AR-style rifle was found apparently untouched in a bag in his car.
Five eyewitnesses said in interviews that the gunfire began the instant the vehicles arrived. None of them saw Reinoehl holding a weapon. A single shell casing of the same caliber as the handgun he was carrying was found inside his car.
Garrett Louis, who watched the shooting begin while trying to get his 8-year-old son out of the line of fire, said the officers arrived with such speed and violence that he initially assumed they were drug dealers gunning down a foe — until he saw their law enforcement vests.
“I respect cops to the utmost, but things were definitely in no way, shape or form done properly,” Louis said.
The U.S. Marshals Service declined to comment for this article, citing the pending investigation. The agency previously said that it had attempted to “peacefully arrest” Reinoehl and that he had threatened the lives of law enforcement officers.
President Donald Trump, who has described the racial justice protests that have roiled the nation as the work of lawless criminals, praised the operation.
“This guy was a violent criminal, and the U.S. Marshals killed him,” the president told Fox News. “And I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.”
‘That shot felt like the beginning of a war’
Reinoehl had joined protesters in Portland in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing by the Minneapolis police in May, writing online that they were waging a necessary war with the potential to “fix everything.” He devoted himself to the Black Lives Matter movement and once touted himself as “100% ANTIFA all the way.”
Reinoehl, a 48-year-old contractor and professional snowboarder, had run into trouble with the law in June, when he was cited for driving under the influence of a controlled substance and having an unlicensed firearm in the car. Later, during the protests, the police arrested him and cited him for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place, but prosecutors dropped the charges.
When the protests against the police got underway in Portland, he carved a niche for himself providing security, watching for agitators. After a caravan of supporters of Trump arrived in Portland on Aug. 29 and began clashing with the protesters, a security camera showed Reinoehl keeping an eye on one of them — Aaron J. Danielson, a supporter of the far-right group Patriot Prayer who was walking with a can of bear repellent and an expandable baton.
Seconds later, a separate livestream video captured Danielson being shot, and The Oregonian newspaper reported later that Reinoehl was under investigation in the case. In an interview while he was in hiding that Vice News broadcast on Sept. 3, Reinoehl said he had fired in self-defense. “That shot felt like the beginning of a war,” he said.
A quiet night and a sudden raid
On the day the interview aired, officers with the U.S. Marshals’ Pacific Northwest Violent Offender Task Force met for an intelligence briefing.
The team, which included a mix of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, already knew that Reinoehl was staying in a brick complex of apartments in Lacey, Washington. The task force had information from an informant, passed on by the Portland police, about Reinoehl’s location and possession of firearms, said Lt. Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office, who leads the team investigating Reinoehl’s death.
Though the Portland police had yet to issue a warrant for Reinoehl’s arrest, the task force prepared to move in.
That evening, outside the apartment complex where the police say Reinoehl had been staying, the neighborhood was quiet.
Louis, a carpenter and former U.S. Army medic, watched his son ride his bike with his younger brother and a neighborhood friend. Around the corner, Chad Smith and two friends, Chase Cutler and Jon Chastain, were wrapping up an afternoon spent working on cars.
Reinoehl left the apartment and walked toward his Volkswagen, parked along the street roughly 100 feet away. Two officers positively identified Reinoehl, who proceeded to get into the car, said Brady, who shared some of the initial findings of the investigation with The New York Times. They decided to make an immediate arrest, the officers told investigators, in part to avoid a high-speed chase.
Smith said he and his friends turned their heads to the sound of a vehicle accelerating rapidly, headed southbound toward the street where Reinoehl was walking. A second law enforcement SUV, which had been parked across from Smith’s house, moved in with such speed that the friends thought they were witnessing a road rage incident or a gang shooting.
Smith and Cutler ran after the unmarked SUVs, watching as they turned onto Reinoehl’s street, one cutting the corner and speeding over the grass.
Nate Dinguss, who according to Brady lived in the apartment where Reinoehl was staying, said Reinoehl was chewing a gummy worm as he approached his station wagon, with a phone in one hand and a bag in the other.
Dinguss said in an interview that officers began jumping out of the vehicles before they had come to a complete stop, and that one of them opened fire immediately, before any commands had been given. Another man who was walking his dog nearby said that a burst of about 10 gunshots began almost immediately after the SUVs came to a halt, and that he did not recall hearing any commands. Louis, who was on the other side of the scene, some 140 feet from Reinoehl, also said the police opened fire immediately, without giving any warnings — as did Smith and Cutler.
“There was no, ‘Get out of the car!’ There was no, ‘Stop!’ There was no nothing. They just got out of the car and started shooting,” Louis said.
Smith described it similarly: “There was no yelling. There was no screaming. There was no altercation. It was just straight to gunshots.”
Of the 22 people interviewed by The Times who said they were near the shooting when it occurred, only one man reported hearing any shouting before the gunshots began.
That man, Quentin Gruner, whose apartment is about 75 feet away, said he was letting his dog out when he heard shouting that he thought was neighbors having a fight, followed by a popping noise.
The four officers who were riding in the SUVs said in their statements to Thurston County sheriff’s investigators that they shouted “Stop! Police!” before opening fire, Brady said.
But the officers gave conflicting stories about what led them to begin firing. One reported that he saw Reinoehl, inside the vehicle, raise “what they perceived to be a gun,” Brady said. Two other officers said they only saw Reinoehl make “furtive movements” toward the center console, he said.
Brady said the first shots appear to have struck Reinoehl inside the vehicle, and videos of the aftermath show bullet marks in the driver’s side of the windshield. Though apparently wounded, Reinoehl began moving away from the officers on foot.
Officers continued to fire, and as Reinoehl stepped into the street from behind a nearby truck, a final burst took him down, Brady said. He most likely died immediately, said the Thurston County coroner, Gary Warnock.
Officers also offered conflicting accounts of those final shots. One said that Reinoehl, while in the street, pointed a gun. Other officers said that he appeared to be trying to “retrieve” one from his pants pocket.
As they searched Reinoehl’s body, officers found the gun, Brady said. It was still in his pocket.
The aftermath
In all, four officers fired about 30 rounds from two rifles and two handguns, Brady said.
A visit to the scene by a reporter, as well as videos and photos from the aftermath, showed that at least eight of the officers’ bullets struck civilian property.
Angel Romero, who lives directly adjacent to the shooting, said at least five bullets hit a brick wall and a wooden fence at his home. One traveled through an exterior wall and passed above his dog kennels and through his dining room — narrowly missing his brother before lodging in a kitchen wall. Romero’s neighbor found a smashed bullet in his backyard grass.
“They literally found ricochet bullets where my kid was,” Louis said.
Brady said it would be several months before lab results determined whether the shell casing found in the Volkswagen matched the handgun found in Reinoehl’s pocket, and it may never be known whether it was fired that day. There is no evidence that Reinoehl touched the rifle found in the bag in his car, the chief investigator said.
None of the officers said they saw Reinoehl fire his handgun, and investigators have found no other evidence that suggests he did. Investigators found no .380 bullets or casings outside the vehicle.
In the aftermath, some news accounts quoted witnesses describing Reinoehl firing shots. One of them, Smith, said he was misquoted. Another woman also described Reinoehl firing shots, but in another account said that she was not present when the shooting began. Cutler said he heard a pistol that he thought might have been Reinoehl’s firing first, but Brady said the officers fired pistols as well as rifles.
Six minutes after the shooting started, Jashon Spencer, a resident of the apartment complex, began filming a live video from the scene. In it, roughly 8 1/2 minutes after Reinoehl was likely killed, an officer could be seen beginning chest compressions on Reinoehl’s motionless body. They were undertaken almost perfunctorily, from a standing position, and soon ended.

SEATTLE — Protesters in Portland, Oregon, swept through the city Sunday night, toppling statues of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt and damaging the entrance to the Oregon Historical Society in a demonstration against colonization and the treatment of Native Americans.
Protests around the country this year have mainly targeted statues featuring slave owners and symbols of the Confederacy, but the demonstrators in Portland focused on the 1920s statues of the former presidents as part of a protest billed as an “Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage.”
President Donald Trump seized on the toppling of the statues Monday morning, citing the destruction as a reason to vote for him next month. “The Radical Left fools in Portland don’t want any help from real Law Enforcement which we will provide instantaneously,” he wrote on Twitter. “Vote!”
Lincoln has long been celebrated as the president who brought an end to slavery in the United States, but the protesters sprayed the base of his statue in Portland with “Dakota 38” — a reference to the largest mass execution in U.S. history, in which 38 Dakota Indians were hanged in 1862, accused of killing settlers in raids.
Lincoln had signed the execution order. He had also expressed worry about the rapid speed and lack of evidence presented at military tribunals that led to the death sentences; he commuted the sentences of 265 others.
Roosevelt has been scrutinized over his opinions about racial hierarchy and his role in the Spanish-American War. He endorsed eugenics proposals. He was quoted as saying it would be better if almost all Native Americans were dead.
Mayor Ted Wheeler was among those who criticized Sunday’s destruction. He was joined at a news conference by Tawna D. Sanchez, a Native American state legislator who lives in Portland. She said that those who want to change the city’s statues could do that through city processes.
“We don’t have to do it by tearing things down, because it’s not helping,” she said.
Statues have remained an area of focus around the country. In Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Monday, protesters toppled an obelisk that was inscribed to honor people who died battling “savage” Indians.
Protests in Portland have persisted in the months since Minneapolis police officers killed George Floyd in May, sparking nationwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality. While much of the focus of demonstrations has been on how Black people have been harmed, the protests have at times highlighted other causes, including the need for societal reforms to address transgender rights, economic disparities and Native Americans.
On Sunday night, journalists in Portland reported that crowds had smashed windows and spray-painted graffiti at other locations, including the Oregon Historical Society and several businesses. The Portland police later declared the gathering a riot and dispersed the crowd, making three arrests.
One of the people arrested was driving a van suspected of helping pull down the Roosevelt statue, the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office said Monday. Prosecutors said that person, Brandon Bartells, has been charged with damaging a historic statue.
Kerry Tymchuk, the executive director of the historical society, said the items inside the society’s building were left untouched, except for a quilt sewn by a group of Black women over the course of three years in the 1970s. The quilt was removed from the building by protesters and was later found several blocks away. It was “very wet” — probably as a result of the rain — but Tymchuk said he hoped it could be put on display again.
Trump, who is seeking to make a law-and-order case for reelection, has repeatedly highlighted unrest in Portland. On Monday, he sent a series of tweets about the Portland statues, calling the protesters “animals” and calling for the FBI to help contain them.
“Portland, call in the Feds!” he tweeted.
The deployment of federal agents to crack down on Portland protesters this year drew thousands of demonstrators into the street for nightly clashes in front of the federal courthouse. That came after Trump directed federal agencies to deploy additional personnel to protect statues, monuments and federal property. After state and federal officials came to an agreement to pull back federal agents, the protests have waned in size.
Sunday’s gathering included about 200 people.

WASHINGTON — The White House physician has not released any update about President Donald Trump’s health since Thursday, nor has the White House made public the results of his latest coronavirus test, which he claims he took Friday.
But Trump, eager to prove he has fully recovered a week after being hospitalized for COVID-19, appeared briefly Saturday in front of hundreds of chanting supporters gathered at the White House.
“We’ve got to vote these people into oblivion,” Trump said, reentering the arena with his signature bluster and without any acknowledgment that he might still be contagious to those around him. His short speech, delivered from the Blue Room balcony overlooking the South Lawn, was the first time he has been seen in public since leaving the hospital Monday. (A television interview with Fox News that aired Friday night had been pretaped.)
Trump, who emerged wearing a white surgical mask, peeled it off as he began his remarks. His voice sounded strong, and his aggressive message playing down the threat of the virus was unchanged. But the event that the White House had previewed as a huge “peaceful protest for law and order” was uncharacteristically brief.
White House officials said the president would speak for 30 minutes, but he kept his remarks to just 18 minutes in total. A typical Trump rally, in contrast, often runs for at least 90 minutes. A large bandage on top of his right hand was a reminder of the treatments and infusions he has received over the past week. And atypical for a president who usually keeps his crowds waiting, Trump started right on time.
“We cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation,” Trump said, as he tried to infuse his campaign with urgency in the final weeks before Election Day. “We cannot let that happen. That’s what would happen. Or worse.”
One White House official said that about 2,000 invitations had been sent out. But the crowd Saturday was made up of a few hundred attendees, many of whom were in town for a gathering of the so-called Blexit movement, started by right-wing firebrand Candace Owens, which encourages Black voters to leave the Democratic Party.
Attendees were asked to fill out questionnaires and undergo temperature screenings before entering the White House complex. They were also advised to wear masks, although many in the audience did not follow those directions.
Some White House advisers did not, either. Dr. Scott Atlas, the commentator whose views playing down the threat of the coronavirus have been solicited by Trump, was seen standing about 20 feet from the crowd with no face covering. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, was wearing a mask, but his presence in the West Wing on a Saturday was unexpected because he is an observant Jew who has told people he does not typically work on the Sabbath. It was another reminder of how many of the president’s senior advisers have tested positive and are still recovering in quarantine.
The gathering Saturday was not a campaign event, White House officials said, although most attendees wore “Make America Great Again” red caps, and the president’s speech was filled with attacks against his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.
“Sleepy Joe Biden’s betrayed Black and Latino Americans,” Trump said, as part of his attempt to win over more than the 8% of Black voters he won four years ago.
In late August, Trump also spoke at the Republican National Convention on the South Lawn, delivering his acceptance speech for the nomination in front of the same balcony where he stood Saturday, continuing to play down the virus despite its entry into his own orbit.
“It’s going to disappear,” he said Saturday, after underscoring recent “flare-ups” in other countries. He added that “the therapeutics are going to help a lot” and claimed, without evidence, that a vaccine was coming out “very, very quickly.”
The appearance came as Trump is scheduled to hold his first campaign event Monday in Sanford, Florida, with events in Pennsylvania and other parts of Florida set for later in the week.
For days, Trump has been pressing advisers to let him resume campaigning, and the White House event Saturday was a compromise from advisers who wanted to delay the president’s reentry on the campaign trail.
The gathering was also the latest effort by the president to show he was not as sick as news outlets, including The New York Times, reported last weekend, when he was said to have been administered supplemental oxygen. In a Fox News interview Friday, Trump denied that he had experienced any trouble breathing and said he was no longer taking any medications.
In several phone calls last weekend from the presidential suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Trump shared an idea he was considering: When he left the hospital, he wanted to appear frail at first when people saw him, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. But underneath his button-down dress shirt, he would wear a Superman T-shirt, which he would reveal as a symbol of strength when he ripped open the top layer. He ultimately did not go ahead with the stunt.
At the White House on Saturday, Trump took note of the teal blue shirts the attendees wore, pointed to the crowd and said, “I want to put one of them on instead of a white shirt.”
And he implored his Black and Latino supporters to focus on the damage caused by unrest in cities across the country. “The homes and churches and businesses of Black Americans have been looted,” Trump said. “You know that.”

A Surging Virus. Angry Packers Fans. Can Trump Hold On to Wisconsin?

You know the story well: Not a single public poll in 2016 showed Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin, and forecasters suggested he had almost no shot. FiveThirtyEight gave him less than a one-in-six chance of winning the state.
But after the votes were counted, with turnout down in key Democratic areas, Trump eked out a victory by fewer than 30,000 votes.
This year, again, virtually every poll has shown the Democrat, Joe Biden, with at least a slight edge over Trump. A New York Times/Siena College survey last month gave Biden a 5-percentage-point advantage among likely voters. Polls taken since then by CNN and NBC News/Marist College have each given Biden an outright, 10-point lead.
And with the coronavirus now raging in Wisconsin, particularly in the politically competitive northeastern region, Trump faces an uphill battle toward repeating his victory from four years ago.
“Certainly, with the sharp rise in cases here, it’s on the agenda for voters,” said Charles Franklin, a political scientist who runs the Marquette Law School poll, which is seen as the definitive political survey in the state. “His handling of COVID does appear to be having a bigger effect on people’s vote than either the economy or his handling of the protests.”
Marquette has released a Wisconsin poll each month since June, and in every one Biden has held a single-digit lead among likely voters that was within the margin of error. This reflects the steadiness of a race in which Wisconsinites largely know where they stand: Roughly 4 in 5 voters have consistently expressed a strong opinion of Trump’s leadership, whether positive or negative, according to Marquette’s data.
But if there are any small signs of momentum, it appears to be breaking Biden’s way. His 48% approval rating in the poll released this week was his best in a Marquette survey all year, capping a 14-point rise since February. Trump, meanwhile, was seen positively by 42% of Wisconsin voters, leaving his net favorability rating more than 10 points in the red, where it has languished since June.
Concern about the pandemic has ticked upward recently. More than 6 in 10 Wisconsin voters in the Marquette poll described themselves as at least fairly worried — including 27% who said they were very worried, up from 21% last month. Fully 50% of Wisconsin voters said they did not expect the virus to be under control for at least another year, running counter to Trump’s insistence that it is already being handled effectively.
And that’s not the only issue where he’s hurting. While Trump has made Wisconsin a focal point of his “law and order” messaging, particularly after protests broke out over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 54% of Wisconsin voters said in the Marquette survey that they disapproved of how he had handled this year’s unrest. Just 37% approved.
Republicans’ Rise Among White Men Without College Degrees
Since the rise of the tea party movement a decade ago, white men without college degrees in Wisconsin have shifted toward the Republican Party in large numbers — a development that predated Trump’s rise, but that he certainly accelerated. Franklin cited Marquette numbers showing that in 2012, non-college-educated white men in Wisconsin were just 5 points more likely to be Republicans than Democrats. By this year, the difference had grown to 23 points.
Franklin said that former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, had introduced a newly working-class political lexicon in the early 2010s, when he waged an attack on public-sector unions.
“Walker didn’t spend as much time emphasizing pro-business messages in a way that you would’ve heard previous generations of Republicans saying, ‘What’s good for business is good for the state,’” Franklin said. “Walker was saying: ‘They’re hardworking taxpayers who need their money, and these unions are taking money from them.’”
But as much as Republicans’ appeals have resonated with many working-class white men, there has not been commensurate movement among women without college degrees. And while Democrats haven’t notched big gains in their vote share among any particular group, they have avoided losing ground among demographics that are growing more quickly — such as college graduates, Latinos and voters in cities.
In Democratic strongholds like Milwaukee and Madison, the state’s two biggest municipalities, the margins actually improved slightly for Democrats between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Dane County, which includes Madison, is the state’s fastest-growing county, and is probably the No. 1 area where Democrats will be looking to run up the score.
And with Wisconsin’s heavily white population growing older, thanks to the aging of the baby boom generation, Trump’s underperformance among voters 65 and older in polls this year could help Biden across the state.
The Virus Hits the Gridiron
Green Bay, a heavily blue-collar city in the northeastern part of the state, has been in the news recently as the coronavirus has surged. The Packers, the town’s beloved NFL team, announced this week that for the time being no fans would be allowed to attend games at Lambeau Field. Data released by the NFL Players Association at the end of last month showed that Green Bay had a higher rate of infection than any other team’s market.
For Trump, all of this puts an unwelcome focus on the coronavirus in the most politically volatile region of the state.
“Green Bay, Appleton and other cities in that region have moved pretty noticeably in a Democratic direction since 2010,” Franklin said. “The surrounding counties in the region, though, have stayed very Republican, and to the north and west of Green Bay have become even more Republican than before. So the result is, the whole region is still pretty competitive.”
Brown County, which includes Green Bay, broke for Trump by 9 points in 2016, but with Biden turning back Trump’s advantage among suburbanites and building his support among the urban Democratic base, it could be up for grabs this year.
Turnout Helps Democrats — and Pollsters?
Overall, Wisconsin’s population is almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, but there’s still a slight Democratic tilt to the electorate, especially when voter engagement is high, since Democrats tend to do better among demographics with lower turnout.
And this year, signs are pointing to what could be a historically high level of participation. Seventy-five percent of registered voters said they were certain to cast a ballot, according to the latest Marquette poll, compared with 71% on the eve of the 2016 election. And official statistics on requests for absentee ballots suggest that if anything, voters are even more engaged than they’re telling pollsters.
“In our data, about 33% say they’re going to vote absentee by mail — but election officials have already sent out 1.2 million ballots,” Franklin said, referring to ballots mailed to voters who have expressly requested them. “That would give us about 36% of the total registered voters, so that would be a little over what we have in our polling data, though not out of line with it.”
State estimates suggest that Wisconsinites could cast upward of 3.1 million ballots this year, for the first time in history.
A high-turnout election would most likely lift Democrats — but it could help pollsters too. In 2016, a late break toward Trump, combined with unexpectedly low participation among Democratic voters, threw the state to him.
Unlike some researchers in other states, Marquette’s team in 2016 made sure to weight its data by education levels, and it did not significantly underestimate Trump’s strength among white voters without degrees. But what did surprise Franklin that year was Trump’s success in the suburbs, which he won by 16 points, according to Wisconsin exit polls.
This year, however, Biden’s lead over Trump among suburbanites has been steady and strong: Marist’s most recent poll of Wisconsin put him up by 12 points in the suburbs — and on handling the coronavirus, suburban voters chose Biden over the president by 22 points.

Yelp, the local search and review site, said it would post alerts on the pages of businesses where customers or employees have reported incidents of racism, the latest attempt by a U.S. company to introduce a tougher response system to confront discrimination after the police killing of George Floyd in May.
The company, which offers a platform for users to rate places like restaurants, small businesses and popular tourist sites, said in a statement Thursday that it would use a “business accused of racist behavior” alert when there was “resounding evidence” that a business owner or employee had taken racist actions, including the use of racist slurs or symbols. This alert will always link to a news article from a “credible media outlet,” Yelp said, without elaborating on which news organizations they considered to be credible or how it defined “resounding evidence.”
So far, the alert has been placed on “a couple of” business pages, a Yelp spokesperson said.
Yelp’s announcement raised questions about how the company will enforce the initiative — and how it will ensure that businesses were not falsely associated with racism or the target of defamatory reviews, which can significantly damage a business. Companies like Google and Facebook have also grappled with the difficult issues of moderating users on their online platforms.
“As the nation reckons with issues of systemic racism, we’ve seen in the last few months that there is a clear need to warn consumers about businesses associated with egregious, racially-charged actions to help people make more informed spending decisions,” said the statement from Yelp, which is based in San Francisco.
The company has already rolled out a lower-level “public attention” alert that flags businesses whose staff members have been accused of racism toward customers or who have been the target of racism by managers. Yelp is, on a daily basis, alerted about discrimination at local businesses across the country, including in towns where the incidents may not make the news, the spokesperson said Friday.
The spokesperson added that if, following a reported racist incident, a business has fired the offending employee or taken other corrective steps, the “business accused of racist behavior” alert could be downgraded to a “public attention” alert.
Yelp’s initiative aims to help its customers find businesses that align with their values, a factor of increasing importance to users, the company said, citing a 617% increase in reviews mentioning Black-owned businesses this summer compared with last summer.
Yelp has waded into issues of social justice before. In 2017, the company said it added a feature so users could filter results by the availability of gender-neutral bathrooms. The site invites users and business owners to identify places that offer single-stall bathrooms available to people of any sex.
In recent years, crowdsourced review sites like Yelp have grappled with how to effectively moderate posts so that bogus reviews and misleading news articles do not unfairly hurt businesses.
In one example in 2018, diners at a popular New York City restaurant emptied out in the hours after HuffPost published an article saying that the restaurant owner’s sister was a firebrand Twitter user who frequently attacked Islam. The owner’s wife said at the time that she and her husband had little contact with her sister-in-law and that her views did not in any way represent theirs or the business.
Still, the restaurant received vitriol from the right and the left on Twitter, Facebook and in one-star reviews on Yelp.
The Yelp spokesperson said that if the company received an unusual uptick in reviews at a business, an automated signal would be sent to a team of moderators who would alert customers that recent reviews may not be based on firsthand experiences. She declined to comment on how many moderators the company had.
Some users welcomed the new initiative, calling it a welcome attempt to root out racism. Others, including figures on the right like Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, warned that the policy had potential for misuse. “What are the odds that this isn’t insanely abused?” he wrote on Twitter.
Reception was mixed from businesses, too. Simon Duchon, a supervisor at the Britannia, a pub in London, said he welcomed the initiative because it could hold businesses accountable for racist or discriminatory conduct. But he also warned about the possibility for abuse — and the prospect that a Yelp notice could continue to harm businesses even after they had taken steps to address racist incidents.
Earlier this year, a customer complained about being called a racist slur by a manager at the pub, but the incident actually happened at a different establishment. Management reported the comment to Yelp, but the complaint still exists on the company’s page.
“I think in many ways it’s a very good idea, but one negative comment can destroy a whole business,” he said.

NEW YORK — For Mona Chalabi, 33, a Brooklyn-based artist and illustrator, data has been a special kind of solace during the pandemic.
“Let’s say I’m really freaking out about COVID — I’ll remind myself of what the case rate is per 100,000 residents rather than looking at these overall numbers,” she said in a recent interview over Zoom. Parsing through numbers and turning them into something that people could easily understand, and even find comfort in, has always been Chalabi’s method.
Her latest artwork, presented by Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and on view through Nov. 30 in the Westfield World Trade Center, is titled “100 New Yorkers.” It uses census data to depict the racial, social and economic diversity of the city. In one corner, people crowd around a hot dog cart. In another, a man sits on a piece of cardboard with a cup, asking for change. A majority of the characters are people of color, from all walks of life.
“I am trying to show the population of this city in a way that allows that same population to feel seen in the data,” said Chalabi, who is originally from London. “I hope that when you pass those 100 characters, you see yourself.”
Chalabi is also not afraid to get more political in her work. This summer, a few weeks into nationwide protests against police brutality, Chalabi posted a bar graph on Instagram that served as a reminder of the length of some of the most consequential civil rights protests in history — from the Greensboro sit-ins (176 days) to the Montgomery bus boycott (382 days). “I’m energized for the long days ahead,” she wrote in the caption.
At the time of our conversation, Chalabi was on the last day of a self-imposed quarantine. A few weeks earlier, she had traveled to London to visit her mother, and Chalabi shut herself in her apartment as soon as she returned to New York. Normally, Chalabi would be skateboarding at basketball courts (something she picked up in summer camp where, as she tells it, it was just her “and a bunch of boys”), but when we spoke, she had spent much of her time indoors, watching TV, drawing and dealing with her landlord.
“Maybe hearing about my days at home is going to be boring or maybe it’s going to be an accurate depiction of most of our lives,” Chalabi said, in true self-deprecating British form. These are edited excerpts from our conversation.
Sunday Morning
I woke up and felt horrible, I felt so anxious. My landlord has threatened me with eviction, which is really stressful. But if I’m not going to live here, then where?
I don’t think London is home anymore. And I also feel scared about leaving this country because this is where I built my career, and if I were to leave, can I sustain my career? I’m sick of these four walls but I can’t imagine another four that I would be happy in.
After getting out of bed, I just got into my routine with work. For better or for worse, it really is the thing that gets me out of my head. The act of concentrating takes me away from whatever else it is I’m worried about.
Sunday Afternoon
I’m taking a screenwriting class at the moment with a friend of mine. So at 2 p.m. we both logged on for that.
There are 20 other people in the class and obviously they don’t know that my friend and I already know each other, so sometimes it feels like we’re back in school, texting on the side while the class is going on, being like, “Oh my God, Brad just won’t stop biting his fingernails.”
Then I binge-watched the entirety of “The Duchess” by Katherine Ryan. I know it has taken her a long time to get to the point where she’s able to write a scripted show on Netflix, and it paid off. I think the show is fantastic. It was just really great to be cheerleading as you’re watching.
Monday Morning
I’m in the process of pitching a book, so on Monday I had three calls with different publishers. I think the first call went really badly. I went to drink some of my coffee and just completely poured it down me. And no one on the call said anything, so I was like, “OK, I guess I’m just going to have coffee all over me for the rest of this call, but also could you please give me money?”
I also had a call with TED because I’m working on a podcast with them that will basically do what I do — use data to answer questions.
Monday Evening
At 5 p.m., I came back out (of the bathroom) to find my landlord in my apartment. Sometimes she just walks in, which is another reason why I’d like to move. So, I had a bit of a tête-à-tête with her.
And then, at about 8 p.m., I started watching TV. I only recently discovered that I hate watching new things because I don’t know what’s going to happen and it stresses me out. So I’ve just been watching “Succession” over and over. I think I’ve watched it seven times now. Also, I’m always using my ex’s login whenever I go onto HBO. Every single time I do it I’m like, “I shouldn’t be doing this.”
I also just finished reading “Moms” by Yeong-shin Ma. It’s a graphic novel about a bunch of women in their early 50s that I thought was really, really beautiful.
Tuesday Afternoon
I had a phone call with Rebecca Carroll — a WNYC journalist who has a podcast called “Come Through.” I kind of wish I hadn’t done it because she asked me what my most memorable moment of the year was and I started crying really hysterically. I was talking about a Black woman in the U.K. who worked as a transport worker and a white dude said to her, “I’ve got COVID,” and then spat on her. Then she, in fact, contracted COVID and died and left behind her [child]. I had just been thinking about that series of events so much and, at that point, it was my first time saying it out loud. To say it out loud was quite upsetting.
Tuesday Evening
I just continued working. I usually work up until dinner and then, after I have dinner, the only work that I will do is the illustrations or photo editing stuff because it requires less brain power.
In my six years in New York, I can honestly say I think I’ve cooked about 10 times. So now I’ve started cooking begrudgingly and the stuff I make is absolutely disgusting. My fantastic recipes have included a vegetarian sausage with a salad or two pieces of toast with a salad or instant noodles.
But I think I finally do understand, a little bit, the catharsis of just chopping. It’s a lot like illustrating — doing something with your hands is quite comforting.

Election Officials Are Preparing for Potential Unrest at the Polls

The day after last week’s presidential debate, the phones began to ring at the clerk’s office in Ada County, Idaho, with a handful of residents worried about their safety at the polls. Election officials hastily added training for poll workers on what to do if someone shows up armed.
In Orange County, California, law enforcement officers have been given pocket cards detailing the criminal codes on voting disruption, and election personnel have been trained to monitor police radio dispatches for reports of problems at the polls.
In a dozen battleground states, the NAACP has thousands of volunteers preparing to monitor voting lines, all to encourage anyone facing harassment to stay in line and to aggressively use social media to amplify their reports. Another group is taking the unusual step of training volunteers to physically block intimidators.
As early voting accelerates across the nation, election experts say that President Donald Trump’s recent statements, emboldened extremist groups and the coronavirus pandemic have combined to create a tension around casting ballots not seen since the Jim Crow era, when civil rights activists were forced to pry open polling places in the South.
“I would have my head in the sand if I didn’t tell you there is not more amplified noise this year,” said Neal Kelley, the Orange County election registrar. “This is the most intense I have seen in 17 years in this job.”
Trump has sought to enlist both the full force of the federal government and some state government allies into his efforts to sow discord around the election, falsely insisting that mail-in voting is rife with fraud, cheering on the construction of new barriers to voting and encouraging supporters to monitor polls, possibly with the threat of violence.
The president’s confirmed case of coronavirus infection and his potential absence from the campaign trail inject even more uncertainty into the final days before the vote.
Trump’s own government has predicted potential unrest as Election Day approaches.
“Open-air, publicly accessible parts of physical election infrastructure, such as campaign-associated mass gatherings, polling places and voter registration events, would be the most likely flash points for potential violence,” according to an annual threat assessment from the Department of Homeland Security issued Tuesday.
Protecting voters from harassment at the polls can be complicated by local and federal laws as well as issues of free speech: One person’s voluble enthusiasm is another’s intimidation. Each state also has its own rules about how close to polling stations protesters and campaign volunteers may stand, but those buffer zones are proving to be less protective than in the past, as social distancing has lengthened voting lines.
And other methods to defending polling sites from disruption could be trickier to carry out, especially during a pandemic.
Election officials cannot crowd voters indoors, even to get them away from protesters, when that could expose them to coronavirus infection. They could fortify polling sites with law enforcement officials, but that carries its own risk: In some locations, especially those frequented by minority voters, police officers may also be viewed as intimidating.
Those challenges came into focus last month when a group of Trump supporters chanting, “Four more years,” disrupted voters at a polling location in Fairfax, Virginia, forcing officials at the site to allow the group of voters to wait inside.
But that presented its own problems. Gary Scott, the general registrar of Fairfax County, said the pandemic had further complicated their planning for what he described as the “most contentious” election he had worked in more than 20 years.
After the incident in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, Scott said Fairfax County decided it would direct demonstrators to stay 150 feet away from the facility, even farther than the 40-feet buffer required under state law. But that has not quelled concerns that voters could be in proximity to potential aggressors, particularly as they are directed to social distance while in line to vote.
“People are out actively stirring the pot,” Scott said. “There’s a lot of disinformation being disseminated all across the spectrum, and that creates a level of anxiety on voters.”
Scott said his team was meeting with police before the election to consider new security protocols. Officials had private security on hand at the polling place where Trump supporters caused a disruption even before that episode. Such efforts are proliferating around the country, as officials are taking the threat seriously.
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have begun exercises with local law enforcement groups and election officials around the nation. After participating in one tabletop exercise, David Maeda, a top election official for the Minnesota secretary of state’s office, called his county administrators to ensure they were in contact with their sheriffs and were marking the 100-foot buffer around polling stations. Maeda is even recommending poll workers attend a roll call at the local police station to make clear the needs of their polling stations.
Steve Descano, Fairfax County’s prosecutor, has created a team in his office that will soon be trained on the tactics of militia groups. He said the chances of another incident like the one at the polling station in Fairfax were more likely after Trump called for his supporters to independently monitor polling places during his debate with Joe Biden.
“I told my wife we’re going to have more problems,” Descano said. “I’m a realist. I always hoped we wouldn’t have problems, but I have to plan on it.”
In Weber County, Utah, election officials are running exercises to prepare for “worst-case scenarios” of protesters blocking access to polling places.
“Once in a while, you get someone who’s just hot and heavy,” said Ricky Hatch, the county clerk and auditor there.
A slew of groups like the NAACP are also planning to help protect voters by gearing up lawyers and recruiting volunteers to watch for provocations and, if needed, escort voters into their polling place, much like some women get help to enter abortion clinics past protest lines.
“We are training folks to be prepared to deal with provocateurs,” said Ría Thompson-Washington, with the Center for Popular Democracy, even if that means, despite the pandemic, “putting their body between them.” She added, “Usually you would advise them to not engage and divert attention.”
The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a voting rights group, has increased its volunteers from 500 to more than 1,200.
“We are in high alert in Virginia and George and Kentucky,” said Kristen Clarke, the group’s executive director. “We know this is an unprecedented election.”
Groups that sponsor voter protection programs warn that having a uniformed police presence at polling sites may actually deter voters.
“This is a case where the last thing we want is for law enforcement to show up,” said Kat Calvin, founder of Spread The Vote. “I don’t know if we necessarily are in a country in a climate where we can trust that people would feel like they’re being protected.”
In a recent conference call organized by the National Association of Counties, Michael Vu, the registrar of voters in San Diego County, California, said that local officials needed to “strike a balance between free expression and public safety during the pandemic.”
As Election Day draws closer, officials in many counties say they are ready to manage that balance.
“I am relatively optimistic,” said Phil McGrane, the county clerk in Ada County. “I’d like to think our community is less likely to experience violence, but it is certainly one more thing we are adding to the list.”

In Louisville, Looking to Protests of the Past to Move Forward

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — They gathered near the banks of the Ohio River last weekend, about 100 deep, and began marching toward downtown, belting out chants that have become part of the city’s soundtrack.
“Bre-on-na Tay-lor!” “I love being Black!”
When they reached Jefferson Square Park, where protesters have held vigil since late May, the demonstrators lit candles, laid flowers and offered words that were by turns meant to soothe and to rally.
“Louisville has always responded to get justice,” said Raoul Cunningham, 77, president of the city’s branch of the NAACP, who participated in sit-ins in 1961 that helped lead to the integration of commercial businesses. “I think today’s demonstrations are a continuation or even an advancement of that quest,” he said.
As activists work to chart a path forward after prosecutors announced that the two Louisville police officers who fatally shot Breonna Taylor would not be charged, some are drawing on the city’s past to help guide them. Louisville has a robust, if overlooked, history of civil rights struggle that has spanned generations. Many see what is happening today as a continuation of that legacy.
During the civil rights movement, Louisville was a regular stop for Martin Luther King Jr., whose brother served as a pastor in the city. There were sit-ins, pickets and marches that led to landmark victories: It was the first major city in the South to pass local civil rights and fair housing ordinances, and it was the rare Southern city to peacefully integrate its schools after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling.
The 1970s brought a violent clash over the use of busing to integrate schools. In the ’80s there was so much labor unrest that Louisville became known as Strike City.
In the nearly two weeks since the prosecution’s announcement, the street rallies have shrunk and the national news media has largely left. But marches are still happening nearly every night, as they have been for more than four months. An array of new activist organizations grew out of the response, created in part by many young people protesting for the first time. Together with legacy civil rights groups, they are pressing Taylor’s case on several fronts — advocating for legal consequences for the officers, public awareness, and state and local legislative changes.
The city is working to create a civilian oversight board that is stronger than the one currently overseeing the Police Department.
A local ordinance, known as “Breonna’s Law,” was passed banning no-knock warrants and expanding the requirements for the use of police body cameras. Attica Scott, a state representative, is sponsoring similar legislation at the state level that would also allow lawsuits against officials who violate a person’s civil rights, and would require drug and alcohol testing for officers after fatal encounters.
Scott, the lone Black woman in the state Legislature, said her parents, born in Louisville in the 1950s, had activism on their minds when she was born: She is named for the prison in upstate New York where inmates protested against inhumane conditions, she said.
Scott described growing up in a household where she saw her mother work to make sure that families could get affordable housing and where her parents supported the Black Panthers.
“Activism and social justice is at our core,” she said of Louisville residents. “That is who we are.”
Scott became a labor organizer in the city, and when she went to meetings and demonstrations, she would sometimes bring her daughter, Ashanti, in tow. Ashanti was about 8 when she accompanied her mother to a protest for increased wages and better conditions for retail workers. That stuck with her.
“It really showed me the importance of showing up, putting your body out there on the line, standing with your community,” Ashanti Scott, now 19, said. “And how vital that is to have your voice, whether it’s leading chants or following chants — that is some of the most important work.”
And so in late May, when she saw images of raucous downtown protests on social media, when she read the details of the killing of Taylor, who, like her, was young, Black and from Louisville, Scott knew she had no choice. She had to take to the streets.
In the months since, Scott has become one of the many first-time activists helping to sustain the movement. She goes to the downtown square, tweets about the case and protests about four times a week, she said.
She said she took inspiration, and saw something of a road map, from the past battles that Black people in Louisville fought — like the push to integrate Fontaine Ferry Park, an amusement park, on the West End, or the boycotts that helped to desegregate businesses.
Those efforts taught her to use protests to highlight injustice, she said, “so we can end it and get policy changes to keep Black people in Louisville secure in their homes and their communities.”
In the mid-20th century, Louisville was the stop for trains coming from the North where Black passengers had to move to the “colored cars” before continuing their southward journey, said Tracy E. K’Meyer, a historian at the University of Louisville and the author of “Civil Rights in the Gateway to the South.” But it also was the place where organized labor as well as liberal churches helped to produce a civil rights movement that was relatively interracial for its time.
“One of the things the ’60s era sort of bequeathed to us is a sort of playbook for activism,” K’Meyer said. “Some of my younger students, especially some of my more radical younger students, will say, ‘We’re not like them. We’re different from what they did back in the ’60s,’ while doing pretty much exactly what they did back in the ’60s.”
Some older movement leaders say that the younger generation has shown less patience at times, and that the current activist efforts can seem chaotic.
Shameka Parrish-Wright, a co-chair of the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, has been helping to guide some of the younger activists.
“They’re still reacting,” Parrish-Wright, 43, said. “They’re still processing and they’re doing it out loud .”
Parrish-Wright helped to set up the encampment in the downtown square — which activists now call Injustice Square Park — in late May when protesters began flooding the streets of Louisville. Taylor was killed in March at age 26, but her case only started receiving national attention in May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The 40-year-old Alliance runs its operations out of the two-story Craftsman home where one of its founders, Anne Braden, who was white and died in 2006, lived in Louisville’s predominantly Black West End. Inside the home there is a clutter of cases of water and other supplies donated to support the protesters. Large yellow sheets of paper propped on an easel have lists of protest “demands” and “wins,” such as the ban on no-knock warrants.
Protesters have said they want more to come out of this moment, but as they continue to push, activists are encountering resistant public officials and internal disagreements that threaten to thwart their efforts.
On a Saturday evening last month, after one of the largest marches of the week, hundreds of demonstrators milled about Jefferson Square Park, looking for direction. What they got instead was a power struggle.
Some organizers urged the marchers to sit in the square past the city’s 9 p.m. curfew to force the Police Department’s hand in deciding whether to arrest peaceful demonstrators. Others wanted them to take sanctuary at a nearby church and feared that police would destroy a memorial to Taylor in the square.
The group ultimately splintered. The remaining protesters ended up at the church, where arguments ensued over what to do next.
The following evening, with dozens gathered back at the church, Chris Wells, 31, an activist working to create his own organization, sought to patch any lingering wounds.
“I love y’all,” he told a crowd gathered around him. “We’re going to keep marching, keep stepping, but we’re going to do it together as one.”

For two years, New Jersey lawmakers had failed to mobilize enough support to pass a bill to fully legalize marijuana. Instead, they agreed in December to put the question directly to voters: “Do you approve amending the Constitution to legalize a controlled form of marijuana called ‘cannabis’?”
Then March roared in and the world turned upside down.
The coronavirus took a firm hold in the United States and Black Lives Matter protesters filled streets from coast to coast.
More than 16,000 New Jersey residents have since died from the virus. Unemployment has soared. Ballots for November’s election, which is being conducted almost entirely by mail, have already begun to arrive at voters’ homes.
And a dominant conversation in the nation now centers on race and policing, giving a core argument among supporters of legalization new potency in a state where Black residents are more than three times as likely as white residents to be charged with marijuana possession.
“The big thing that’s changed,” said Axel Owen, campaign manager for NJ Can 2020, a coalition that supports legalization, “is people are having a discussion about the role of policing.”
A Monmouth University poll in April found that 64% of New Jersey voters supported legalizing the possession of marijuana for personal use; 61% of respondents said they intended to vote “yes” on November’s ballot question.
The use of marijuana for approved medical conditions is legal in 33 states, including New Jersey.
In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to make it legal to smoke marijuana recreationally, without a medical justification. Nine additional states and Washington, D.C., have since legalized adult use of marijuana, and New Jersey is one of four states where voters will be asked in November if they support legalizing recreational use of the drug. Arizona, Montana and South Dakota have similar ballot initiatives.
If voters approve all four, 1 in 3 Americans will live in a state or city where recreational use of marijuana is legal, even before federal legislation advances.
“We’ve seen this complete evolution in thinking,” said Steven Hawkins, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, a nonprofit that supports legalization. “New Jersey is one of the bluest states in the nation and South Dakota is one of the reddest — and they both have ballot initiatives in November.”
Opponents say they fear the long-term effects of the drug, its potent levels of THC — the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana — and the potential glut of licensed distributors in struggling cities.
Still, they are facing strong headwinds at a time when the nation is focused on police killings of Black residents that have shined a spotlight on systemic bias. What was once an argument centered mainly on the bottom-line benefits of taxing and regulating a product widely in use has been reframed as one with equity — and the disproportionate rates of arrest in minority neighborhoods — at its heart.
If approved, New Jersey — densely populated and bordered by states that have not legalized marijuana, New York and Pennsylvania — is expected to quickly become one of the biggest new cannabis markets in the country. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat and a proponent of legalization, argues that expanding the industry is a smart way to help the state rebound from the long-term financial devastation of the pandemic.
“You have the bridge, two tunnels,” said Joseph Casper, manager of a medical marijuana dispensary in Montclair, New Jersey, about the state’s proximity to New York. “People are just going to be shooting back and forth all day.”
Curaleaf, the world’s largest cannabis company, operates a medicinal marijuana dispensary in South Jersey and was just licensed to open a second outlet in the state.
Joe Bayern, the company’s president, says Curaleaf is building a 100,000-square-foot grow facility in Winslow, New Jersey, with an eye toward being able to quickly pivot into the adult-use market if the ballot initiative passes.
“We need more capacity,” Bayern said. “There’s going to be a quantum leap in consumption and it takes time to prepare, to be ready for that.”
Demand for medical marijuana in New Jersey has never been higher.
Customers at the state’s nine dispensaries frequently find long lines and limited selection of the drug, which sells for about $400 to $500 an ounce, according to dispensary owners, managers and clients. There were nearly 200 applicants for 24 new dispensary licenses in the state’s latest round of bids.
A research arm of the state Legislature has estimated that taxes on sales of recreational-use marijuana could generate about $126 million a year once the market is established; groups in favor of legalization say the revenue would likely be far higher. Municipalities would also be permitted to charge cannabis businesses an additional 2% tax.
The industry could also create jobs, a detail supporters say is especially enticing at a time when the pandemic has led to unparalleled levels of unemployment in New Jersey.
But first, it’s up to voters to decide.
The pandemic changed the strategy of organizations on both sides of the issue, and fundraising has been a struggle for proponents and opponents. With attention focused on the presidential contest, both sides said they feared voters would skip — or fail to see — the question, which in many counties is printed on the back of ballots.
NJ Can 2020 said it was starting a blitz of advertising on social media platforms.
“We just want to make sure that people are getting down to the ballot question,” said Scott Rudder, a former Republican assemblyman who is now president of New Jersey CannaBusiness Association.
Gregg Edwards, executive director of Don’t Let NJ Go to Pot, which is working to persuade voters to reject the constitutional amendment, said a key part of his organization’s planned campaign — face-to-face presentations to parent organizations, police unions and corporations — was curtailed by the virus.
“I expected to have my calender full talking to PTAs, and those have just gone away,” said Edwards, who worked as a policy adviser to Chris Christie, the former Republican governor.
Edwards said he believed one of the strongest arguments against the referendum was the lasting nature of a vote to change the state constitution. By enshrining legalization in the constitution, towns that are not keen on welcoming marijuana distributors may have a difficult time keeping them out, he said.
The New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police and the New Jersey Psychiatric Association both oppose legalization, and lawmakers in Ocean County have adopted a nonbinding resolution against permitting recreational use of the drug.
Joe Vicari, chairman of the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders, said he was mainly concerned about the risks of drivers operating vehicles while under the influence of marijuana, a worry echoed by the police chiefs.
“I believe it’s a public safety issue,” said Vicari, 73, a former teacher and superintendent. “It has an impairment on your perception, your motor skills, your reflexes.”
Led by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, supporters of legalization have amassed a large coalition of backers and have portrayed the issue as a way to “advance racial justice.” Nationwide, Black people are 3.64 times more likely than white people to be charged with marijuana possession, even though they use the drug at comparable rates, according to a 2018 ACLU report.
“Even as we’ve had this public conversation about legalization, police are still making record numbers of arrests of people of color for marijuana possession and that should be unconscionable,” said Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU-New Jersey.
If the police have fewer reasons to make stops, supporters of legalization argue, there also will be less potential for violent confrontations.
That argument has gained new urgency in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters’ calls for an overhaul of policing intensified in August after another Black man, Jacob Blake, was repeatedly shot in the back by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin. And a grand jury’s decision last month not to charge white police officers for the death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who was shot in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, has continued to fuel protesters’ outrage.
R. Todd Edwards, the political action chairman of the New Jersey conference of the NAACP, said he agreed that legalizing marijuana was a crucial component of reform.
But he said it was also essential for Black communities most harmed by marijuana enforcement to share in the financial benefits of legalization if the ballot initiative passes.
This will be especially important, he said, during conversations about how licenses are issued, and to whom.
“We want a seat at the table all the way through,” Edwards said. “If this passes and we are not at the table, it will have been a big hoax.”

How Kelly Loeffler Went From Atlanta Elite to Trump Loyalist

Full text: Enlarge this image.
DALTON, Ga. — Kelly Loeffler is not just a U.S. senator and a successful businesswoman. She is also one of the social doyennes of Buckhead, the Atlanta neighborhood of the wealthy and aspiring rich, where she has often thrown open the gates of her $10.5 million European-style manse, known as Descante, for charity fundraisers.
The role requires maintaining a certain unruffled poise. So it was impossible to know what Loeffler was thinking as she rolled up to a brewpub in Dalton, Georgia, in late August for a campaign event and was greeted by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fellow Republican who had just won a House primary after promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory and making offensive remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims.
Loeffler and Greene exchanged pleasant chitchat near the front door. Later, Loeffler, who was appointed to her seat last year and must win an upcoming special election to keep it, grabbed a microphone and talked about finishing the wall on the Mexican border, the “fake news” that would never intimidate her and the “dangerous Marxist movement called the Black Lives Matter political organization.”
A reporter asked Loeffler whether she supported Greene, and whether she denounced QAnon.
“Marjorie is fighting to defeat socialism; that’s what I’m focused on,” Loeffler said, adding, “I just thank her for coming out.”
It is a long way from hosting soirees at Descante to joining forces with a right-wing conspiracy theorist at a beer hall. But it is a journey that Loeffler has undertaken in earnest as she seeks to conform to the tastes of Donald Trump’s Republican Party — just one of the many establishment Republicans who have embraced Trumpism in recent years.
For Loeffler, a political newcomer, the journey has meant breaking with old allies, picking new fights and struggling to explain away a life before politics when she occasionally gave money to Democrats, like former Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, and rubbed elbows with Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who ran for Georgia governor in 2018. And her harsh criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement has run afoul of a long-standing convention in her adopted hometown, sometimes referred to as the Atlanta Way, in which the white corporate class has cultivated a level of solidarity with the city’s African American leaders and civil rights movement.
In and around Buckhead, a version of the same question has been discreetly raised among some members of the senator’s social circle: What happened to Kelly Loeffler?
In December, Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, named Loeffler, 49, to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who had resigned for health reasons. Her appointment was widely interpreted as an effort to make the Georgia Republican Party more palatable to middle-class moderates, especially educated women in the Atlanta suburbs who have been abandoning the party in the Trump era.
The appointment is short; Loeffler has to defend her seat in a special election Nov. 3. As the incumbent carrying the governor’s blessing, however, she seemed to have an edge on opponents.
But Trump had made it known that he wanted Kemp to appoint Rep. Doug Collins, a hard-charging conservative who defended Trump at his impeachment. Soon Collins, too, jumped in the race.
The special election will not be preceded by primaries. Rather, it will be a free-for-all pitting the Republican candidates against a number of Democrats, including the Rev. Raphael Warnock, who pastors the Atlanta church once led by Martin Luther King Jr., and Matt Lieberman, the son of former Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.
If no candidate earns a majority of the votes, the top two vote-getters will face off in a January runoff, which has set up a primary-like atmosphere for Loeffler and Collins, with each trying to out-conservative the other, and Loeffler cultivating a new image as a right-wing firebrand.
The change in Loeffler’s public persona has been striking. She is married to Jeffrey C. Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. As a spokesperson for Intercontinental Exchange, the commodities and financial exchange company Sprecher founded in 2000, her name appeared regularly on business-wire news releases. In 2011, when she became a co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, the city’s WNBA franchise, she was praised, in local news stories, for supporting women’s athletics.
The couple’s names appeared on lists of charity donors, their photos on websites from fundraising galas. In 2011, they planned an event for Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, who has since become a villain among Trump supporters for voting to convict the president during his Senate impeachment trial. (Loeffler was also named, in 2012, to Romney’s Georgia finance team.)
That was then. On Sept. 19, Loeffler posted on Twitter that she had just been in Ringgold, Georgia, with Greene at a rally with “Patriotic Georgians.” One photo she posted showed the two women in the presence of camouflage-wearing members of the Georgia III% Martyrs, a far-right militia group, one of whom was carrying a military-style rifle.
But Collins, 54, may prove difficult to out-conservative. The son of a state trooper who hails from the northeast Georgia city of Gainesville, he has an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association and a master’s in divinity from a Baptist seminary. In recent months, he became a hero among Trump supporters, including Fox News host Sean Hannity, for his spirited defense of the president during his impeachment proceedings.
Consider the way the two candidates responded to the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. While Loeffler said on Fox that the Senate should vote on Trump’s choice to fill the seat “regardless of it being an election year,” she also offered her “prayers” for Ginsburg’s family during a difficult time.
Collins, in contrast, marked the passing of Ginsburg in a tweet that said, “RIP to the more than 30 million innocent babies that have been murdered during the decades that Ruth Bader Ginsburg defended pro-abortion laws.”
Online, Collins’ campaign has taken aim at Loeffler’s big Buckhead mansion, and lampoons her use of a private jet with the Twitter handle @AirLoefflair, in keeping with a Georgia populist tradition that frustrated the political ambitions of Buckhead grandee Guy Millner (who ran for statewide office three times and lost), and catapulted Jimmy Carter to the governorship in 1970 after his campaign referred to his wealthy opponent, Carl Sanders, as “cuff links Carl.”
Collins’ first broadcast television ad accuses Loeffler of making “slick ads telling lies,” and touts his record of defending the president. The Collins team has also called Loeffler an “insider trading profiteer” for a stock-trading episode in which the couple reported millions in transactions just after senators received a private briefing on the impacts of COVID-19. The Justice Department informed Loeffler in May that it would not pursue insider trading charges, and Loeffler has denied doing anything wrong.
Then there is the problem of what the Collins campaign calls the “liberal basketball team,” the Atlanta Dream. The Collins team says the basketball team has worked with Planned Parenthood, partnered with a gun control group and hosted a courtside event for Abrams.
At the same time, Loeffler is facing a revolt from the Dream’s players. The team name is an overt nod to Martin Luther King Jr.’s most famous civil rights speech, and most of its players are Black. When the WNBA dedicated its season to Black Lives Matter, Loeffler wrote a letter to the league’s commissioner saying she was opposed because the movement “advocated for the defunding of police” and accused BLM of promoting “violence and destruction.”
In response, WNBA players, led by members of the Dream, began wearing T-shirts declaring “Vote Warnock,” a reference to the Democratic preacher running against Loeffler.
Loeffler has the benefit of self-funding, to the tune of at least $15 million. Her ads have drawn attention to her constituent services and attacked Collins for a “politically correct” 2010 vote for a bill that would have outlawed carrying a gun into private schools.
She has also used her ads to underscore her right-wing credentials. One recent spot riffs humorously on the conceit that Loeffler is “more conservative than Attila the Hun.” In it, an actor playing Attila, speaking in a grunting, made-up language, dictates a to-do list to an underling. The list includes “attack big government” and “eliminate the liberal scribes.”
Loeffler’s run-to-the-right strategy appears to be working so far, at least among Republicans: A poll released Sept. 29 by Quinnipiac University showed her leading Collins by a point, 23% to 22%, though Warnock led the field with 31%, evidence that Democratic voters are consolidating behind him.
A previous poll, conducted in mid-September by The New York Times and Siena College, showed Loeffler ahead of the pack of candidates, with 23% support. The poll showed Collins with 19% support, tied with Warnock, while 27% of respondents said they were undecided.
At the campaign stop at the Dalton brewpub, about 80 miles north of Atlanta, Loeffler, decked out in dark jeans and western boots, demonstrated how she harmonizes the disparate elements of her persona — as a “proud supporter of President Trump” married to a man who collects Basquiats, and as a hard-right populist and self-proclaimed “outsider” who is also one of the wealthiest people ever to serve in Congress.
She spoke of the work ethic she learned on her family’s Illinois farm, and how such values had allowed her rise from obscurity. And she spoke about the nefarious forces that would close the door on such dreams.
“This election is about a choice,” she said. “This is about the things that make America the greatest, most exceptional country in the world, or a divided America, one that destroys opportunity, hope — the American ideal that we all strive for.”

NEW YORK — New York City police officials instructed all officers to wear masks in public or risk discipline, as the department faces mounting criticism over officers’ failure to comply with a state mandate that people wear face coverings in public when social distancing is not possible.
The Police Department’s directive, issued Friday in memos and a video, came after elected officials repeatedly called out the police for flouting the mask mandate they are supposed to enforce. About 400 officers have been assigned to nine neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens where there has been an uptick in coronavirus cases and where the city plans to close nonessential businesses and schools this week.
Terence Monahan, the chief of department and the highest-ranking uniformed officer, appeared in a video sent to officers Friday instructing them to wear masks in public areas, department facilities and where they cannot be socially distanced.
“It is our responsibility to set the example for our great city and do everything we can to help ensure that we do not have another hospitalized member bring this deadly infection into our homes or have another funeral,” he said.
A memo sent later in the day added that the requirement applies to shared offices, elevators, halls and bathrooms, and at all times in the first 14 days of an officer’s return from places with a travel advisory. But officials carved out exceptions when officers are eating and drinking, adjusting their masks or having difficulty breathing.
A second memo, first reported by the New York Post, warned that officers who did not follow the rules could face disciplinary action. The memo did not specify how officers might be punished, but the department has options ranging in severity from verbal or written warnings up to suspension or termination.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the police last week for ignoring the mask mandate. And Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been dismissive for months toward complaints about officers not wearing masks, said last week that there should be penalties for those who do not comply.
Police officers’ failure to wear masks has been a point of tension since the spring, when they were initially made responsible for enforcing social-distancing measures. During mass protests that erupted in the city after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, thousands of officers assigned to the demonstrations did not wear masks.
The Civilian Complaint Review Board, which investigates complaints from the public about officer misconduct, said Sunday that it had referred 156 complaints about officers who failed to wear masks to the Police Department since March. It was unclear if the department disciplined any of the officers involved.
Attention returned to the police last month as coronavirus cases began rising again in the city, and the mayor announced that officers would once again be told to enforce masking and social-distancing requirements.
Cuomo complained on Sunday that local officials were not doing enough to slow the spread of the virus in the hot spots and threatened to close all business activity in those areas if local governments did not step up. Last week, he threatened fines of up to $10,000 a day for lax enforcement.
The directives from the Police Department were issued hours after President Donald Trump revealed that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. But Monahan, in the video, said the reminder was timed ahead of a memorial service scheduled on Monday in Manhattan for 46 police department employees who died from COVID-19.
At the peak of the pandemic, almost 20% of the department’s 36,000 officers were out sick. Many continue to test positive for the virus, Monahan said in the video.
Over the weekend, compliance among officers was mixed. Twitter users shared photos after the directive went out showing officers in Times Square and other locations who were not wearing masks. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, spoke at a Republican rally Saturday on Staten Island where organizers did not require masks and many in the crowd did not wear them.
“We understand the seriousness of it, but the nature of our job makes it difficult to always think first of the mask,” said Lynch in an interview with NY1, a local television station.
A police officer outside the 10th Precinct station house in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood around noon Sunday was wearing a mask as she stood guard at the entrance. But a stream of officers and detectives entering and leaving the station did not wear anything over their faces.
In Washington Square Park in Manhattan, Maya Carmosino, 23, said the majority of officers she had seen during the pandemic had not been wearing masks or were not wearing them properly over their noses and mouths. Although she was hopeful that the directive would change officers’ behavior, she remained skeptical, she said.
“It’ll be great if they’re not hypocritical,” Carmosino said.
Moe Singleton, 31, of the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, said he did not think the police were wearing masks more or less frequently than anyone else. He said he had seen people across the city, officers and not, wearing masks improperly — “as headbands, on their elbows, as chin hammocks” — or not at all.
Still, Singleton, who moved to New York a year ago from Richmond, Virginia, thought that the police should be held to a higher standard when it came to mask compliance, since they were enforcing the law.
“If they don’t do it, why would we?” he said, adding, “It’s just a power thing.”
Jim McShane, 69, who lives in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, sympathized with officers as he rode his bicycle in Manhattan on Sunday. He said he did not think that they should be held to a higher standard.
“They’re human,” McShane said. “I mean, masks can be uncomfortable or hot or you’re thirsty or something.”

NEW YORK — I was one of the lucky ones. I already had a bicycle when the coronavirus paralyzed New York City and my world shrunk to the size of a one-bedroom apartment in Harlem. As I dusted off my 3-year-old bike, I heard countless stories from friends trying, and failing, to find bikes of their own. One went to Philadelphia to buy one that fit him. Another cobbled together a Frankenbike from three rusty carcasses in her parents’ garage.
The mad rush for pedal power happened all over the world, but it was manic in New York. Most of us don’t have cars, and we were desperate for some way, any way, to get from one place to another safely.
When restrictions around lockdown loosened in early summer, I made my initial, tentative forays: loops of Central Park, night rides down the Hudson River Greenway to Battery Park and back. Compared with Amsterdam; Copenhagen, Denmark; or even Beijing, New York is not a bike-friendly city. Protected bike lanes disappear in the middle of intersections or switch sides of the road abruptly. Elsewhere, those “bike lanes” double as loading bays for FedEx trucks and rest stops for NYPD vans.
As I became more comfortable in the city, I also became more ambitious. I put aside entire afternoons to explore the boroughs. Then, entire days, leaving after breakfast, returning in time for the 7 p.m. cheer to health care workers. Over the course of repeated rides to the beach at Fort Tilden in Queens, I got to know the gyro seller at the western terminus of Brooklyn’s Shore Parkway, who would have an ice-cold Gatorade ready for me before I asked for it. Nearby at Floyd Bennett Field, the decommissioned airfield, I watched cars slowly and nervously do laps up and down the derelict runway: parents teaching their teenagers to drive, I realized.
I rolled past three-story houses with manicured yards in Canarsie, where it was quiet as the suburbs. Then, minutes later I was in Brownsville, where life played out loudly on the sidewalks. I rode past socially distanced birthday parties on street corners in the Bronx and Friday night bachata ragers in Washington Heights.
And, still, I craved more. Where could I go from New York City, with panniers packed and nothing to do for multiple days but pedal? My urge to go — it didn’t matter where — was to be expected.
I had an unconventional 2019. As the 52 Places Traveler for The New York Times, I was in a different part of the world every week for an entire year. It was a constant avalanche of the new and the unexpected. Every day was different. I made friends on six continents, shared meals with strangers, got lost at least once a week, filled a passport and a half. I knew 2020 was going to be different — but the abrupt transition from perpetual movement to total stasis was beyond anything I could have imagined.
My bicycle — a decent gravel bike, which can handle both city streets and country paths — became not only an antidote to claustrophobia but also a way to tap into what I missed emotionally. What I didn’t know, as I took my first rides and felt unused muscles creak back into gear, was how it would make me fall in love with New York, in a way that had eluded me for half a decade.
Venturing Out
As my urge to travel grew, I started looking farther afield. Suddenly, strangely, New Jersey beckoned, and the George Washington Bridge was my gateway. Like many hardy city cyclists, I started with Route 9W, the stretch of roadway that runs above the Hudson’s western banks. Roadies, clad in Lycra and riding shiny carbon fiber bikes, flock there en masse, attracted by generous road shoulders and rolling hills.
There was no chance I’d keep up with the pelotons that went shooting by me every few miles. But as I quickly realized, there was nothing to be intimidated about either. At the Filling Station, an open-air burger joint on 9W popular with weekending families and cyclists, I learned maintenance tips from riders with legs so muscled they looked like bundles of firewood.
In those moments it hit me with such force: I miss strangers. Profound conversations in dimly lit dive bars and impromptu invitations to dinner at a stranger’s house can be the most rewarding souvenirs of a trip — they certainly were for me last year. But my relative isolation this year has made what few interactions I have had, no matter how fleeting, stick with me.
There was the young boy, somewhere near Demarest, New Jersey, who I saw crossing a road on his BMX bike unaware of a car speeding toward him. “Watch out!” I yelled. He stopped in his tracks. The coast clear, he passed me, and I noticed he was wearing a face mask decorated with math equations. His glasses were fogged up by his breath. “Phewy! That was a close one,” he squeaked. “Thanks, sir!”
On Henry Hudson Drive, the hilly, mostly car-free road that runs under 9W, closer to the water, I met an amateur ornithologist who pointed out a family of bald eagles nesting in a tall tree. I checked on the birds regularly over the course of multiple spring rides. They were there until Hurricane Isaias hit the East Coast this summer.
On one of my regular loops up 9W, across the shiny new bike lane on the Tappan Zee (or, if we’re being official about it, the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge) and back down through Westchester County, I saw a couple on a bike ride. They both wore masks and, as I approached and overheard their stilted, overly polite conversation, I felt a wave of nervous energy: a first date, surely. I waved and rode on.
A Real Vacation
Eventually, I started dreaming bigger. I somehow persuaded my partner, Maggie, that after nine months exclusively in each other’s company, a multiday bike trip was just what we needed.
I picked a destination — the house of some friends in the Catskills’ southern reaches I had long been promising to visit — and started planning our route. It would be 220 miles round trip, split into four days of riding, with two days in our friends’ converted RV behind their house. I had no idea whether this is something that people did on bicycles. It surely wasn’t something I would have considered before 2020.
As the trip approached, I pored over online maps, recreating our route through Google Street View. I obsessed over the weather forecast. I washed the bicycles. When the day arrived, we packed everything up, strapped the bags to our bikes, and we were off. I had no illusions that this would be a carefree jaunt through Europe, where transcontinental bike trails stretch from the Atlantic to the Black Sea. It would not even be like some of the more popular touring routes out West, where extensive infrastructure is built around cycling. But it was not nearly as harrowing as I secretly feared it might be.
We rode 9W until Nyack, New York, where we turned off onto a gravel track that wrapped the edge of Hook Mountain State Park, taking us along the riverbank and up steep inclines into thick forests. I was concerned that stretches like this might prove difficult for Maggie, who rides a skinny-tired road bike.
Though I had been training all summer, Maggie had never cycled more than 50 miles in one stretch — but she did so every day for four days without ever running out of steam. It is a testament to what good shape she is in (and how out of shape I was after a year spent in hotels and rental cars). She flew by me on tricky, gravelly descents. When she got stung in the leg by a wasp, she tucked an ice pack under the edge of her bike shorts and kept riding.
Past the park, we continued through the town of Haverstraw, in Rockland County, where we wished we could have stopped for lunch, shocked by the sheer concentration of Mexican restaurants and bakeries. But intent on avoiding riding after dark, we continued on. Eventually, after crossing to the eastern side of the Hudson via the Bear Mountain Bridge, we finished the day in Cold Spring, where we rewarded our day’s efforts with beer and pizza. We had covered 51 miles. The next day, after a luxurious in-room breakfast (perfect for social distancing) at the quaint Pig Hill Inn, we were back on the road.
Our ride through the Hudson Valley and into the Catskills was dominated by blissfully car-free rail trails — asphalt, gravel and dirt pathways where train tracks used to be. The Dutchess Rail Trail took us through sun-dappled woodland to Poughkeepsie. There, we wove around the occasional jogger and day-tripping family as we crossed the aptly named Walkway Over the Hudson, stopping to take in the expansive panorama. New York City’s skyline was nowhere in sight.
Then, it was even more car-free abandon: The Hudson Valley Rail Trail carried us to New Paltz, where we caught the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail, a rougher dirt path where we had to carry our bikes over the fallen branches from a recent storm. Soon, we came upon Coppersea Distilling and without thinking twice rode down the driveway, breathing in the scent of whiskey. Under the hot midday sun, it took every piece of willpower I had not to buy one of the advertised bourbon slushies. But we did leave with our panniers one bourbon bottle heavier. Sunlight streamed through the trees and danced across the gravel like liquid gold. The hum of crickets never stopped.
Every new stretch felt like its own destination — and that continued as we neared the Catskills. Off the trails, we hit mostly empty mountain roads, where our pace slowed as we crawled up steep, winding inclines. There were many, and we groaned at each new climb. Then, realizing there was no one around to judge us, we yelled instead, our cries punctuated by laughter. Once at our friend’s house, on top of a mountain near the town of Olivebridge, we encountered more of the elements of travel I missed so dearly.
There was meandering conversation, outdoors and relatively virus-safe. There was spontaneity: a morning trip to an ice-cold swimming hole. There were magical moments, too, the kind that you can hardly believe yourself when you recount them later. In this case, it was a night shooting off fireworks with our friends’ neighbor, a Grammy-nominated musician I’ve been listening to since I was a teenager. I kept it together.
Making our way back toward the city, we took a different route to keep it interesting. It pays to check elevation gains, I learned, when our route took us up and over the Mohonk Preserve. Every climbing turn revealed another one on the horizon. For the views of the valley — red barns glowing in green fields — and for the winding descent, it was worth it. We passed through New Paltz and laughed at how shocked we were by the Labor Day crowds. Just a few days in the country were enough to make these residents of New York City anxious at the sight of packed sidewalks. We spent the night at an Airbnb in Beacon, one we chose for its proximity to town and, it being a studio-style cottage behind someone’s house, the ability to check in and out without interacting with anyone.
For the final stretch, we found ourselves on car-free rail trails again — this time the North and South County Trailways. The two connecting trails make up a 35-mile tree-lined, paved path stretching from the Bronx up to Baldwin Place, where the Putnam Trailway takes over. As we passed colorful birdhouses nailed onto the branches of towering trees, the rusty remains of the railway running alongside asphalt, I realized that it was the ride itself that I would remember most. Over and over again, I had uninterrupted minutes to relish every scene with every sense: scenes that, on a road trip, I would zoom right past, blasting music and the air conditioner.
But there was something else. While the Catskills had, in my imagination, always been a place I could go to — an escape so separate from the city I call home — now I knew what the in-between felt like, and I loved it as much as I did the destination. Having had my world contract so suddenly in the first months of 2020, I felt it expanding again — slowly, gradually, mindfully, at the speed of my bicycle.
Tips for cycling around and out of New York City
— A host of great apps can help you plan rides. Besides showing elevation maps, they often include routes that are safest for bicycles, sticking to trails and less-trafficked roads. None are perfect, though, so I found that your best bet is to cross-reference between three of the best: Google Maps (choose the bicycle option), Ride With GPS and Komoot.
— In pre-COVID times, a number of local bike shops and cycling clubs offered organized bike-packing and bicycle touring trips out of the city. While those tours have largely been suspended, they can still be great resources to get local tips and gear recommendations. Depending on what you’re after, 718 Cyclery, a bike shop in the South Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn; the NYC Adventure Cycling Club on Meetup.com; and the New York Cycle Club are good places to start if you’re interested in learning more from seasoned bike tourers.
— While most experts agree that outdoor, solo exercise is generally safe, it is important to take every precaution. Bike paths in New York City’s parks and along the Hudson Greenway can get very busy during peak hours, so it’s best to have a mask at the ready. The same goes for some of the rail trails in the Hudson Valley, where it is sometimes hard to pass other cyclists or runners at a distance.

PORTSMOUTH, Ohio — It was right around 10 p.m. at Buffalo Wild Wings on Scioto Trail when the needle swung from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump.
I was standing near the bar with two of my colleagues from Reuters News watching the election returns on Nov. 8, 2016, after a long week of reporting. Our assignment had been to choose a spot in Trump Country and get to know the voters in order to write something meaningful about their inevitable loss.
The numbers on the television screens above the bar told a different story, signaling to the country that Trump, despite having trailed consistently in national polls, would be the next president. The few slouching customers who remained barely acknowledged a result that would prove to be a pivotal juncture in America. We exited into a cold rain.
Portsmouth, Ohio, was a struggling city then, with a blighted downtown and an enormous opioid addiction problem. Unemployment hovered near 13%, and a third of local residents were living in poverty. The local fire chief had described it as “hell.”
Trump had come close enough to Portsmouth while campaigning to hear about some of its problems. A local businessman, Jeff Albrecht, had traveled to Columbus to meet the candidate and had lobbied for the reopening of a shuttered uranium enrichment plant that had once employed hundreds of locals, an idea Trump promised to explore. With a Trump victory, things might finally improve for the first time since the Empire-Detroit Steel mill and the Selby Shoe Co. factory closed decades ago.
I returned to Portsmouth last month to find a surprise: Even in this coronavirus year, things are getting better, but not because of anything the Trump administration has done.
A group of local citizens determined to meet the community’s challenges is driving the change — sprucing up the downtown area, organizing community events and opening new stores and restaurants. The local university, Shawnee State, is expanding its student population again and had its highest-ever increase in freshman enrollment last year. While opioid deaths remain high, new programs to help recovering addicts are adding to a sense around town that all is not hopeless.
While the 2016 election seemed to hold particular significance for Portsmouth because of Trump’s pledge to rejuvenate the region’s economy, things are different now. Trump is expected to prevail easily in Scioto County over his rival, Joe Biden. But his supporters no longer describe a strong connection between his candidacy and their hopes for Portsmouth.
“They are attracted to him because of his attitude, the way he pokes a finger in the eye of the establishment,” said John McHenry, a Democratic candidate for Scioto County commissioner who is expecting Trump to win at least half the county’s vote again this year.
But it wasn’t just Trump’s attitude that impressed his loyalists; they said they had seen results in areas like trade and foreign policy that, though not directly beneficial to Portsmouth, were good for the country. “The man is doing the majority of what he said he was going to do, good, bad or indifferent,” said Portsmouth’s city manager, Sam Sutherland, who voted for Trump in 2016.
‘It’s Just a Real Easy Choice for Me’
Portsmouth, a town of 20,000 people, lies on the Appalachian region’s northern edge. It is bordered by the Ohio and Scioto rivers on two sides and on the other two by steep hills and lush forests. In an earlier era, this landscape was crucial to the country’s economic engine: Its mountains were mined for coal and copper; its riverways were vital transportation arteries. But the mines, mills and factories that employed its residents are gone now, as are the stores and other small businesses that their presence supported.
The past four years have included some fresh disappointments.
Just after Trump took office, a small company unveiled plans for a new $1.3 billion aluminum mill on the Ohio River near Portsmouth, promising 550 permanent jobs paying an average of $70,000 by 2020. Money for the project never materialized. The uranium enrichment plant is still closed, too.
Trump’s tax cuts have helped, some say, but other initiatives have not. Two opportunity zones, which offer investors tax breaks for buying into building projects, now blanket most of the town. But the program has only spawned one deal, a hotel, and its construction has stalled. Window frames jut at precarious angles from its shell.
Still, Trump remains in good standing with many voters here because what he has preached is aligned with what they believe.
They have also considered the president’s message that Biden was failing mentally.
“My father had Alzheimer’s before he died,” Albrecht, 70, told me. “He had a very distant look in his eyes, a faraway look, and when I look at Biden, sometimes I see that look.”
Albrecht invited a small group of locals to meet with me to discuss the election. Nine of us sat in a wide circle in a ballroom at the local Holiday Inn, which Albrecht owns. Everyone wore a mask.
Brian Noble, a retired insurance agency owner, was one of the five people in the group who said they were voting for Trump. “I like the moral stances that he takes on things, creating jobs, all things economywise,” Noble said. As for Biden: “I just don’t see him as a leader,” he said. “It’s just a real easy choice for me.”
Trump had not yet been diagnosed with COVID-19, but talk turned to his handling of the virus. Most people in the room said they believed that the president had done the best job he could.
“He enacted the travel ban very quickly,” Noble said. “I don’t know what else he could have done.”
After Trump’s diagnosis became public on Friday, Noble reaffirmed his view in a telephone interview and added: “I think he’ll be fine.”
Trump’s supporters said they saw his erratic behavior as a sign of his brilliance. One woman brought up astrology: Because she was a Gemini, she said, she understood Trump — also a Gemini — and knew that the incendiary things he said were part of a strategy to manipulate people and achieve success.
I also saw how Trump’s appeals to a white, conservative social order resonated in Portsmouth. Kim Hill, a local Realtor, voted for Trump in 2016 and said she believed that he had improved the country’s economy.
There were more long-haul transport trucks on the road during her weekly drives to Dayton and more cargo pods stacked onto the rail cars that trundle daily past Portsmouth, she said, adding, “I never noticed that when Obama was in office.”
Hill raised another topic. Saying that she admired Trump’s hard-line stance on immigration, she recounted that while she lived in France in the 1990s, she had lamented the country’s decision to let large numbers of Africans emigrate there. “In just a 10-year period of time, it drastically changed to where you didn’t even feel like you were in France. You felt like you were in South Africa,” she said.
Still, she said she felt a kinship with Black Lives Matter protesters, because she saw a bit of her younger self in them — the girl who walked around barefoot and loved the Rolling Stones.
I checked back in with Hill by phone to see how she viewed Trump’s debate performance last week and what she thought of his COVID diagnosis. The debate had been painful to watch, she said, and had made her question her allegiance to him. She said that she wished he had taken the coronavirus more seriously.
Trump’s debate outing did not shake Albrecht.
“What people like about him is the tax cut,” he said. “They feel safer now. They feel like if they go visit New York City that they’re not going to get attacked by some terrorist group. They like his stance on China and trade. They like that he wants to make government smaller.”
For Democrats, Biden Is ‘One of Us’
Like the rest of the country, Portsmouth has experienced political discord. There have been conflicts over mask-wearing, yard signs and banners. Democrats are outnumbered here, and some are wary that expressing their views could hurt their businesses or end friendships.
Others are more upfront. One afternoon, I got lost while driving on a steep hill above town and ended up face to face with a woman in a golf cart. When she found out I was a journalist writing about the election, she unleashed a torrent of vitriol about Trump. She said she did not understand how women could support him, given the way he had bragged about groping them and the fact that he wanted to take away their right to have an abortion.
The woman, Teeny Musser-Pettay, who is in her late 60s, invited her sister and a group of friends to a nearby park to meet me and talk about the election. They were bound by a common disgust with Trump. What’s more, they seemed enthusiastic about Biden.
“He grew up as one of us,” said Doug Hines, the owner of a local awning and canopy business who had come to the gathering with his wife, daughter and adult grandson. “His appeal is more towards your everyday normal person that goes to work and comes home to his family.”
Another member of the group, Carol Cyrus, asked those gathered whether there was anything Biden could do that would undermine their support for him. Everyone agreed there was not.
This was a change from the last time. On Election Day in 2016, I asked a Democratic candidate for local office, Trampas Puckett, whom he had just voted for.
“I voted for the Democrat,” he said.
“And who is that?”
“The Democrat,” he said again. He could not bring himself to say Clinton’s name.
Some Black residents in Portsmouth expressed an even greater urgency this time around.
The Rev. Margaret V.L. Tyson, the pastor at Portsmouth’s AME church, told her 25 congregants on a recent Sunday about a visit she had made to a white evangelical church nearby, where she was a guest speaker. She and the church’s pastor got along well, she said, but she was alarmed by his congregation.
“I got into a discussion last week with some Christians who didn’t look like us, who tried to tell me that there was no white privilege,” Tyson told her congregation. “I just said, ‘I’m going to pray for you all, and I’m going to stay away from you all.’”
Childhood Friends Go in Different Directions
Will Platzer was a senior at Portsmouth West High School when Trump won in 2016. Some of his classmates were already relying on Facebook for news and soaking up the conspiracy theories that circulated about Clinton.
I visited Platzer’s government class at the time and met a student who said she had asked her parents about the “Access Hollywood” audiotape of Trump boasting about groping women; they told her it was fake, she said, circulated by the Clinton campaign.
The virtual world Platzer and his peers occupy is even darker now, and also more real. In June, Platzer’s best friend from childhood, Eli Eaton, formed a Facebook group called American Freedom Fighters and prepared to lead an armed group to Louisville, Kentucky, to confront, as he put it, “the enemy,” during protests over the killing by police of Breonna Taylor.
“We’re under a terrorist attack,” Eaton said in a video posted to the group’s page, adding that Louisville police had offered “100% support” for his plan.
“I was terrified,” said Platzer, a senior at the University of Cincinnati. He began taking screenshots of Eaton’s Facebook page and sending them to Black Lives Matter protest organizers in Louisville to warn them.
Louisville police publicly rejected Eaton. His group abandoned its plan to go to downtown Louisville during a planned protest but drove to the edge of town, where the group members waited in their trucks for news of violence. None occurred.
Eaton said that he had been misunderstood. In an interview at a Portsmouth restaurant, he said he was not a white supremacist and that he respected protesters’ rights to demonstrate peacefully. He had merely wanted to help protect businesses in Louisville, he said.
But Eaton’s view of the world is defined by a web of conspiracy theories.
He said believes that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were somehow faked and that the police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck is not the same man who was charged with Floyd’s murder (“Look at the ear structure in particular,” he advised).
Eaton used to accompany Platzer’s family on vacations to Florida. The two no longer talk. Their divergence hints at the fundamentally different realities and potentially irreconcilable ruptures that have emerged in Portsmouth.
There are signs, though, that an alternative lies within their grasp as well.
‘What’s Really Important Is Coming Together’
Three years ago, a group of lawyers, real estate agents and other local professionals in their late 30s and early 40s decided they could wait no longer. Without help from outside investors, they began buying up crumbling buildings downtown, some of them 150 years old, renovating them and opening stores and businesses. They created a winter festival and logged local residents into the “Guinness World Records” book for wholesome group activities like singing and potting plants. Portsmouth was named a Hometown Christmas Town by the Hallmark Channel last year and an All-America City in August.
Partisan politics are put aside. “If I affiliate myself with one political party, I’m not going to be able to maintain this unity that we have in the community right now,” said the group’s leader, Jeremy Burnside.
That does not mean avoiding important issues. When a group of Black residents convened in June to talk about ways to promote racial equality — around 6% of Portsmouth’s residents are Black — Burnside was eager to participate. The group organized an Emancipation Day celebration, held on Sept. 22.
“I feel like this is the civil rights movement era again,” said Tia King, who helped organize the event. “If I can do something to make things better for my kids, I’m all about it.”
King recalled crying for two days after the 2016 election and said she was trying to persuade her husband, who voted for Trump, to choose Biden this time.
The event drew a larger crowd than King had expected.
At the local bandshell, 200 people gathered to listen to a historian from Shawnee State talk about a Portsmouth barber’s role in helping fugitive slaves reach safety as part of the Underground Railroad. They heard a speech by Al Oliver, a Portsmouth native who won the World Series with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1971, and listened to a performance by a local gospel choir.
After the speeches, attendees, including groups of school-age children, boarded buses for a tour of Portsmouth, during which local actors in costume depicted scenes from the town’s history.
The gathering appeared to straddle the partisan divide. Sitting near the front of the band shell audience was Richard Baldwin, 63, who said he was a Pentecostal Christian and that he adamantly opposed abortion.
“I’m a Republican,” he said, adding that he had voted for Trump in 2016 and would do so again this year.
I asked him whether he was concerned about Trump’s views on racial equality or his rejection of anti-discrimination policies.
“What’s really important is coming together, things like this,” Baldwin said, gesturing toward the stage. “We shouldn’t be talking about politics.”

WASHINGTON — Department of Homeland Security officers considered extracting data from cellphones seized from protesters in Portland, Oregon, which would have been a remarkable violation of privacy and the right to peaceable assembly, House Democrats said Friday.
Lawmakers on the Intelligence Committee called a hearing Friday to examine the allegations of Brian Murphy, the former chief of the department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, who has accused department leaders of suppressing intelligence warnings of violent white supremacy and Russian election interference.
But Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chair of the committee, opened the hearing by revealing that it had found that homeland security intelligence analysts were sent to Portland and questioned demonstrators. The Federal Protective Service, the homeland security agency that protects federal property, requested that the analysts “extract data” from phones seized from the protesters without a search warrant, a request that went unfulfilled, Schiff said.
Joseph Maher, the acting chief of intelligence office, indicated that he had heard of the gathering effort, although he could not recall who in the agency had told him.
He said the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general was investigating.
Maher testified for the first time since his predecessor, Murphy, filed a whistleblower complaint claiming department leadership blocked the release of intelligence warnings of violent racist extremists and Russia’s efforts to denigrate Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for president. Despite President Donald Trump’s attempts to play down Russian influence, Maher joined a chorus of administration officials, including the FBI director, Christopher Wray, in confirming the threat.
“Is Russia actively trying to denigrate Joe Biden?” Schiff asked.
“Yes,” said Maher, who assumed oversight of the intelligence office in August.
The intelligence branch of the Department of Homeland Security has come under fire over its efforts to gather information on protesters in Portland and the journalists covering the unrest. Murphy’s allegations that senior leadership of the department tried to distort assessments of threats facing the country has fueled criticism that an agency built to coordinate the federal government’s response to national emergencies has instead bent perceptions of those threats to the political whims of the president.
The intelligence committee has investigated the Department of Homeland Security since it dispatched tactical teams over the summer to face protesters outside a federal courthouse in downtown Portland.
A central duty of the intelligence office is to gather data from the various federal agencies, as well as publicly available sources, and include it in unclassified intelligence bulletins used to inform state and local law enforcement agencies of emerging national security threats.
The Department of Homeland Security did not approve the request to glean data from protesters’ cellphones, but Democrats expressed concern.
“This is a situation where an element of the United States intelligence community, not law enforcement personnel, is being asked to use tools meant to counter terrorism or national security threats, not Americans who are exercising their constitutional rights,” said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.
Maher took over the intelligence office after Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the department, demoted Murphy, whose analysts included the Twitter posts of journalists covering Portland, including those of a New York Times reporter, in intelligence bulletins that were distributed to law enforcement officers across the United States.
Murphy has said the demotion was retaliation for filing complaints with the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security.
Maher said including information on the journalists was “not an appropriate production of an intelligence report.” Maher also revealed the agency began a review of intelligence disseminated since May and found “there were a number of other reports that were issued that shouldn’t have been issued.”
“I don’t think they were about journalists,” Maher said, adding only that they were “not appropriate under intelligence tradecraft.”
The other journalist who was included in the intelligence bulletins is the editor-in-chief of Lawfare, Benjamin Wittes, who tweeted an email from Murphy directing officers to begin referring to individuals attacking federal facilities in Portland as “VIOLENT ANTIFA ANARCHISTS.”
Asked whether he was aware of any politicizing of intelligence in the office, Maher pointed to that message from Murphy.
The Department of Homeland Security has also cast Murphy, a former FBI agent, as an unreliable source of whistleblower information. The agency sent a letter last month to the House Intelligence Committee quoting an email of Murphy’s that stated that “the acting secretary has never given me any direction on what to do regarding threats.”
Democrats and Republicans on the committee spent much of the hearing arguing over the time it had taken to clear Murphy’s lawyers to sit in on his closed-door testimony with the committee, which will include classified information. Maher said the department was expediting the process, which has taken weeks.
Mark Zaid, Murphy’s lawyer, said the department was slow-walking the process. He said he had received clearance to listen to previous testimonies and the agency could issue him a waiver.
“Mr. Murphy remains committed to providing relevant classified information to the appropriate oversight entities, including Congress, to support his lawful whistleblower complaint,” Zaid said. “As soon as his legal team can be cleared in order to provide effective representation, we are immediately prepared to ensure proper oversight happens.”
Murphy has also accused the Department of Homeland Security of withholding the release of an assessment of threats facing the country that was finished in March. A September draft of the assessment obtained by the Times showed analysts affirmed that white supremacist extremists “will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland through 2021.” It also singled out Russia as the “primary covert influence actor and purveyor of disinformation and misinformation.”
In September, the department committed to publicly releasing the report on Thursday. Seven months after Murphy said it was completed, it still has not been distributed.
“The homeland threat assessment is forthcoming — there is no statutory deadline for the product,” said Chase Jennings, a spokesperson for the agency.

Tom Who? Cam Newton Is Moving New England Past Brady

Full text: Enlarge this image.
BOSTON — Monday morning, Alex Sarkis entered the athletic apparel store next to Gillette Stadium, home to the New England Patriots, and bypassed two racks of Tom Brady jerseys. Sarkis, 21, a lifelong Patriots fan, had driven 90 minutes from his home in western Massachusetts to Foxborough to buy the hottest-selling sports item in New England: the distinctive No. 1 jersey of the Patriots’ new quarterback, Cam Newton.
“It’s not an easy adjustment for sports fans around here,” Sarkis said of Newton replacing Brady, whose status in the region after six Super Bowl titles may only be surpassed by Paul Revere. “For a lot of us, Brady is all we knew. But that’s obviously changed.”
The turnabout for Patriots fans has been jarring on multiple levels. Brady, now playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was adopted by tradition-bound New England in part for his quiet and reserved deportment. Newton is outspoken and favors flamboyant fashions when not in uniform. Brady had attained a degree of international cultural celebrity. Newton spent the last year in relative obscurity, largely unable to play because of ill-defined injuries that cast doubt on his worth to an NFL franchise. On the field, Brady is a conventional, old-style pocket passer, while Newton’s greatest asset is a versatility that includes creative, elusive dashes upfield.
Most unavoidably, Newton this month became the first Black quarterback to begin a season as New England’s first-string starter.
“Personally, I think it’s great that he’s a Patriot, especially with what’s going on in the country right now,” Sarkis said. “New England has a reputation as not exactly being the most diverse place.”
Because of his dynamic play in the Patriots’ first three games this season — two of them victories — Newton, by nearly every measure, has been welcomed enthusiastically by New England fans. This week, for example, much of the chatter on local sports talk radio was about whether Newton might win the NFL’s MVP Award. His jersey is a top seller in the six New England states since Sept. 1, according to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports merchandise. (Although, interestingly, Brady’s Buccaneers jersey ranks second in New England. Nationally, Brady merchandise ranks No. 1, but sales of Newton jerseys are almost equal.)
Still, Newton’s presence in such a high-profile position in and around Boston, a city with a complicated, checkered racial past, has others in the community warily watching and wondering if he will be treated differently than a white quarterback. What happens if the Patriots’ first Black quarterback to be a regular starter loses consecutive games?
“The minute there are significant enough missteps for Cam Newton, then that opens the floodgates for all of the other criticisms of him, not just as a player, but of his character,” said Rahsaan Hall, a laywer and the director of the racial justice program for the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.
“I’m almost confident that the critique is not going to be, ‘See, that’s the problem with Black quarterbacks.’ Or code words like, ‘That’s the problem with athletic quarterbacks.’ ”
Hall, who was invited by New England coach Bill Belichick to address the Patriots this summer after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May, added: “I think it’s going to be critiques of, ‘If he wasn’t so busy buying these high-end suits or out there commenting on other issues then he’d be able to focus on what’s going on on the field.’ ”
Newton’s acceptance by the Patriots community to date has been aided by several piecemeal, even symbolic, developments. One of the first was the early, eager endorsement he received from Belichick, who rarely praises new Patriots before they have proved themselves for the team.
“Nobody works harder than Cam does — he’s here early, he stays late, and he works very hard,” Belichick said last month. “He’s got a great personality. He gets along with everybody. He’s very social and has a great presence.”
Belichick’s ardent, and quick, support of Newton was a surprise to many since Newton’s flashy personality appeared in conflict with the strait-laced approach of Belichick. But Jermaine Wiggins, a tight end on the Patriots’ first Super Bowl championship team who is now a host on Boston sports talk radio station WEEI, never doubted that Belichick would find common ground with his new quarterback.
“If you look at Bill Belichick’s track record, he coached all kinds of people from Lawrence Taylor to Randy Moss to Corey Dillon to Tom Brady,” Wiggins said. “He’s been exposed to a lot and wouldn’t have lasted this long without being able to adjust and get along with all types of players.”
Another early turning point for Newton may have come after New England’s only loss to date, a game at Seattle that ended when Newton was stopped a yard short of scoring a game-winning touchdown on the final play. Although two botched blocks by Patriots players at the line of scrimmage were the prominent cause of the play’s failure, Newton took the blame afterward and said he should have tried a different path to the end zone.
It may be something many quarterbacks would do, but teammates and fans nonetheless took notice.
“Cam will put the team first,” safety Devin McCourty said.
Mike Connolly, a Patriots fan from Foxborough, Massachusetts, had another perspective.
“It’s been clear to all of us from the beginning that his teammates and coach Belichick really like Cam,” Connolly said. “That goes a long way.”
Even Newton’s style of play might have helped his popularity because his dual-threat presence has spurred an overhaul of the team’s offensive attack.
“I think Cam has surprised and energized the fan base because it’s something different,” said Scott Zolak, a former Patriots quarterback who has become a host on Boston sports talk radio station WBZ-FM. “And that’s probably a good thing post-Tom Brady.”
And then there’s Newton’s penchant for giving his new teammates nicknames. In interviews with reporters this month, it seems that Newton never refers to another Patriot by his first or last name.
Veteran receiver Julian Edelman is “Highway 11,” a nod to Edelman’s uniform number. Offensive tackle Isaiah Wynn is “Winnie the Pooh.” McCourty and his twin brother Jason, who is also a New England defensive back, are “Twin No. 1 and Twin No. 2.” Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is “Mickey Ds.” And, Belichick is “Dolla’ Dolla’ Bill.” Newton concedes he does not use his nickname for his coach often.
How the rest of the Patriots’ season unfolds, and whether Newton will continue to play a predominant role in its success or failure, is yet to be seen. But rest assured, with some parameters, it is already being scrutinized as a potential milestone event in New England.
“Do I look forward to the day when Black kids around Boston have on Newton jerseys? Absolutely I do,” said Saida Grundy, an assistant professor of sociology and African American studies at Boston University. “Do I think that does something for Black pride? Or New England? Yes, I do. Ultimately, that does not change the NFL as an organization, and it doesn’t raise the Black wealth index here a dime. It does not desegregate Boston. But that pride is worth something. Absolutely, it’s worth something.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A dozen grand jurors pored over evidence for 2 1/2 days last week as they examined the killing of Breonna Taylor, an inquiry that would usually remain secret forever.
But an audio recording of more than 20 hours of those proceedings is expected to be made public by noon Friday, an extraordinarily unusual move that could shed light on what evidence the jurors considered. The grand jury ultimately chose to indict one former detective with endangering Taylor’s neighbors and declined to bring charges against either of the Louisville police officers who shot her during a raid on her apartment in March.
The recording will be a rare window into grand jury proceedings, in which jurors can review evidence, call witnesses and determine which charges to pursue, although they do not always exercise those rights.
The expected release of the recording comes after one of the grand jurors filed a court motion this week that asked for the proceedings to be made public and accused Kentucky’s attorney general, Daniel Cameron, of using the jurors “as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility,” even as Cameron has insisted that jurors were given “all of the evidence.”
Cameron said this week that the grand jury was told that the two white officers who shot Taylor, a Black emergency room technician, “were justified in their acts and their conduct,” but he has insisted that the jurors were free to pursue charges.
A judge gave Cameron until noon Friday to release the recording after originally ordering its release earlier in the week. Cameron had asked for a longer delay to redact personal information about witnesses and other people from the recording, which he said was more than 20 hours long.
After meeting in person for 2 1/2 days, grand jurors indicted Brett Hankison, a former detective, on three counts of “wanton endangerment” last week, saying Hankison had recklessly fired his gun during the raid after Taylor’s boyfriend — who has said he thought intruders were entering the apartment — shot an officer in the leg. Hankison’s rounds did not hit anyone, investigators have said, but some of them flew into an apartment behind Taylor’s, where a pregnant woman, her husband and their 5-year-old child were asleep, leading to the three charges. Hankison has pleaded not guilty.
People swarmed the streets of Louisville and other cities after the grand jury’s decision, demanding that the two officers who shot Taylor face charges. At the height of those protests, a man shot and wounded two Louisville police officers.

An audio recording of the grand jury inquiry into the killing of Breonna Taylor was made public Friday, a rare disclosure that shed light on the evidence jurors considered in the proceedings.
The recordings, which run about 15 hours long, were filed in court by the Kentucky attorney general, Daniel Cameron, and The New York Times is in the process of reviewing the audio, which captured interviews with witnesses, audio of 911 calls and other evidence presented to jurors over 2 1/2 days.
The audio files do not include statements or recommendations from prosecutors about which charges they think should be brought against the officers. Cameron has said that jurors were told that the two officers who shot Taylor were justified in their actions. Ultimately, the jurors indicted a former officer last week on three charges of endangering Taylor’s neighbors by firing into their home during a raid of her apartment in March but did not charge either of the officers who shot her.
“As is customary in the recording of grand jury proceedings, juror deliberations and prosecutor recommendations and statements were not recorded, as they are not evidence,” Cameron said in a statement. He has insisted that the 12 jurors were given “all of the evidence” and were free to pursue additional charges.
His release of the audiotapes came after a grand juror filed a court motion asking for the proceedings to be made public and accusing Cameron of using the jurors to deflect blame over the decision.
Grand jurors are given broad powers to request evidence, call witnesses and determine which charges to pursue, but prosecutors often closely guide the jurors, presenting them with certain charges and telling them about their own roles. The process almost always remains secret.
After meeting in person, grand jurors indicted Brett Hankison, a former detective, on three counts of “wanton endangerment” last week, saying Hankison had recklessly fired his gun during the raid after Taylor’s boyfriend — who has said he thought intruders were entering the apartment — shot an officer in the leg.
Hankison’s rounds did not hit anyone, investigators have said, but some of them flew into an apartment behind Taylor’s, leading to the three charges. Hankison has pleaded not guilty.
An officer who shot Taylor described a chaotic scene.
Detective Myles Cosgrove, who the FBI said fired the shot that killed Taylor, described a disorienting scene of flashing lights as officers breached the door and seemed to suggest uncertainty about exactly what happened.
“I know that I have fired,” he said during an interview he gave police investigators last month that was played for the grand jury. “I just sensed that I’ve fired.”
But, he added, “It’s like a surreal thing. If you told me I didn’t do something at that time, I’d believe you. If you told me I did do something, I’d probably believe you, too.”
As soon as he got to the doorway, Cosgrove said, he was “overwhelmed with bright flashes and darkness. And what I describe as a movie reel that’s doing that ticking where you see white and black, white and black.”
Cosgrove said that Sgt. John Mattingly, who was shot in the leg during the raid, fell to the ground and that he had to step over his wounded colleague.
“I know John, my friend that I’ve known for 15 years, has been shot in this confined space,” Cosgrove said. “And I know this person is down, and I sense that there’s still these gunshots happening due to those bright lights. I can’t even explain what it is.”
Cosgrove said he also saw a shadow of a person, a “larger than normal human shadow,” when they raided the apartment and he saw flashing lights.
Jurors raised questions about some of the evidence.
The first witness was an investigator for the attorneygeneral’s office, who presented photos and videos of the scene, including the body camera videos of three officers who arrived after the shots were fired. The questioning was led by Barbara Maines Whaley, an assistant attorney general.
Grand jurors asked whether Kenneth Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend, had been named in the search warrant (he had not), what exactly the officers saw when the apartment door opened, and whether the officers executing the warrant were aware that police had already found Jamarcus Glover, who was the target of an illegal drug investigation.
Glover was Taylor’s ex-boyfriend, and he was in custody by the time they raided her apartment. At times, the jurors’ questions suggested they were skeptical of what they were being shown: One asked about the time stamps on the video. Another asked why they had not seen the room where the gun was found; the investigator said that would be shown in a different video.
Officers said police knocked and announced themselves before the raid.
Grand jurors heard at least two Louisville police officers who were at the raid on Taylor’s apartment say the group knocked and announced their presence several times before breaking down the door, according to a recording of the proceedings released Friday.
Those accounts, which have been questioned by several of Taylor’s neighbors and her boyfriend, were included among roughly 15 hours of audio filed by the attorney general Friday, which includes interviews heard by the grand jury over several days last week.
Cosgrove, one of the two officers who shot Taylor, said that a neighbor came outside and got into an argument with Brett Hankison, a former officer who fired his weapon during the raid and whom the grand jury indicted on a charge of endangering Taylor’s neighbors.
The unidentified neighbor yelled at them, “something about leave her alone, there was some girl there,” Cosgrove said in an interview with police investigators last month that was played for the grand jury.
He said officers were outside knocking for 90 seconds and that the volume escalated from “gentle knocking” to “forceful pounding” to pounding while yelling “police.”
Another officer at the raid, Detective Michael Nobles, told police investigators he heard movement and voices, including a female voice, inside the apartment before police entered.
Nobles, who held the battering ram that broke through Taylor’s door, said he stood at the door, knocking and announcing himself as police for one or two minutes before he used the battering ram to force his way into Taylor’s apartment. His interview was also played for grand jurors. He said it took three knocks with the battering ram to break down the door completely.
The first blow hit the handle, he said. The second broke the door but left it still on the hinges. The third broke down the door completely.
When he entered, Nobles said it was “pitch black” and that Mattingly, one of the officers who shot Taylor, was quickly shot in the leg after the team entered the building.
In previous interviews with The Times, 11 of 12 of Taylor’s neighbors said they never heard police identify themselves. One neighbor said he heard the group say “police” just once.
The detective who was indicted appeared to think someone in the apartment had a semi-automatic weapon.
Grand jurors were played recordings of radio calls from Hankison, the detective who fired blindly from outside the apartment and has been charged with wanton endangerment, as well as 911 calls that came in after the shooting began.
“Officer down on Springfield!” Hankison shouted into the radio at 12:43 a.m.
The calls suggest that Hankison, who was fired after the shooting for violating department procedure, believed that Mattingly had been wounded by someone with an “AR” who was “barricaded” inside the apartment.
Hankison’s reference to an “AR” on the call appears to be a reference to either an assault rile or the AR-15, a type of a military-style semi-automatic rifle.
In fact, investigators later said, Mattingly was struck by a 9-millimeter round fired by Kenneth Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend, who has said he mistook the officers for intruders.
One officer was charged with ‘wanton endangerment.’ Here’s what that means.
The only charges brought by the grand jury were three counts of “wanton endangerment in the first degree” against Hankison for his actions during the raid.
Under Kentucky law, a person commits that crime when he or she “wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person” and does so “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.” Other states may use terms like “reckless endangerment” for an equivalent offense.
But the charges against Hankison are not for killing Taylor. None of the 10 shots he fired are known to have struck her. Instead, the Kentucky attorney general said the former detective was charged by the grand jury because the shots he fired had passed through Taylor’s apartment walls into a neighboring apartment, endangering three people there.
Hankison is charged with one count for each of the neighboring apartment’s occupants: a pregnant woman, her husband and their 5-year-old child, who were asleep. They were not hit by the shots.
The crime is a Class D felony in Kentucky, which means it can carry a sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine on conviction for each count.
A person can be guilty of wanton endangerment even if they did not intend to harm anyone or to commit a crime; it is sufficient to recklessly disregard the peril that one’s actions create.
Hankison was fired from the force. During the raid, he fired into her apartment from outside, through a sliding glass patio door and a window that were covered with blinds, in violation of a department policy that requires officers to have a line of sight.
Protesters have demanded justice in the Breonna Taylor case for months.
The name Breonna Taylor has echoed across the nation for months as demonstrators demanded police be held accountable for her death.
Outrage over Taylor’s death has spread far from Louisville, with protests drawing crowds in cities across the United States, beginning in the spring and continuing throughout the summer. Rallying cries of “Say Her Name” have been ubiquitous at the rallies.
The police killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died in May after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer’s knee, brought renewed attention to deadly episodes involving police, including Taylor’s death, and fueled Black Lives Matter protests that persisted throughout the summer.
In September, when the grand jury announced no charges against the officers who killed Taylor, protesters poured into the streets of Louisville with renewed strength and anger, demanding stronger charges. The protesters called for all three officers, who are white, to be held to account for Taylor’s death.
Taylor’s family, too, has pleaded for justice, pushing for criminal charges against the officers. Taylor’s case has also been the center of campaigns from several celebrities and athletes, some of whom have dedicated their seasons to keeping a spotlight on her case.

A President’s Positive Test and the Year That Won’t Let Up

Sure, 2020. Why not?
President Donald Trump’s pre-election turn as the world’s most famous coronavirus case is at once stunning, startling and somehow spiritually consistent with the bleaker-than-fiction course of this endless, relentless year.
A campaign season that began with the relative quaintness of an impeachment inquiry has advanced to a level of crisis that threatens the health of America’s citizens, institutions and democratic processes. And that was before the health of its president became a matter of urgent concern early Friday.
The grim irony of this arc is impossible to avoid. At the start, Trump predicted the virus would disappear like a miracle. He shared epidemiologically indefensible visions of packed churches on Easter. He pushed dubious remedies for a disease that has now killed more than 200,000 of his constituents.
“What do you have to lose?” he asked this spring, promoting an unproven treatment, hydroxychloroquine, that he said he had taken himself, just because.
But then, this has generally been Trump’s approach to risk, subsuming those around him — in business and in politics — who have historically shouldered most of it.
Pining for the glow of insta-feedback from supporters, Trump resumed campaign rallies against the advice of public health experts. Guests who registered on his website were asked to acknowledge that they “voluntarily assume all risks.”
To the extent that the president has focused on his own health publicly, it has often been to swat away suggestions that he was concealing any maladies, given an unannounced and underexplained visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last year and widely shared footage of him walking gingerly down a ramp.
“They say there’s something wrong with our president!” Trump swaggered at his indoor Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally in June, litigating the ramp affair for some 15 minutes. “I’ll let you know if there’s something wrong.”
There’s something wrong. The man who repeatedly assured Americans that he had a plan — and whose administration repeatedly failed to demonstrate as much — now sits in the White House as a septuagenarian patient of high actuarial alarm.
As recently as Thursday night, he had said that “the end of the pandemic is in sight.” At the debate Tuesday, he mocked Joe Biden for wearing “the biggest mask I’ve ever seen” and said his Democratic opponent had forgone large gatherings only because “nobody will show up” to see him.
“We’ve had no negative effect,” the president said of his own rallies.
There was no heap of wood to knock on. Perhaps Trump, by turns the superstitious type and a fatalistic dice-thrower, would not have bothered with such an exercise anyway.
Yet the iron rule of 2020 seems to be that every Chekhovian gun will be fired — and then a few more, scattershot into the night, lest anyone get too comfortable with a mere pandemic-cum-protest-cum-wildfire national epic that does not include a commander-in-chief-in-quarantine.
The Trump age has supplied no shortage of previous late-hour pronouncements from the president, although those have more often tended toward the comparatively banal: a television program he didn’t like, a Democrat he felt compelled to needle, the unveiling of the word “covfefe.”
For many Friday, the response to his positive test was instead the kind of psychic doom-spiraling that has felt endemic to the era, kicking up questions that surely yield meager search engine traffic on happier days:
Are there emergency ballot rules if a candidate becomes incapacitated?
What is the blast radius of spittle on an unruly debate stage?
Has anyone checked on Mike Pence? On Nancy Pelosi?
“We will get through this TOGETHER!” Trump tweeted after midnight.
If his speaking voice had struck some as a bit raspy Thursday, his social media voice seemed unencumbered so far.
And maybe there was some collective comfort in that, just this once, and in the prospect that the expected can still happen occasionally. Given the rhythms of these four years, it was probably inevitable that Trump would find himself so personally, corporeally tethered to the signal news event of the times.
This is a president who stared into an eclipse, feuded with the pope, walked in front of the queen. He has a way of dominating his circumstances.
It’s just that usually, that’s the way he likes it.

On Monday, Trump Updated the Nation on Virus Strategy. By Friday, He Tested Positive

WASHINGTON — On Monday, President Donald Trump updated the nation on the administration’s coronavirus testing strategy and announced a plan to distribute 150 million rapid tests. By early Friday, he had the virus himself.
On the days in between, Trump interacted with scores of staff members, donors and supporters. Even the woman he has nominated to the Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, has been at the White House this week.
The president held preparation sessions with staff members for his debate Tuesday night with former Vice President Joe Biden, in the tight quarters of the West Wing, where officials who are tested regularly have relied on negative results as an excuse to forgo masks and other safety precautions.
He attended a closed-door fundraiser at a private home of a wealthy supporter in Minneapolis, and he appeared before thousands of people at a rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where most of the crowd did not wear masks. He also shared a stage with Biden.
It is not yet clear when and how Trump contracted the virus. The president and the first lady, Melania Trump, said they had both tested positive hours after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, had also tested positive. Hicks received the diagnosis after she began experiencing symptoms Wednesday while attending the president’s rally in Minnesota. Trump kept his appearance there to about 45 minutes, roughly half the length of one of his typical rally speeches.
Early Friday, it was still unclear how many other aides who had come into close contact with Trump had tested positive, but the White House said its medical unit was conducting contact tracing. Top advisers to the president described themselves as in a state of shock and said they expected a number of additional cases among people in Trump’s orbit. White House officials had hoped to keep the news about Hicks from becoming public, to no avail.
Trump, for his part, has been fatalistic when talking with associates about whether he or others would get sick, describing the possibility as a roll of the dice. His week included a series of events in which he played down the virus in front of crowds large and small, all without wearing a mask.
On Monday in the Rose Garden, Trump boasted about the progress he said that his administration had made toward increasing testing capacity.
“I say, and I’ll say it all the time: We’re rounding the corner,” Trump said.
He was joined by Vice President Mike Pence; Alex Azar, the health secretary; Betsy DeVos, the education secretary; and the chief executive of Abbott Laboratories, Robert Ford.
On Tuesday, Trump was accompanied by all of his adult children and senior members of his White House and campaign staff on Air Force One en route to Cleveland for the first presidential debate. None of them wore masks as they were seen boarding and deplaning. Bill Stepien, the president’s campaign manager, was seen on board without a mask, and then was spotted getting into a staff van with Hicks.
Onstage in Cleveland, Trump mocked Biden for his habit of wearing a mask in public.
“I think masks are OK,” Trump said, adding: “I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks when needed.”
The president then addressed Biden, saying: “I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from them and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.”
Few in the president’s circle appeared to be taking any precautions on the Cleveland trip. Those on Air Force One on Tuesday evening included Jason Miller, the campaign strategist; Stephen Miller, the White House policy adviser; Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff; Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser who tested positive for the virus in July; and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. All were seen on the plane without masks.
On the flight home from the debate, Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, could be seen in a staff cabin, speaking animatedly to his colleagues with no mask covering his face. Upon landing at Joint Base Andrews in the middle of a heavy rainstorm, Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a senior campaign official and the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, huddled to share an umbrella as they crossed the tarmac, talking and laughing. Guilfoyle tested positive for the virus over the summer.
In contrast, the East Wing has taken a different approach to safety. Melania Trump, who posted a photograph of herself wearing a mask on Twitter before her husband reluctantly and halfheartedly endorsed the practice, has made the majority of her staff members work from home, with aides entering the building on a rotating basis. When she has traveled with the president, she has done so without members of her own advance staff, to avoid more exposure to the virus.
After the debate, the president’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, posted a rare photograph of herself with her stepmother, along with Tiffany Trump and Lara Trump, huddled together backstage, wearing masks. But the family members removed their masks in the debate hall shortly before the event began.
On Wednesday evening, a small coterie of advisers spoke with one another about Hicks’ symptoms as they flew home aboard Air Force One. Hicks was isolated in a separate cabin. She exited from the back of the plane, as opposed to the front.
By Thursday, it was clear that something unusual was happening at the White House, aides said. Several staff members who have avoided masks were suddenly wearing them.
On Thursday evening, before his own diagnosis was made public, Trump sounded raspy on a call with Iowa voters and in an interview later with Sean Hannity on Fox News. Some aides chalked it up to a busy week of campaigning.

On Thursday afternoon, President Donald Trump claimed that he had won this week’s debate against former Vice President Joe Biden, then veered into complaining about how the Commission on Presidential Debates might change procedures for their next event to avoid him repeatedly talking over his opponent again.
“Why would I allow the debate commission to change the rules for the second and third debates when I easily won last time?” Trump tweeted, raising the prospect that he might not go ahead with their second scheduled debate.
A short time later, his political advisers devoted a 20-minute campaign call with reporters to denouncing commission members by name and accusing them of “bias.” The advisers insisted that Trump would take part in future debates, but the complaining hardly exuded confidence.
A day earlier, Trump was insisting, too, that he was being denied his due for his chaotic and widely panned debate performance. At a campaign rally that night in Duluth, Minnesota, he also complained that he had not received sufficient media coverage for nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.
“We got nothing!” he told the crowd.
Over nearly four years in office, Trump has frequently changed his positions on issues, issued conflicting statements and shuffled through a revolving cast of staff.
The one constant has been the president portraying himself as a victim at every turn.
Be it congressional Democrats or Republican foes like the late Sen. John McCain, the news media or the standards enforcers at Twitter, the impeachment inquiry or, now, the debate commission, Trump has repeatedly blamed others for problems and self-inflicted wounds, something he hopes will appeal to a shared sense of grievance among his supporters.
That instinct is now increasingly on display as he faces ominous polling showing him behind in his reelection campaign, a position that aides say is unfathomable for someone who has long staked his personal brand on “winning.” Trump, some advisers inside and outside the White House say, has telegraphed to them that he is scared of losing — and in particular, scared of losing to Biden, whom he does not respect.
Trump has taken to describing shadows on almost every wall: false claims that the election is “rigged” against him, complaints that the coronavirus pandemic was “unfair” to his record on the economy, insistence that people who disagree with him within his own government about policy matters are part of a concerted effort to undermine him.
He has lobbed accusations at Democrats who want more extensive public health measures, and who haven’t agreed to Republican terms on an aid package for people affected by the coronavirus, usually saying they are trying to harm his reelection prospects.
Even the personal troubles of Trump’s former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, whom the president has attacked in private for months and whom Trump demoted over the summer, became a vehicle for assigning blame. When Trump was told a few days ago that Parscale had been detained by the police for allegedly threatening to harm himself, the president ordered aides to write a statement blaming “Democrats” and “Republicans in name only” who had been critical of Parscale, according to two people familiar with what took place.
Claiming to be the victim of the political establishment has been key to Trump’s political persona since he entered the 2016 presidential race. And if he loses this time, he has spent months laying the groundwork for large swaths of voters to be receptive to his claim that it was wrongly taken from him.
Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., called Trump’s play for self-pity “a two-edged sword.” It has been successful in harnessing his base of voters who see him as fighting for them, but not necessarily with others whom he still needs to convince.
“I think it is important for the president to keep his base mobilized and tell some independent voters that the media is unfair to him,” he said. “But he can overplay that hand, so he has to watch it.”
Avoiding responsibility has been a trademark of the Trump White House on matters big and small, from the response to the coronavirus pandemic to Trump’s false claims about specific incidents of voting problems. As a businessman, too, Trump’s modus operandi was to deflect blame for anything that went wrong. But in a pandemic, when more than 200,000 people have died and millions have lost their jobs, Trump’s complaints about the system being unfair to him are discordant at best.
“The only way to convince people that you’re not a loser is to convince them that you’re a victim,” said Amanda Carpenter, a columnist for the Bulwark and a former communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. “Having something be rigged against him is the ultimate ego protector, because he never has to admit that he lost.”
But Trump’s habit of blaming others has done little to erase the forbidding polling reality he faces against Biden.
Both nationwide and in most crucial swing states, a slight majority of voters tend to disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, as they have throughout most of his term in office. And it looks increasingly unlikely that voters will buy his argument that Biden presents a dangerous alternative.
Polls over the past week have shown Trump trailing Biden by anywhere from 5 to 10 points nationwide. And his fortunes are no better in many key swing states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona: Recent polls from The New York Times and Siena College showed Biden with an 8 to 10 point lead among likely voters in each of those three states. With one small exception, no credible survey this month has shown Trump ahead in any of them.
The president finds himself playing defense in every one of the states that he flipped four years ago, including in Iowa, where a Times/Siena poll this month gave Biden a three-point edge. Even in southern states that were key to his win in 2016, such as North Carolina and Florida, polls show him in a dogfight with Biden, hobbled — as he is elsewhere — by his stark unpopularity among women and his inability to maintain the confidence of suburban voters who had narrowly swung in his favor four years ago.
His angry performance in the debate Tuesday did little to quiet the concerns of such voters. A CNN snap poll conducted that night among registered voters found that by more than 2 to 1, debate viewers thought Biden had been the winner.
And in a reminder of how unpopular his pugilistic, taunting style remains with most voters, respondents said by an equally wide margin — 67 to 32% — that the president’s attacks on Biden that night had been unfair.
The debate commission is expected to announce some changes soon to the format for the remaining two presidential debates. Whether Trump uses such changes as justification to skip his next debate, on Oct. 15, remains to be seen.
Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist, said that he is sympathetic to some of Trump’s complaints, particularly about his media coverage.
But he also described errors made by Trump that are followed by people rallying to his side, comforting him and then fighting for him — without the president ever acknowledging that he was the one who kicked off that kind of exhausting cycle.
“It’s statistically impossible for someone to be totally the victim 100% of the time,” Jennings said. “Sometimes you brought it on yourself.”

HONG KONG — One year ago, China’s National Day on Oct. 1 was a day of protest and turmoil in Hong Kong. Demonstrators set fires and blockaded streets. Police responded with tear gas and pepper spray. One officer shot a young demonstrator with a live bullet.
The holiday Thursday once again brought protesters to the streets of Hong Kong. This time, however, their numbers were far smaller, and they were smothered by thousands of police officers. The police corralled and searched dozens of people at a time, effectively quashing all but the briefest expressions of dissent.
The stark contrast from one year to the next shows how Hong Kong authorities have used social distancing rules, an overwhelming police presence and a sweeping national security law imposed on the city by Beijing at the end of June to silence pro-democracy rallies. Public discontent remains high in Hong Kong, but displaying it is increasingly risky.
The police had banned protests Thursday, citing coronavirus concerns, so activists looked for creative ways to skirt the restrictions. Some demonstrations looked more like performance art than the seas of people with thunderous chants that were hallmarks of last year’s protests.
Several demonstrators stood in the streets of Causeway Bay, a shopping district, holding up copies of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper, as though they were reading them. The papers showed full-page ads with slogans like “Protect the children, hold on to your conscience.” A teenage boy played popular protest tunes on a recorder at a crowded intersection as some demonstrators sang along.
The police targeted many young people, including some who wore black, a color associated with the protest movement, herding them behind a security cordon near luxury stores. A number of older residents and people clutching grocery bags were also rounded up.
Officers unfurled blue banners that warned against unauthorized gatherings. They hoisted purple banners when some people chanted protest slogans that authorities have said could potentially violate the new security law.
By midafternoon, police had blocked off large parts of Causeway Bay and prevented pedestrians from lingering. They arrested at least 60 people, including two district council members, on suspicion of taking part in an unauthorized assembly.
The police said they had seized a sharp knife as well as rods, masks and protest stickers. Officers were also investigating reports that Molotov cocktails had been thrown onto a major road in the Kowloon district.
Before the holiday, Luo Huining, the director of China’s powerful representative office in Hong Kong, said it was important for the semiautonomous region’s young people and civil servants to feel more patriotic. He called for more education on topics like national security, Chinese history and culture.
“As a Chinese person, loving the country is not a choice, but a duty and the right course,” he said in a speech Wednesday.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said during a National Day gathering Thursday that the relative calm showed the value of the national security legislation.
“Over the past three months, the plain truth is, and it is obvious to see, that stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded,” she said.
Lam also asserted, again, that the city’s residents continued to enjoy basic rights and freedoms. Activists and academics have challenged the government’s stance, noting that the security law — with vaguely defined political crimes like subversion — was being used to target speech that had long been protected.
Some protesters had planned to rally in support of 12 people from Hong Kong who were being held in the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen on accusations of illegal boundary crossing. The group, which included people who had been charged in Hong Kong for acts committed during last year’s protests, had sought to escape to Taiwan by boat in August when they were caught by the Chinese coast guard.
On Wednesday, prosecutors in Shenzhen authorized the continued detention of the 12 Hong Kong residents. Two of them were charged with organizing an illegal boundary crossing, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison, while the remaining 10 were charged with crossing a boundary illegally, which carries up to a year in prison. That means they are likely to face trial in mainland China.
The police warned protesters against violating a ban on groups of more than four people but did not interfere when a group of a few dozen government supporters gathered in the Wan Chai district to sing the Chinese national anthem and wave national flags.
