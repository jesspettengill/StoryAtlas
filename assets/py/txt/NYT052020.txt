In Boston, thousands of people took to streets and parks in peaceful protests against police brutality. In Minneapolis, a tanker truck sped into a crowd on a highway overpass as hundreds of demonstrators scattered for safety. And in New York, a tense mood followed a night of street battles, burned cars and hundreds of arrests.
The United States remained a tinderbox of emotion, anger and continued violence Sunday, the sixth day of nationwide unrest since the death of yet another black man at the hands of the police. The death of the man, George Floyd, last week in Minneapolis set off days of protracted protest that have swept across the country, with tumultuous demonstrations from New York City to Los Angeles and dozens of cities in between.
In Santa Monica, California, looters shoved aside barricades to vandalize and ransack stores Sunday, while in nearby Huntington Beach, protesters against police brutality clashed with right-wing groups. And in Louisville, Kentucky, a tense confrontation in the middle of a crowded street was partially defused when a black woman stepped forward and offered a policeman in riot gear a hug. They embraced for nearly a minute.
In Washington, thousands of protesters gathered again near the White House, where an angry crowd Friday night had so unnerved the Secret Service that agents abruptly rushed President Donald Trump to an underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks.
Philadelphia announced a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew after a day of protests and looting there, while Washington’s mayor set one for 11 p.m. and Arizona’s governor declared a state of emergency and ordered a nightly 8 p.m. curfew that he said would be in place for a week
At least 75 cities have seen protests in recent days, and the number of mayors and governors imposing curfews — already more than two dozen — continued to grow. It is the first time so many local leaders have simultaneously issued such orders in the face of civic unrest since 1968, after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
On Saturday, hundreds of people were arrested across the country as clashes erupted between protesters and the police in dozens of states. In some cities, the authorities appeared to fire rubber bullets and other projectiles with little or no provocation. In New York City, two police vehicles surged forward into a crowd of demonstrators, some of whom were blocking the street and pelting the cars with debris.
Sunday’s protests marked the sixth day of outrage since Floyd died as a white police officer — since fired and charged with third-degree murder — pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.
National Guard soldiers were posted in Atlanta and Minneapolis and California moved troops into Los Angeles.
In Atlanta, one day after video showed them using stun guns on two black college students and then dragging them out of their car, two Atlanta police officers were fired for what the city’s mayor said constituted “excessive force.”
The actions of the Atlanta officers came amid intensifying scrutiny of how law enforcement was responding to demonstrators.
In Brooklyn, two police SUVs plowed into protesters Saturday evening, drawing criticism from Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York.
“I didn’t like what I saw one bit. I did not want to ever see something like that,” said de Blasio, who also complimented the city’s police officers for generally showing a “tremendous amount of restraint.”
In Salt Lake City, officers in riot gear trying to clear onlookers shoved a man with a cane to the ground. And in Minneapolis, a video appeared to show officers yelling at people on their porches to get inside and firing paint canisters at them when they did not. “Light them up,” one officer said.
In Philadelphia, police in riot gear and an armored vehicle used pepper spray to try to repel rioters and looters, who breached a Target store and a Foot Locker store, according to photos posted on social media.
Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that the United States would designate a group of far-left anti-fascism activists as a terrorist organization, a declaration that lacked any clear legal authority, as his administration sought to blame the group for violent protests across the nation over the weekend.
“The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,” Trump wrote.
But it was not clear that Trump’s declaration would have any real meaning beyond his characteristic attempts to stir a culture-war controversy, attract attention and please his conservative base.
Nevertheless, in a statement after Trump’s tweet, Attorney General William Barr said the FBI would use its partnerships with state and local police to identify violent protesters, whom he also called domestic terrorists.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, appeared in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday, where he visited the site of Saturday’s protests and toured businesses damaged during the demonstrations.
In a photo posted to social media, Biden, wearing a mask, is kneeling down to speak with a man and a child.
“We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,” he wrote on Instagram. “We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us. The only way to bear this pain is to turn all that anguish to purpose.”
National Guard commanders say troops are meant only to keep the peace.
As Trump painted the National Guard as key to restoring order and taunted Democratic governors and mayors for not calling out the troops, generals in charge of troops in three states said Sunday afternoon that they had been only in support roles and had not used any force to put down the civil unrest.
The leaders of the Minnesota, Georgia and Colorado National Guards made clear that while troops had probably had a deterrent effect, the bulk of the credit for containing the violence went to local police officers. National Guard forces have been used mostly to secure buildings, allowing more police officers to move to the front lines, they said.
“Our purpose is to allow our local law enforcement professionals to do their jobs,” said Gen. Jon Jensen, leader of Minnesota’s National Guard. “We do that by relieving them of items like infrastructure security.”
The forces in Minnesota and Georgia are armed, while the Colorado troops have only nonlethal weaponry. The generals did not describe under what conditions they would use force, only that they would be proportional and used in self-defense.
Mayors call for “peace, not patience.”
Melvin Carter, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, said Sunday that what his city needed to help restore order after days of protests was not military assistance but assurances that someone would be held accountable for the death of Floyd.
Speaking on the CNN program “State of the Union,” Carter called for “peace, not patience,” a phrase also used by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta on the same program.
Referring to the video of Floyd’s death that sparked the protests, Carter said, “When all of humanity can look at this video and say, ‘That’s disgusting, that’s unacceptable,’ and yet somehow we have four officers in the video who — three of whom sat there and either helped hold Floyd down or stood guard over the scene while it happened, that is an incredible insult to humanity.”
Carter, whose father is a retired St. Paul police officer, rejected the notion that Floyd’s death was an isolated incident or the work of one rogue officer.
“When you have four officers in the video all responsible for the taking of George Floyd’s life, it points to a culture of normalized, a culture that’s accepted,” he said.
At least 170 businesses had been damaged during protests in St. Paul, he said. Carter called on protesters to channel their frustration and anger into “destroying laws, destroying legal precedents, destroying police union contracts,” instead of burning and looting.
Bottoms warned against allowing the clashes to obscure the reasons for the protests.
“Yesterday, we weren’t talking about George Floyd or Ahmaud Arbery or Breonna Taylor; we were talking about police cars burning in our street,” Bottoms said. “What happens when we have these violent protests and uprisings in our city, we get distracted from what the real issue is. And we need to get back to what the problem is, and that’s the killing of unarmed black people in America.”
Protests spread beyond the U.S. to London and Berlin.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Trafalgar Square in central London on Sunday afternoon and marched toward the U.S. Embassy, the most visible sign so far of popular support overseas for the protests across the United States against police killings of black people.
Holding signs and clapping their hands, protesters gathered in the square in defiance of stay-at-home restrictions in effect across Britain to fight the coronavirus pandemic. They chanted, “I can’t breathe,” “Black lives matter,” and, “No justice, no peace,” before crossing the Thames to march peacefully to the embassy.
The protest march Sunday echoed one Saturday in the Peckham district of South London. Another London march is planned for next Sunday.
Several hundred protesters rallied outside the U.S. Embassy in Berlin on Sunday, holding up signs saying “Justice for George Floyd” and “Stop killing us,” Reuters reported.
A disaster is declared in Texas.
As cities and states brace for more demonstrations in the coming days, authorities have responded by calling in more resources and readjusting previously held plans.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster Sunday, an action that enables him to designate federal agents to serve as Texas peace officers. The Republican governor, who activated the Texas National Guard a day earlier, issued the disaster order after protests in the state’s major cities touched off confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement.
“As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety and protect against property damage or loss,” Abbott said in announcing the disaster declaration. “Every Texan and every American has the right to protest, and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” he said. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive.”
Hundreds of protesters returned to the streets of downtown Austin on Sunday in what were described as largely peaceful demonstrations after sporadic looting and confrontations between police and protesters the previous day.
Sunday’s gatherings took place even after the Austin Justice Coalition canceled plans for an official demonstration. Organizers said they had halted the plans because they were worried about the safety of participants and because protests were being co-opted and made violent by people who were not black.
One woman who attended the gathering Sunday said she had been pepper-sprayed by police, and authorities reported a possible looting incident in an outlying shopping center. But the demonstrations were relatively calm compared with Saturday, when protesters blocked traffic on I-35, set fire to several parked cars and looted businesses on Sixth Street.
Carrying placards with inscriptions such as “Black Futures Matter” and “End Racism,” the demonstrators started out at the state Capitol, marched to city hall several blocks to the south and later returned to the Capitol.
“It’s been peaceful so far,” said Sgt. Victor Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
Chas Moore, executive director of the Austin Justice Coalition, said in a Facebook video that Saturday night, white people had been “burning stuff up in the name of Black Lives Matter” and that there were rumors that attempts would be made to hijack Sunday’s demonstration.
“You are using black pain and you are using fake outrage in the name of Black Lives Matter to go deface and destroy property, which we would then get the blame for,” Moore said. “To those people, to those agitators, we see you, we know who you are, and we’re not going to let you co-opt and colonize this movement like you’ve done everything else.”

They are parallel plagues ravaging America: The coronavirus. And police killings of black men and women.
Jimmy Mills’ life has been upended by both. His barbershop in Midtown Minneapolis was one of many small, black-owned businesses that have struggled to survive the pandemic. But Mills, 56, was hopeful because, after two months shut down, he was due to reopen next week.
Then early Friday, the working-class neighborhood where Mills has cut hair for 12 years went up in flames as chaotic protests over the death of George Floyd and police killings of African-Americans engulfed Minneapolis and cities across the country.
“To have corona, and then this — it’s like a gut shot,” Mills said.
The upheaval sparked by a video capturing Floyd’s agonizing last minutes as a white police officer kneels on his neck is pulsing through an America already ragged with anger and anxiety. Emotions are raw over the toll of a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 people across the country and cost millions of jobs.
Minneapolis residents said outrage and protests in the aftermath of the killing of Floyd were a result of a community being tested repeatedly in recent weeks by both police violence and the virus — and in ways that put America’s deep racial inequalities in stark relief.
The outbreak has inflicted disproportionate economic and health tolls on racial minorities and immigrants in Minneapolis and beyond. Black and Latino workers have been more likely to have lost their jobs. Many others are among the low-paid hourly workers who risk their health by going to work at grocery stores, nursing homes, factories, slaughterhouses and other jobs that cannot be done remotely.
The black community in Minnesota has also been hit hard by cases of the virus, just as African-Americans across the country are being infected and dying at higher rates.
By one estimate, black people accounted for at least 29% of known COVID-19 cases in Minnesota, despite making up about 6% of the state’s population. African-Americans make up 35% of coronavirus cases in Minneapolis, although they are less than 20% of the city’s population.
“There are no words to describe what people are going through,” said state Rep. Mohamud Noor, who represents a district with many Somalis and other immigrants.
His great-uncle died of the coronavirus a few days ago, and Noor said he is losing track of how many other relatives and constituents are dying.
Noor said that the school closures had hurt poorer students without laptops or reliable internet access to take classes online, and that waves of job losses had sent local unemployment rates soaring. Now, with more than 200 businesses damaged or destroyed in the unrest, Noor said he was worried about new waves of foreclosures, job losses and business failures.
“Many people who are poor who didn’t have much, this devastation will really impact them,” Noor said.
Even before the pandemic, the Midtown neighborhood, where buildings were burned, damaged and looted, had been trying to rebuild itself after years of economic hardship. The area is in a historically segregated part of town where some residents had felt neglected. A railway was repurposed into a bike and walking trail that runs through the neighborhood. The Midtown Global Market had sprung up, attracting diners and shoppers to its Hmong, Indian, Moroccan and other international food and crafts.
But now, next door to Mills, the barber, a dollar store and beauty-supply shop have been burned to rubble. The front windows of Mills’ barbershop were smashed, and looters stole his televisions, video equipment and his clippers.
Now, with the power out, water seeping across the floor and phalanxes of police officers and National Guard troops blockading his neighborhood, he does not know when his J-Klips barbershop might reopen.
“Half of the place is condemned,” he said. “Where do we go from here?”
Phillipe Cunningham, a city council member, represents a poor ward in northern Minneapolis with a large black, Hmong and Native American population. He said had spent the past two months fighting to get a coronavirus testing site opened and fielding calls from laid-off workers falling behind on rent and black business owners unable to navigate the maze of federal relief programs.
On Friday, Cunningham drove around surveying damaged buildings, helping some of the same business owners board up their storefronts and trying to prevent looters from breaking into stores.
“We were already struggling,” Cunningham said.
In many pockets of the city where the virus seemed to be more concentrated, residents have not had access to masks and hand sanitizer, even as the mayor ordered masks be worn when inside businesses as of last week, said Jia Starr Brown, pastor of First Covenant Church in downtown Minneapolis.
Even healthy people in Minneapolis were feeling anxious after a long stretch of being holed up in their homes as spring arrived; a limited reopening of businesses was not set to begin until Monday. That loosening of restrictions came with a long list of social-distancing and sanitation rules.
Brown spoke as she stepped away from a protest outside a county building Friday afternoon, saying she was heartened to see so many people attend rallies calling for justice for Floyd, even when doing so was a health risk.
“This is about collective widespread grief, and how great must the grief be that people would risk their livelihoods?” she said. “Who we are as a people is greater than the risk to be out there. This is urgent. This isn’t about just our own individual lives as black people, but this is about our futures and children.”
Many young people, especially minorities, were gig-economy workers holding two or three part-time jobs that evaporated when the outbreak hit, said Tyler Sit, pastor of the New City Church, which is blocks away from where Floyd died and from the Third Precinct that was burned in the protests. They were left jobless and worried about not having benefits should they become ill.
Sitting at home during lockdown, with no work and no prospect of finding work for the foreseeable future, he said, they were more aware than usual of news reports and then had the time to react by taking to the streets.
“I hear messages from community members trying to deliberate whether or not they’re going to show up. They don’t want to catch COVID-19 and spread COVID-19 if they happen to be an asymptomatic carrier,” he said. “But there’s a deep feeling of we have to do something because our city is burning.”
In Atlanta, Denver, New York and beyond, protesters have also emerged despite the pandemic. They have slipped on face masks and bandannas to guard against the coronavirus, as well as tear gas.
Rashawn Ray, a sociologist and fellow at The Brookings Institution, said one crucial difference between the two plagues is that the coronavirus, like past diseases, may one day dissipate with a vaccine or medical breakthrough.
“We’ve never gotten to a place where racism is not a significant part of everyone’s life in the United States,” he said.

Will Protests Spark a 2nd Viral Wave? [With graphic(s)]

Mass protests against police brutality that have brought thousands of people out of their homes and onto the streets in cities across America are raising the specter of new coronavirus outbreaks, prompting political leaders, physicians and public health experts to warn that the crowds could cause a surge in cases.
While many political leaders affirmed the right of protesters to express themselves, they urged the demonstrators to wear face masks and maintain social distancing, both to protect themselves and to prevent further community spread of the virus.
More than 100,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. People of color have been particularly hard hit, with rates of hospitalizations and deaths among black Americans far exceeding those of whites.
The protests in dozens of cities have been spurred most recently by the death last week of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. But the unrest and outrage spilling out into the streets from one city to the next also reflects the dual, cumulative tensions arising from decades of killings by police and the sudden losses of family and friends from the virus.
The spontaneous outpouring of protests are occurring as many states have warily begun reopening after weeks of stay-at-home orders with millions of Americans unemployed. Restaurants, schools, beaches and parks are under scrutiny as the public tentatively practices new forms of social distancing.
In Los Angeles, where demonstrations led to the closing of virus testing sites Saturday, Mayor Eric Garcetti warned that the protests could become “super-spreader events,” referring to the types of gatherings, usually held in indoor settings, that can lead to an explosion of secondary infections.
Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, expressed concern that his state would see a spike in cases in about two weeks, which is about how long it takes for symptoms to emerge after someone is infected, while Atlanta’s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, advised people who were out protesting “to go get a COVID test this week.”
Some infectious disease experts were reassured by the fact that the protests were held outdoors, saying the open air settings could mitigate the risk of transmission. In addition, many of the demonstrators were wearing masks, and in some places, they appeared to be avoiding clustering too closely.
“The outdoor air dilutes the virus and reduces the infectious dose that might be out there, and if there are breezes blowing, that further dilutes the virus in the air,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “There was literally a lot of running around, which means they’re exhaling more profoundly, but also passing each other very quickly.”
The crowds tended to be on the younger side, he noted, and younger adults generally have better outcomes if they become ill, though there is a risk they could transmit the virus to relatives and household members who may be older and more susceptible.
But others were more concerned about the risk posed by the marches. Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian who studies pandemics, likened the protest crowds to the bond parades held in American cities like Philadelphia and Detroit in the midst of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which were often followed by spikes in influenza cases.
“Yes, the protests are outside, but they are all really close to each other, and in those cases, being outside doesn’t protect you nearly as much,” Markel said. “Public gatherings are public gatherings — it doesn’t matter what you’re protesting or cheering. That’s one reason we’re not having large baseball games and may not have college football this fall.”
Though many protesters were wearing masks, others were not. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets spread when people talk, cough or sneeze; screaming and shouting slogans during a protest can accelerate the spread, Markel said.
Tear gas and pepper spray, which police have used to disperse crowds, cause people to tear up and cough, and increase respiratory secretions from the eyes, nose and mouth, further enhancing the possibility of transmission. Police efforts to move crowds through tight urban areas can result in corralling people closer together, or end up penning people into tight spaces.
And emotions have been running high, Markel said. “People get lost in the moment, and they lose awareness of who is close to them, who’s not, who’s wearing a mask, who’s not,” he said.
The biggest concern is the one that has bedeviled infectious disease experts since the pandemic began, and it is the coronavirus’ secret weapon: that it can be transmitted by people who do not display any symptoms and feel healthy enough to participate in protests.
“There are a huge number of asymptomatic carriers, and that makes it hugely risky,” Markel said.
Dr. Ashish Jha, a professor and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said more than half of coronavirus infections are spread by people who are asymptomatic, including some who are infected but never go on to develop symptoms and others who do not yet know they are sick.
Arresting, transporting or jailing protesters increases the potential for spreading the virus. Jha called on protesters to refrain from violence, and urged police to exercise restraint.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, appearing on CBS’ “Face The Nation” on Sunday, also predicted the protests would lead to new “chains of transmission.”
He said social and economic inequities, including poor access to health care, discrimination in health care settings, greater reliance on public transportation and differences in employment were all factors leading to a greater burden of COVID-19 disease among people of color.
“Stopping the pandemic is going to depend on our ability to take care of our most medically and socially vulnerable,” Gottlieb said. “We absolutely need to resolve these underlying problems to eliminate the risk of pandemic spreading of the epidemic."

WASHINGTON — As hundreds of people surged in front of the White House on Sunday to protest the police killing of George Floyd for a third straight night, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser ordered an 11 p.m. curfew and activated the National Guard. At 8 p.m., troops could be seen marching across the South Lawn of the White House as President Donald Trump sat inside, tweeting about law and order.
Protesters reclaimed a northern slice of Lafayette Park that had been the dividing line with police Saturday night. As they got closer to the White House, teenagers covered a park bathroom structure in graffiti like “AMERIKKKA” and climbed atop for a better view. Police periodically lobbed tear gas into the crowd and announced over a megaphone their intent to push the protesters back. But as night fell, they had yet to succeed.
Sunday began with workers scrambling to secure businesses in the heart of the nation’s capital, before what many feared may be another night of fury over Floyd’s killing.
“I was called at two o’clock in the morning and again this morning,” said Bryant Woltz, a glass contractor boarding up the Bombay Club, ordinarily the scene of power lunches between politicians and the media elite. “They said we need all hands on deck, this is an emergency.”
Across from the Bombay Club, another restaurant, the Oval Room, was graffitied with “THE RICH AREN’T SAFE ANYMORE!” Nearby at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce building, which had been set on fire and had its windows smashed, Bill Voge, 35, was hastily slapping gray paint over more graffiti. “We’re trying to recover as best we can from what transpired last night, and then tonight it’s supposed to be the same thing, so we’ll probably be back tomorrow, doing the same thing,” he said, paint roller in hand.
The Saturday protests had begun peacefully at 2 p.m., opposite the Justice Department. “We want charges,” an organizer shouted into a megaphone. “We want convictions. No more acquittals. We want these people to be held accountable.” Protesters marched down to the National Mall, snaked around the Reflecting Pool and came to a stop at the statue of Ulysses S. Grant on horseback. There, with the Capitol building in the background, they chanted “George Floyd!” and the names of other victims of police brutality, including Breonna Taylor and Philando Castile.
“We built this country, and it’s time for people to respect us,” said Pamela Alston, 31, an insurance underwriter from Southeast Washington. Jarrell Slade, 26, a school counselor and Washington native, said: “I’m fed up. I’m tired of going on social media, talking to my friends and family, and having everything be centered on black death.”
Malik Harris, 23, a global studies major at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, rented a house in Washington with friends for the weekend to join the protest. “I’m supposed to be doing my homework right now for the summer semester,” he said. “But I definitely want to be present for everything.”
Later in the afternoon, crowds swelled on H Street near the White House and then took off through the streets. They marched past the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, blaring NWA. They enveloped traffic on Constitution Avenue. Every car honked in solidarity. Marco Silva, 28, was driving a “College Hunks” moving service truck when he was swarmed. But he was not bothered. Hopping out to light a cigarette and pump his fist in the air, he said: “I think this is beautiful. What everybody is doing right now is a beautiful thing.”
A significant portion of the demonstrators were white, and they joined with the largely African-American crowd to protest police aggression. Cameron McCall, 23, a self-described social media influencer, helped organize the protest, with an emphasis on peace, and said: “We’ve seen that we have a strong voice on social media with our generation, and look at us now, united, walking, and off our phones. Beyond shoes and clothes and celebrities, we are doing it for a purpose.”
As the day progressed, marchers knelt near the National Museum of African American History and Culture for nine minutes of silence, around the time that Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck in Minneapolis. As they moved on past the World War II Memorial, they urged tourists to join them. The sun began to dip as they rested at the Lincoln Memorial.
President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House on Saturday evening after a day at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, had suggested in a tweet that Saturday would be “MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE” and that his supporters might turn out in their red “Make America Great Again” caps. But there were no red caps to be seen among a sea of hundreds flooding H Street.
By 9 p.m., tensions between police and a growing crowd of protesters broke out, with demonstrators wresting the barricades from police, who in turn volleyed canisters of tear gas into the crowd.
“Water with baking soda helps,” said Azzah Davis, 19, who was kneeling in a nearby alley trying to recover from the gas. “We were protesting, I don’t want to say peacefully, because things were getting out of control, and the cops were shooting people with rubber bullets. They started throwing mace and people picked it up and threw it back.” She added: “It’s very long overdue. We have been peaceful long enough.”
A flaming dumpster illuminated police as some demonstrators hurled bricks and other projectiles their way. Despite the pandemic, many people in the crowd had no choice but to discard their masks to cough and sneeze as the acrid tang of tear gas whipped up and down the block.
Sarah Cooper, a 27-year-old accountant, was holding a sign that mentioned COVID-19. “It’s a systemic issue. Black people are more likely to die from COVID-19,” she said. After three hours in front of the White House, she added, “it’s kind of disorganized, but I think it’s nice that people are still coming out to push for change.”
By 11 p.m., a Chevy Suburban on I Street was in flames and the crowds fanned out, smashing windows and trying to wreck as much as they could.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Two lawyers were charged with taking part in a Molotov cocktail attack on a police patrol car over the weekend — a human rights lawyer and a Princeton-educated associate at a Manhattan law firm.
The attack during the Brooklyn protests left the dashboard of a blue-and-white police car charred after a night of violent clashes between protesters and police, a symbol of the chaos wrought over a weekend of sometimes peaceful and sometimes violent demonstrations.
The car was unoccupied when the Molotov cocktail ignited, and no one was injured, the authorities said.
The two lawyers involved in the attack were identified by federal authorities as Urooj Rahman, 31, the human rights lawyer, and Colinford King Mattis, 32, an associate at the midsize law firm of Pryor Cashman LLP, who graduated from Princeton.
Both were arrested shortly after the incident early Saturday during protests against the killing of George Floyd, federal authorities said.
Mattis and Rahman were charged with causing damage to a police vehicle by fire and explosives, according to a criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.
The Brooklyn prosecutors on Saturday also charged a 27-year-old woman from Catskill, New York, in a separate Molotov cocktail attack against another police vehicle, about 10 minutes later and a mile and a half away.
Mattis and Rahman were expected to appear Monday before a federal magistrate in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, and it could not be determined if they have lawyers representing them yet. A relative of Mattis who declined to be identified said, “He’s not a bad person and his family supports him.”
Police video surveillance near the 88th Precinct station house in the Fort Greene neighborhood captured the attack, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case.
It showed Rahman climbing out of a tan 2015 Chrysler Town and Country minivan driven by Mattis and moving toward the patrol car, the complaint said.
As she neared, she lit a fuse hanging out of a Bud Light beer bottle and threw it through an already broken window of the police vehicle, igniting its console. The complaint said she returned to the minivan and the pair fled.
The police saw Rahman throw the Molotov cocktail and followed the two lawyers as they tried to get away, officials said. A patrol car stopped them several blocks away and they were arrested.
Inside the car, officers saw in plain view materials for making more Molotov cocktails — a bottle filled with toilet paper and what was believed to be gasoline inside and a lighter, the complaint said.
Mattis began working in July 2018 as an associate in the corporate group at Pryor Cashman, where, according to his profile on the firm’s website, he advises public and private companies, their executives and boards on mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, financing and corporate governance, among other matters.
He also served on the community board in East New York, the Brooklyn neighborhood where he lives.
Pryor Cashman, in a statement from Managing Partner Ronald H. Shechtman, said Mattis had been furloughed from the firm in April and that his status would be reviewed by the firm this week.
“As we confront critical issues around historic and ongoing racism and inequity in our society, I am saddened to see this young man allegedly involved in the worst kind of reaction to our shared outrage over what had occurred,” the statement said.
The picture on his LinkedIn profile shows a smiling young man in a business suit, white shirt and striped red tie, and the profile says he graduated from Princeton University in 2010 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and earned a law degree from New York University Law School in 2016.
Rahman, a graduate of Fordham Law School, works as a human rights lawyer, according to a Facebook post about an April 30 talk she was scheduled to give to a Muslim group, where she was to discuss “Love of the Earth.”
The criminal complaint charging the lawyers, filed late Saturday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, was sworn out by an FBI agent assigned to the Joint Terrorist Task Force.
In the second attack, in Crown Heights, Samantha Shader threw a Molotov cocktail at a marked police van near Eastern Parkway and Washington Avenue, federal authorities charged.
Four officers were sitting inside but managed to scramble out, according to the criminal complaint in that case, and were not injured. The fuse had been lit, but the gasoline did not ignite.
Shader, like the two lawyers, was charged with causing damage to a police vehicle by fire and explosives, according to the criminal complaint in her case. She was arrested shortly after the attack, the complaint said. Her sister, Darian Shader, 21, was also taken into custody after attempting to interfere with her arrest, the police said.
Relatives and friends of the Shader sisters could not be reached for comment.
In 2017, a local newspaper based in Kingston, New York, reported Samantha Shader, then 24, and an unidentified 18-year-old woman, both of Catskill, were arrested by state police in Ulster County. Shader was charged with assault and menacing with a weapon, the local paper reported. She was released with a desk appearance ticket.

‘Please, I Don’t Have Insurance’: Businesses Plead With Protesters [With graphic(s)]

In downtown Chicago, people crawled through the partially shattered exterior window of a Nike store and ran out carrying brightly colored athletic gear and sneakers.
On Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, they ignited garbage cans and broke locks on luxury stores, sweeping up armfuls of designer handbags and jeans.
And as night fell on Minneapolis, the heart of widening protests set off by the death of an African American man in police custody there, business owners stood outside their doors and pleaded with agitators to spare the enterprises that many said they had spent their life savings to build.
“I was outside saying, ‘Please, I don’t have insurance!’” said Hussein Aloshani, an immigrant from Iraq, waving his arms in frustration as he recounted the scene Friday night outside the deli his family owns.
Businesses across the country suffered destruction over the weekend as protesters unleashed their anger over the death of George Floyd on commercial enterprises — from the offices of major multinational corporations and banks to family-owned restaurants and bars.
In some places, demonstrators scrawled graffiti on storefronts decrying police brutality against African Americans or echoing some of Floyd’s final words: “I can’t breathe.”
In others, they hurled crowbars and hammers at windows and used gasoline to burn buildings to the ground.
Public officials said they were investigating whether political agitators posing as protesters may have led some of the looting. In some cities, peaceful protesters marching against police violence were outnumbered by others, such as white anarchists, who seemed more bent on destruction than messaging.
Regardless of who the perpetrators were, many store owners said they felt like the victims of misplaced aggression. They said their businesses, already ailing from an outbreak of the coronavirus that has been particularly devastating to small and minority-owned businesses, may not recover.
“A lot of people don’t know the blood, sweat and tears that go into being a business owner and the type of sacrifices we had to go through to be where we’re at right now,” said Kris Shelby, who woke around 1 a.m. Saturday to the sound of gunfire outside his north Atlanta apartment, which overlooks the luxury clothing store he manages.
Shelby and his business partner opened Attom in 2016 with the goal of bringing luxury brands more widely available in New York and Los Angeles to their city. They have drawn in celebrity clients such as musicians Migos and Justin Bieber and supplied clothing for the movie “Black Panther.” The store has also been a welcoming space for a diverse group of Atlanta residents, Shelby said.
But when he returned to the store at around 5 a.m. Saturday, Shelby found that all of his merchandise was gone. He watched videos posted on social media of masked young people of all races swarming through the smashed front windows and leaving with pieces of clothing and accessories worth hundreds of dollars each.
Shelby said he shared the pain of people protesting Floyd’s death but did not believe that stealing would stop such incidents from happening in the future.
“It hurt. It seriously hurt,” Shelby said of Floyd’s death. “But as a black man, and this is a black-owned business, it’s just sad. It really leaves a bad taste in our mouths, to be honest.”
Ricardo Hernandez spent the weekend sleeping in a van outside the Mexican ice cream shop he runs with his wife in south Minneapolis. He negotiated with protesters by handing over ice cream and Popsicles so they would leave the shop intact.
“Just looking at this is terrible,” he said of the rubble and broken glass strewed across the neighborhood. “It’s unreal.”
On Saturday afternoon, Latino business owners in Minneapolis met in a parking lot to prepare for another night of unrest. Most owned commercial enterprises on Lake Street, where dozens of buildings had been vandalized the previous two nights.
They established shifts to ensure that the neighborhood would be monitored throughout the night. Organizers advised proprietors against brandishing weapons and said they planned to order T-shirts with the logo “Lake Street Latino Security” to avoid being confused for looters by National Guard troops and police officers responding to the unrest.
Maya Santamaria was at the gathering but said she planned to stay home that night because she had nothing left to protect. The building she previously owned — where she had once employed Floyd as a nightclub security guard and where her new business venture, a Spanish language radio station, was also housed — had burned down Friday night.
Santamaria blamed police for Floyd’s death and said they had not done enough to protect businesses in the aftermath.
“We were calling 911 and we were calling the Police Department, and there was no response,” she said. She did not want officers to resort to violence against protesters, she said, but “they can’t just not come and leave us to burn, either.”
Kester Wubben’s new mail and printing business in Minneapolis had just been getting off the ground when the pandemic hit. Then over the weekend, it was looted. Televisions, an iPad and a U-Haul truck were stolen.
He had sacrificed greatly — pulling money out of his retirement savings account and working overnight shifts seven days a week at a lead factory — in order to start his Mailboxes Plus outlet.
In less than a year of business, he had developed regular customers. Miss Diggins stopped at the store a few times a month to ship packages to her daughter at college, and the pastor from Wubben’s church strolled in with a smile almost daily to check his mailbox and catch up.
Wubben, who is black, said he grew up five blocks from the site where Floyd was detained. He let out a weary sigh when asked whether his business would be able to recover from the damage, responding, “We might just have to let it go and try again another time.”
At the same time, he said, he understood the frustration over what had happened to Floyd. “That could easily be me. And so that’s how I look at it. That could easily be me. And it’s sad that there’s no humanity.”
He said he thought about the loss he had faced as a business owner compared with the loss of the Floyd family. “So, when you equate the life to the money, which one is greater?” he said. “I can make some money again, I can start another business, but you can’t start George Floyd’s life back over. It’s ended.”
The protests in Seattle were an opportunity for Jordan Davis-Miller to demand a better future for black Americans. But it disturbed him to watch some of the thousands of people gathered downtown seize a different opportunity: to smash windows and loot retail stores. Many of them, he pointed out, were white.
“Looting Nordstrom’s and small stores is not going to do anything for us,” Davis-Miller said as he watched two white people inside the flagship Nordstrom store throw items out a shattered window. “It’s going to cause more flame to the fire, and it’s going to give black people and people of color bad names. It’s not what we are here for.”
At the same time, Davis-Miller said, “It makes sense to be angry. It makes sense to want to destroy things and take things, because that’s all that’s ever been happening with any people of color. Our land, our homes, our livelihoods have been taken from us. It makes complete sense that we’d want to take that all back.”
Some business owners said they have tried to signal support for the protest movement in the hope that it would also help protect their establishments.
Derrick Hayes put up signs Friday night in the windows of his restaurant in downtown Atlanta that identified Big Dave’s Cheesesteaks as a black-owned business.
Hayes opened the restaurant after his father died, naming it in his memory. His “Dave’s Way” cheesesteaks and beef egg rolls often draw lines down the block and are favorites of black and white Atlanta residents alike.
He came in Saturday morning to find that the windows had been smashed, despite the signs he had displayed.
“Honestly, I was in disbelief,” Hayes said. “If we’re all in this together, let’s show that we’re all in this together.”

Protesters who took to the streets in Minneapolis for the fifth straight night Saturday met a more determined response from police officers and National Guard troops, as demonstrations escalated in dozens of cities across the country — an outpouring of national anger sparked by the death of a black man in police custody.
Soon after an 8 p.m. curfew took effect, the police in Minneapolis began arresting protesters and firing tear gas and other projectiles toward crowds, and the National Guard used a helicopter to dump water on a burning car.
The forceful response reflected the desire of authorities to halt the violent protests that have spread nationwide since George Floyd, 46, died after being pinned down by a white Minneapolis police officer. There were still reports of violence and destruction: a fire on the roof of a shopping mall, a person who shot a gun at officers, and a group of people throwing items at the police. But state officials said around 11 p.m. local time that they were encouraged by the smaller crowds and apparent decrease in damage. Much of the city was empty shortly after midnight.
But even as aerial videos from Minneapolis showed police officers largely keeping demonstrators at bay, other cities were being overwhelmed, despite hastily imposed curfews.
Mayors ordered people of the streets in many of the nation’s largest cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Miami. And governors in at least eight states, including Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Colorado and Tennessee, called up National Guard troops in an attempt to impose order, often with little success.
In Tennessee, the building that houses Nashville’s City Hall was set on fire. Two police vans in New York City were filmed plowing into protesters. In Washington, demonstrators set fires and smashed the windows of buildings near the White House. The police in Indianapolis said three people had been shot during the protests — not by police officers — including one person who was killed. And in Philadelphia, the Police Department said at least 13 officers had been injured during protests.
The demonstrations continued to escalate Friday and Saturday even after Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was recorded kneeling on Floyd’s neck until he lost consciousness, was charged with third-degree murder.
President Donald Trump has harshly criticized the unrest, and Attorney General William Barr warned on Saturday that people inflicting the destruction could face federal charges. Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said the people defying curfews and confronting the police were no longer protesting brutality but rather were seeking to exploit Floyd’s death for their own political motives.
Protests escalated nationwide throughout Saturday, prompting many cities to impose curfews.
Tens of thousands of people were in the streets across the United States on Saturday night, as demonstrations stretched from coast to coast in a national paroxysm of rage that saw buildings set on fire, businesses looted and an aggressive response from the authorities.
Protests have taken place in at least 48 cities and have reached the gates of the White House in the days since Floyd’s death. The imposition of curfews by mayors appeared to be more widespread on Saturday than at any time since the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.
— In Indianapolis, one person was killed and three others were injured when a gunman fired shots at a protest, the police said.
— In Chicago, protesters scuffled with police Saturday afternoon, burning at least one flag and marching toward the Trump International Hotel and Tower before dispersing. About 3,000 people took part in the protests, according to local news reports. Some protesters vandalized police vehicles and left spray-painted buildings in their wake.
— In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti issued a curfew, a day after the police made more than 500 arrests. Police used batons and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, and Gov. Gavin Newsom activated the National Guard.
— In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed implemented a curfew as demonstrators arrived outside her home to protest.
— In Miami-Dade County, Florida, Mayor Carlos Gimenez ordered a countywide curfew beginning at 11 p.m. after at least one police car was set ablaze near the Miami Police Department headquarters. Tear gas was used to disperse crowds Saturday evening in Jacksonville and Orlando.
— In Washington, the National Guard was deployed outside the White House, where chanting crowds clashed with the Secret Service and attacked a Fox News reporter. Fires were set in Lafayette Park, just steps from the White House.
— In Philadelphia, at least 13 police officers were injured when protesters began setting fires and became violent.
— In New York City, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets for a third day, gathering at marches in Harlem, Brooklyn, Queens and outside Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. In the late afternoon, protesters in Brooklyn confronted the police in a series of street melees, hurling empty bottles and pieces of debris at officers who responded with billy clubs and pepper spray. A video showed a police car driving into a crowd.
— In Richmond, Virginia, two police officers at the state Capitol were hospitalized with leg injuries after being struck by a baseball bat and a beer bottle, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Earlier, the police fired tear gas at protesters, some of whom launched fireworks and smashed windows.
Police and protesters clashed as flames rose on the streets outside the White House.
The turmoil was on display a short distance from the White House, where Trump had called earlier in the day for his supporters to rally. Instead, hundreds of protesters mobilized on the streets of the nation’s capital as tensions ratcheted higher.
Demonstrators hurled projectiles, including water bottles, fireworks and bricks, and wrested barricades from the police, who responded by lobbing canisters of tear gas into the crowd. Buildings up and down the streets near the White House were sprayed with graffiti, including the entrance of the Hay-Adams, a luxury hotel.
Nearby, scaffolding on a construction site behind the U.S. Chamber of Commerce could be seen on fire. The windows at the entrance of the building were smashed.
Around 11 p.m., two cars were set ablaze on an adjacent block, and a local bank was vandalized, its windows broken and the numbers “666” sprayed across the front.
As police officers moved to secure the block, a Chevy Suburban was engulfed in a plume of black smoke; trees nearby were on fire. The crowds retreated into Farragut Square to regroup as helicopters circled overhead, and some split off back toward the White House.
Trump had made a series of statements throughout the day that did little to tamp down the outrage nationwide. Speaking on the South Lawn of the White House, he criticized the authorities in Minnesota for allowing protests to turn violent and offered the help of the military to contain further demonstrations.
In a series of tweets, he called demonstrators who gathered at the White House on Friday night “professionally managed so-called ‘protesters’” and suggested that his supporters would meet them. “Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???”
Later Saturday, speaking from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after observing the launch of a manned SpaceX rocket, Trump blamed the unrest in cities across the country on “Antifa and other radical left-wing groups,” drawing a distinction between “peaceful protesters” and other, more violent demonstrators.
“What we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace,” Trump said. “The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists.”
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, released a statement early Sunday appealing for calm.
“We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,” he wrote. “We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.”
Minnesota’s governor activated all National Guard troops but declined the Army’s offer to deploy military police.
Walz of Minnesota activated thousands of additional National Guard troops to send to Minneapolis but declined the Army’s offer to deploy military police units.
Walz, a Democrat, acknowledged that officials had underestimated the demonstrations in Minneapolis, where despite a newly issued curfew, people burned buildings and turned the city’s streets into a smoldering battleground Friday night. He compared the havoc to wars that Americans have fought overseas and said he expected even more unrest Saturday night.
“What you’ve seen in previous nights, I think, will be dwarfed by what they will do tonight,” he said.
Pentagon officials said that Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Friday with Walz to express “willingness” to deploy military police units.
Nonetheless, the U.S. Northern Command has put several military police units on four-hour status, which means they could be ready to deploy in four hours, as opposed to a day.
Commissioner John Harrington of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that there had been “tens of thousands” of people in the streets Friday, more than any other night since Floyd’s death Monday.
Mayor Jacob Frey, looking weary after four days of outrage in his city, pleaded with residents to go home and stop burning down the local businesses that he said were even more vital in the middle of a pandemic.
“You’re not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town,” Frey said. “You’re not getting back at anybody.”
Death toll since Wednesday rises to four.
One person was killed and three others were injured when a gunman fired shots at a protest in Indianapolis early Sunday, bringing to at least four the total number of people killed since Wednesday in violence possibly connected with the outcry.
The authorities were also investigating a possible connection with the shooting death of a federal officer in California.
The officer, a contract security guard for the Department of Homeland Security, was shot and killed outside a federal courthouse in Oakland on Friday night as demonstrations in the city turned violent, with protesters setting fires, destroying property and clashing with the police.
Ken Cuccinelli, the Department of Homeland Security’s acting deputy secretary, called the attack an act of “domestic terrorism,” but the state’s governor cautioned against connecting the shooting with the protests.
“No one should rush to conflate this heinous act with the protests last night,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, in a statement.
Elsewhere, people were killed when once-peaceful protests descended into violence.
The authorities in Minneapolis on Friday identified a man whose killing Wednesday was the first to be directly connected to the protests and looting there.
The victim, Calvin Horton Jr., 43, was shot to death outside a pawnshop that was being looted.
Also on Friday in Detroit, a 21-year-old man was shot to death while sitting in his car near Cadillac Square, as hundreds of protesters swarmed the streets. The police said the gunman may have known and targeted the victim and used the chaos of the demonstrations as a cover.
Officials blame outsiders for stoking violence but have little evidence.
Officials in Minnesota and Washington are claiming that outside groups are undermining the protests in Minneapolis, using them as a cover to set fires, loot stores and destroy property. But they disagree on whether far-left or far-right groups are to blame and have not offered evidence to substantiate their claims.
On Saturday, Walz said the “best estimate” suggested that 80% of those arrested at the protests were not from the state. “I’m not trying to deflect in any way. I’m not trying to say there aren’t Minnesotans amongst this group,” Walz said. But “the vast majority,” he said, are from outside the state.
KARE, a Minneapolis television station, found that such claims may not be accurate. The station reviewed all of the arrests made by Minneapolis-based police agencies for rioting, unlawful assembly and burglary-related crimes from Friday to Saturday and found that 86% of those arrested listed a Minnesota address.
The mayor of St. Paul, Melvin Carter, on Saturday retracted his claim that “every single person” arrested Friday night was from out of state. A spokesman said the mayor later learned that “more than half” are from Minnesota.
Harrington said the authorities were analyzing those arrested, trying to understand what online platforms they have used and whom they were associated with.
“We have seen things like white supremacist organizers who have posted things on platforms about coming to Minnesota,” Harrington said. “Is this organized crime? Is this an organized cell of terror? Where is the linkage?”
Frey also blamed outsiders for the violence. “We are now confronting white supremacists, members of organized crime, out of state instigators and possibly even foreign actors to destroy and destabilize our city and our region,” he wrote on Twitter.
On Saturday, Trump insisted that the protesters were far-left extremists. “The memory of George Floyd is now being exploited by rioters, looters and anarchists,” he said.
Attorney General William Barr echoed the claim.
“In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups, far-left extremist groups, using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from outside the state to promote the violence,” he said.
Residents say that Minneapolis has a core group of white anarchists. A man known as the Umbrella Man, dressed in all black and carrying a black umbrella, who appears to be white, was filmed breaking windows at an AutoZone store.
Tension rose at protests in Los Angeles, where memories of Rodney King are still raw.
The protest on Los Angeles’ affluent West Side began peacefully Saturday and stayed that way for nearly three hours. Activists handed out water and food, and a crowd marched on Beverly Boulevard, chanting slogans against police brutality and waving placards.
And then it took a violent turn.
Suddenly a police car was smashed and set on fire, black smoke billowing into the blue sky. A young man threw a skateboard at a police officer, and frightened men and women rushed away in every direction. Police helicopters hovered overhead, and convoys of police SUVs raced to the scene.
As tensions rose on the fourth day of protests, the mayor declared an 8 p.m. curfew.
“Go home,” Garcetti said. “Let us put the fires out. Let us learn the lessons. Let us re-humanize each other.”
But later in the evening, looting was reported at a Nordstrom store at The Grove, an upscale mall near the area of the protest, and a small fire was burning outside.
In San Francisco, a march drew about 1,000 people but remained peaceful, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. In Oakland, Mayor Libby Schaaf called on demonstrators to stay home after violent demonstrations Friday.
In Sacramento, police officers surrounded the state Capitol as protesters pelted them and their horses with oranges and water bottles.
Before the mayhem started in Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon, several hundred people reflecting the diversity of the city — white, black, Latino, Asian American — had protested peacefully.
The death of Floyd and the unrest it has provoked has tugged at painful memories in Los Angeles of the Rodney King beating in 1991 and the riots that occurred the next year after the acquittal of the four police officers involved in the case.
Reporters find themselves the targets of violence from protesters and the police.
A freelance photographer who was shot in the eye while covering the protests in Minneapolis on Saturday was one of several journalists who have been attacked, arrested or otherwise harassed while covering the protests that have erupted nationwide.
With trust in the news media lagging, journalists have found themselves the target of ire on both sides of a deeply politicized crisis.
A television reporter in Louisville, Kentucky was hit by a pepper ball on live television by an officer who appeared to be aiming at her.
Outside the White House, protesters attacked Leland Vittert, a Fox News correspondent and his crew, taking the journalist’s microphone and striking him with it.
In Atlanta, masses of protesters Friday night converged on CNN headquarters, where they broke through the front door, lobbed fireworks and vandalized the building. Earlier in the day, Omar Jimenez, a reporter for the network, was detained as he reported on live television.
“I was aiming my next shot, put my camera down for a second, and then my face exploded,” said Linda Tirado, the photojournalist. “I immediately felt blood and was screaming, ‘I’m press! I’m press!’”
The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press logged about 10 different incidents that ranged from assaults to menacing in Phoenix, Indianapolis, Atlanta and Minneapolis.
“With the unraveling of civil peace around the country, reporters are perceived as a target by both the police and the protesters,” said Bruce Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee, “and that is an extremely frightening place to be.”
An anguished nation watched the unrest with a mix of hope and horror.
The mass demonstrations, some peaceful, some destructive, touched off an anguished debate Saturday among commentators, pastors and scholars about the role of protest in forcing political and social change in America.
In the pages of the nation’s newspapers and on social media, some watched in horror and others with a sense of hope as protesters took to the streets following Floyd’s death.
Singer Selena Gomez said she had spent the last 24 hours “trying to process this all.”
“Nothing anyone says can take back what has happened,” she wrote on Twitter. “But we can and must all make sure to take action. Too many black lives have been taken from us for far too long.”
Shana Redmond, a scholar of music, race and politics at UCLA’s Herb Alpert School of Music, described receiving calls from loved ones in Minneapolis with “tears running too fast to pause at sadness.”
“They are hot with rage and anger at the condition of Black people in that place and in this world,” she wrote on Twitter. “This is not a drill. This is our terrifying, murderous present. #MinneapolisRebellion.”
Some who sympathized with the protesters voiced concern that the destruction could undermine the goal of forcing social change.
“I understand our frustration, rage and anger but it’s of no benefit when we hurt ourselves in the process,” Jamal Bryant, the pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia, wrote on Twitter. “I urge adamantly for the fixing of this corrupt justice system, and I pray profusely for the black businesses adversely affected!”
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is the only black Republican in the Senate and has called for the arrest of all four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest, urged calm.
“I know well the anger and frustration felt throughout communities of color right now,” he wrote on Twitter. “But violence is not the answer. Violence takes the focus off #GeorgeFloyd and the real issues at hand, and gives those who prey on division more fuel. Make your voices heard, not bricks and fire.”
Brian Merchant, an author, noted how the nation was briefly distracted Saturday by the launch of a rocket built and operated not by NASA but SpaceX, the company founded by billionaire Elon Musk.
“The symbolism of a billionaire-owned, for-profit space company launching astronauts high above the heads of thousands of people protesting state brutality and oppression amid a global pandemic and economic collapse should not be lost on anyone,” he wrote.
On Blavity, a website geared toward black millennials, an editorial argued that the fires in Minneapolis reflected “the rage of Black protestors fed up seeing the lives of our brothers and sisters robbed by racism.”
“We are fed up because we are forced to fight a pandemic amid a pandemic,” the editorial said. “We are being disproportionately killed by systemic and overt racism at the same time — and are expected to accept these deadly conditions.”
In the Los Angeles Times, an editorial argued that the country should focus should not on the looting but on the repeated instances of the police killing black men.
“And no, police violence does not justify the rampages that erupted in Minneapolis,” the editorial said. “But as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. pointed out more than a half-century ago, ‘a riot is the language of the unheard.’”
The officer who pinned Floyd was charged with murder, and his wife is seeking a divorce.
The intensifying protests came after the authorities announced that the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground had been arrested and charged with murder Friday, a development that activists and Floyd’s family had called for but also said did not go far enough.
Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, charges that come with a combined maximum sentence of 35 years.
An investigation into the three other officers who were present at the scene remains ongoing.
Floyd’s relatives have said that had wanted the more serious charge of first-degree murder.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.” Charges of first- and second-degree murder require prosecutors to prove, in almost all cases, that the perpetrator made a decision to kill the victim.
A lawyer for Chauvin’s wife, Kellie, said that she was devastated by Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for his family and those grieving his loss. The case has also led her Chauvin to seek a divorce, the lawyer, Amanda Mason-Sekula, said in an interview Friday night.

Across Country, Officials Brace For a Fifth Night of Unrest [With graphic(s)]

Demonstrators returned to the nation’s streets in sweeping fashion on Saturday, amassing outside City Hall in San Francisco, shutting down highway traffic in Miami and attempting to topple a statue in Philadelphia, in a showing of national anger and sorrow over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died Monday in the custody of the Minneapolis police.
But officials feared that the most dangerous standoffs were yet to come in Minneapolis on Saturday night, where officials were bracing for a fifth night of unrest.
The demonstrations have spread to at least three dozen cities across the country in the days since Floyd, 46, died after being pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd pleaded, “I can’t breathe.” The protests continued to surge after the former officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder on Friday, reflecting long-simmering anger over racism and police brutality that extend far beyond a single case.
“I’m fed up,” Jarrell Slade, a 26-year-old school counselor, said at a protest in Washington, where hundreds gathered outside the Justice Department and marched down the National Mall on Saturday afternoon. “I’m tired of going on social media, talking to my friends and family, and having everything be centered on black death.”
President Donald Trump on Saturday urged officials in Minnesota to “get tougher” on the protesters and offered greater military support, a move that would represent a significant escalation in the government’s response to the tensions. Gov. Tim Walz declined the Army’s offer to deploy military police units, but said he had activated all 13,000 of the state’s National Guard troops and warned that Saturday night’s protest could be the largest and most destructive yet.
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis urged protesters to stay off the streets Saturday night. “We need you to stay home tonight to be able to respond to those who are trying to loot and burn our city,” he wrote on Twitter.
The massive crowds represented a sudden departure for cities that had previously been under lockdown orders amid the coronavirus pandemic, and officials quickly found themselves shifting from one crisis to another. In Louisville, Kentucky, where protests have centered on the death of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was shot dead by white police officers who entered her home in March, Mayor Greg Fischer imposed a curfew and called in the National Guard. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti also issued a curfew, a day after the police made more than 500 arrests.
In New York City, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets for a third day, gathering at marches in Harlem, Brooklyn, Queens and outside Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. In the late afternoon, protesters in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn confronted the police in a series of street melees, hurling empty bottles and pieces of debris at officers who responded with billy clubs and pepper spray.
Many of the hundreds marching through Center City in Philadelphia on Saturday were doing so peacefully, with fists raised and signs held aloft in anger over Floyd’s death. But there were reports of destruction as the afternoon wore on.
At least one police car caught on fire, and a large group of protesters had spray-painted a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo and were trying to topple it. Rizzo, a former police commissioner who died in 1991, cultivated a law-and-order image that included raiding gay clubs and once forcing Black Panthers to strip naked in the street. He remains a figure loathed by many for his harsh tactics. The current mayor, Jim Kenney, had announced plans to move the statue to a new location.
In Tallahassee, Florida, the driver of a red pickup truck struck a crowd of protesters, in a fleeting but terrifying episode that officials said did not end in serious injury. The protest there came days after the Tallahassee police fatally shot Tony McDade, a black transgender person whom the police had identified as a suspect in a stabbing.
In Minneapolis, about 300 to 400 protesters gathered outside the home of the Hennepin County Attorney, Mike Freeman, holding signs and listening to speakers, including the mothers of children killed by the police, according to a neighbor, Clare Padgett. It was the fourth day of protests outside the home of the prosecutor, who charged the police officer who pinned Floyd but has not pressed charges against other officers who were on the scene.
Minnesota’s governor activated all National Guard troops but declined the Army’s offer to deploy military police.
Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota activated thousands of additional National Guard troops to send to Minneapolis but declined the Army’s offer to deploy military police units, as days of protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody, threatened to boil over even further on Saturday.
Walz, a Democrat, acknowledged that officials had underestimated the demonstrations in Minneapolis, where despite a newly issued curfew, people burned buildings and turned the city’s streets into a smoldering battleground on Friday night. He compared the havoc to wars that Americans have fought overseas, and said he expected even more unrest on Saturday night.
“What you’ve seen in previous nights, I think, will be dwarfed by what they will do tonight,” he said.
Pentagon officials said that Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Friday with Walz, to express “willingness” to deploy military police units. The governor declined the offer, the officials said, and has since activated all of the state’s national guard troops, up to 13,200.
Nonetheless, the U.S. Northern Command has put several military police units on four-hour status, which means they could be ready to deploy in four hours, as opposed to a day.
Commissioner John Harrington of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that there had been “tens of thousands” of people in the streets on Friday, more than any other night since Floyd’s death on Monday set off a wave of protests that have become increasingly destructive across the country.
Frey, looking weary after four days of outrage in his city, pleaded with residents to go home and stop burning down the local businesses that he said were even more vital in the middle of a pandemic.
“You’re not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town,” Frey said. “You’re not getting back at anybody.”
Trump blames ‘left-wing groups’ for the violence, and Barr threatens rioters with prosecution.
Trump on Saturday blamed the unrest in cities across the country on “Antifa and other radical left-wing groups,” drawing a distinction between “peaceful protesters” and other, more violent demonstrators.
“I understand the pain that people are feeling,” Trump said, speaking from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after observing the launch of a manned SpaceX rocket. “We support the right of peaceful protesters, and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace. The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists.”
While he called Floyd’s death “a grave tragedy,” Trump also said that residents affected by violent protests were the “main victims of this horrible, horrible situation.”
Speaking on the South Lawn of the White House earlier in the day, Trump criticized the authorities in Minnesota for allowing protests to turn violent and offered the help of the military to contain further demonstrations.
“They have to get tougher, and by being tougher they will be honoring his memory,” the president said, adding, “When I saw the policemen running out of a police station for that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life.”
His comments, paired with a series of tweets on Saturday, threatened to inflame an already tense situation that has played out in protests across the country and in front of the White House.
In one tweet, he called demonstrators who gathered at the White House on Friday night “professionally managed so-called ‘protesters’” and suggested that his supporters would march outside the White House on Saturday.
“Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” he tweeted.
Asked later whether the tweet might have invited more violence, Trump demurred. “These are people that love our country,” he said of his supporters. “I have no idea if they were going to be here, I was just asking.”
“By the way,” he added, “they love African-American people, they love black people.”
Attorney General William Barr, who has vowed a swift federal investigation into Floyd’s death, also weighed in Saturday, issuing a stern warning to left-wing “agitators” who he said were exploiting the protests to pursue their own goals.
Barr, at a brief news conference, warned that protesters who cross state lines to “incite or participate in violent rioting” may be violating federal laws and that the Justice Department would pursue cases against them.
The U.S. attorney in Minnesota is investigating the actions of the police officer who pinned Floyd to the ground for possible violations of civil rights laws or other federal crimes.
In Atlanta, protesters and curiosity-seekers visited CNN headquarters to see the damage.
After hundreds of demonstrators poured into the streets of Atlanta on Friday night, smashing windows, vandalizing a large CNN sign and clashing with police officers, a more muted crowd arrived at the scene on Saturday — some out of curiosity, and some to continue protesting.
Bianca Billups, 31, stood holding a sign for the cars passing by to see: “White Supremacy Did This.” She had been there for hours, she said, and she had also been at the protests on Friday evening.
“They think people are out here causing havoc because they can,” she said. “People drive by here and they’ll see this and think, ‘Those people are so reckless.’ No, those people are scared and they’re in survivor mode. They’re done. They’re fed up.”
Ty Harris, 41, walked up with a hat and scarf covering his face; both said, “Make America United For Once.” “I think this is the spark that’s going to change life as we know,” he said.
On the edge of Centennial Olympic Park, a series of people came up to speak into a shared microphone. “They want you to fear,” said one man who added that he had been stopped by the police some 20 times because, he said, he looked “suspicious.”
Some of the buildings near the CNN Center, the epicenter of the Friday protests, had smashed windows and were protected by fencing.
Joscie Beachum, a 27-year-old Atlanta resident looking at the damaged CNN Center, said, “I just don’t know what good this did.”
“I felt sad they felt the need to tear apart a historic place in Atlanta, but I also think we’re better than that,” she added. But, she said, “They felt this was the only way they could get their point across, and that’s sad.”
The officer who pinned Floyd was charged with murder, and his w ife is seeking a divorce.
The intensifying protests came after authorities announced that the officer who pinned George Floyd to the ground had been arrested and charged with murder on Friday, a development that activists and Floyd’s family had called for but also said did not go far enough.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, charges that come with a combined maximum sentence of 35 years.
An investigation into the three other officers who were present at the scene remains ongoing.
Floyd’s relatives have said that had wanted the more serious charge of first-degree murder.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.” Charges of first- and second-degree murder require prosecutors to prove, in almost all cases, that the perpetrator made a decision to kill the victim.
A lawyer for Chauvin’s wife, Kellie, said that she was devastated by Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for his family and those grieving his loss. The case has also led Kellie Chauvin to seek a divorce, the lawyer, Amanda Mason-Sekula, said in an interview on Friday night.

Tracee Ellis Ross can’t dance — at least, not the kind of dancing that requires following choreography in three-inch heels while belting disco-pop into a microphone. She learned this the hard way, preparing for “The High Note,” a new comedy out Friday on video on demand. She plays Grace Davis, a superstar singer looking for a refresh; enter her striving personal assistant (Dakota Johnson) who dreams of being a producer.
“I’ve never been more overwhelmed in my life,” Ross said of the dance numbers. She kept asking the choreographers to take it down a notch. “I was like, ‘We’ve been working on this one little move for quite some time now. Should we perhaps vary it and come up with a different move that my body seems to want to bend in the shape of? Because what I’m doing does not look like what you’re doing.’”
In Ross’s vision, Grace is the kind of over-the-top glamster who changes her nail color for every outfit, feels most at home onstage in a feathery jumpsuit, and demands that her assistant break in her shoes — but has also overcome numerous hurdles as a female artist of color. Ross loved the part, she said, because for iconic artists, “it’s extremely hard work to make it look as effortless as it seems, and we forget that they have fears and dreams and secrets and hurts and hearts, and all of those things.”
“I feel like Grace Davis was written with all of that already intertwined there,” she said.
Ross knows what you’re thinking: Yes, Grace does bear a resemblance to her own mother, Diana Ross. And no, that didn’t weigh on her. She hardly thought about it herself, she said, except to ask the movie’s hairstylist not to make her ’do too much like her mom’s.
More nerve-racking for Ross was that she was due to make her big-screen singing debut in the film. She worked with a voice coach, studied clips of performers — just how do they wield that mic? — and still felt shaken when it came time to film a big concert scene. “This is not for the faint of heart,” she thought. “You have to put aside your own insecurities and shame and judgment, and just go for it.”
It was, she added, “so worth it.”
It’s the first leading movie role for Ross, 47, who spent eight years starring on the series “Girlfriends” before finding even greater acclaim on “black-ish,” the ABC family comedy. She’s now a producer on one of its spinoffs, “mixed-ish,” a prequel for her character (who is based, as an adult, on the wife of Kenya Barris, who created “black-ish”). Ross is the rare star whose clout has grown and diversified as she’s matured — she gave a TED Talk in 2018 and started a hair care company, specializing in curls, in 2019.
“‘Black-ish’ made a very big shift in the opportunities that were accessible to me,” she said, adding that they came at a time “when my ego kind of had let go of them.”
She spoke, by Zoom and phone, from her home in Los Angeles, where she has been holed up during the coronavirus pandemic, learning to record the voice-overs for “mixed-ish” from her bedroom. “My discomfort is a privilege,” she said, “when people’s livelihoods are gone, and they have no sense of when and how they will find another paycheck, when the unemployment rate is so high, and it’s mostly the black and brown women who have been affected.
“Today’s heart is very heavy and broken,” Ross added. It was two days after George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, died, pleading, “I can’t breathe,” to the white police officer who kept a knee on his neck; across the country, protests against police brutality were beginning.
Her movie, the culmination of a lifelong dream, deals with inequality, sexism, ageism and racism — now, Ross was also grateful that it might be an escape. “The movie is bright and joyful and a feel-good movie,” she said, “that hopefully will offer people a small respite, in the midst of so much heavy stuff.”
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Was it always on the table for you to sing in the movie?
A: Yeah. It was a childhood dream of mine. I don’t know where consciously or unconsciously it kind of got put aside. And it’s also not that I haven’t sung. I sang the opening title song to the show I did on Lifetime in the ’90s [“The Dish”]. I sang in talent shows in high school. I have always wanted to sing, and I also have always really wanted the right movie to come along. Like, if I look back at old vision boards, when I was making vision boards, I had put on there that I wanted to do a musical biopic or a musical on Broadway, and also longing to find the right movie role.
I think I hoped I could sing, too, and until I got into that studio and finally heard myself for the first time, it was all a bit of a “who knows?” Sure, I’ve done some comedic singing, and I’ve done some hosting singing, and I’ve definitely sang in the car and the shower. But me with a microphone in my face — oh my God. So it was purposeful and also magical that this was a special enough role to encourage me to walk through my terror.
Q: I often hear from performers that they like to take jobs that slightly terrify them. Are you one of those kinds of actors?
A: I think I’m one of those people. I wouldn’t say I’m a skydiver, but I lean toward things that are healthy risky behavior, that allow me to stretch and grow and become more whole, and explore parts of myself that seem like we should never touch. It’s not that I get off on it. I become more from it.
This is the kind of person I am: I want to do something, and then I just run and jump off the edge, and at some point, once I land on the bottom — whether my knees are broken, my ankles are broken, or whatever it is — that’s when I get scared. I don’t usually get afraid while it’s happening, but when it’s finished, I’m like, “What did I just do?” And then I go through these cycles of shame and cold sweats.
I remember somewhere along my journey discovering that about myself, and going, “You know, Tracee, there’s elevators, stairs, bridges, ladders. There’s all of these different ways that you can actually come down from the cliff. You don’t have to just think you have wings.”
The TED Talk was another example. What was I thinking? They wanted me to be funny, and I was like, “The talk I’ve written has nothing to do with humor.” [It was about female rage.] I was supposed to be on the first day of the conference, and like three hours before it was supposed to start, they were like, “We’d love you to actually open.” I was like, “Open what?” They were like, “Be the first person.” And I was like, “That sounds like a horrible idea. Are you insane? Sure. I’ll do it.”
Q: You’ve said that during “Girlfriends,” you were surprised that the doors of Hollywood didn’t open wider. Did that change after “black-ish”? Did the movie roles come then?
A: During “Girlfriends,” not only did the pearly gates of Hollywood not open, it was still locked. I was like, “Oh, is there a key? There’s no key? Nothing here? OK. Cool.”
I think once “black-ish” started and then particularly once I won the Golden Globe, there was a shift for me. It’s a combination, honestly, of the Golden Globe and the hair company, and realizing that some of my biggest, oldest dreams were happening. My manager said, “What do you want to be doing? Let’s be purposeful about it. I think you’ve got to dream some new dreams.” And I was like, “Holy moly. I’ve had these dreams for so long! How do you start dreaming new dreams when you’ve had the same ones for so long?”
I went through this realization of, I’ve spent a lot of years taking what I was given and trying to make it into something that feels good, whether it was really what I wanted or just what I was offered. And realizing, if I’m going to do a movie at this point after waiting this long, what kind of movie do I want to do? What’s the right one?
And then this script came along, and it felt like it was sent from heaven. I chased this.
Q: Did you consult on the script?
A: We all did. First of all, at 47 years old and as outspoken as I am, and with as clear of a point of view as I have about life — particularly about sharing stories and narratives of black women — yes, I spoke up. And it was wonderful working with a director [Nisha Ganatra], a woman of color, who had a sensitivity, a willingness and openness to dive into areas with care that needed to be looked at.
Our writer, Flora [Greeson] — she has become one of my closest friends — had a real willingness to say, “If that snags you, then we really need to take a look at it — like, I’m not a black woman. Let’s get a little crew of us together where we have enough diverse voices here so we can sort this out.”
That’s something I always think when I work, even if it makes people uncomfortable.
Q: What is your relationship with Kenya Barris like, now that you are co-producers on “mixed-ish” and you’re portraying something based on his family?
A: It started as portraying his life, but we’re so far from his experiences. We’re telling the stories coming out of the writers’ room. So although my character’s name is his wife’s name, I don’t think of it that way anymore.
And then there’s his [Netflix] show, “#BlackAF”; that is also his story. Everyone keeps asking me if Rashida [Jones, who plays his wife on that show] is actually married to Kenya. I’m like, “Oh my God, people, you don’t get it.”
And then, by the way, there’s all this stuff out there that I’m dating Kenya. I’m like, “Guys, what is going on? This is crazy.” Kenya was on “Girlfriends,” and so we have this longstanding friendship. We worked very similarly on “black-ish,” even though I was not a producer. We’ve always done that kind of producer-ial partner thing together, like running work things by each other.
Executive producing for me is very similar to running my hair company. Very different from acting. I feel like I act from my gut and my heart, and I produce and run a company from my mind.
Q: A theme in the film is the difficulty of being in the shadow of an iconic artist, and the pressures on a star who is also a parent. Is that something you related to?
A: I think that was the one place where the idea of being someone’s child — the world doesn’t realize the intricacy of just what that is. I know in the case of my mom, everything in her life is about making it good for her children. Everything she does is just about, how can she love us more, better and more fully? Diana Ross is one thing, but my mom is an exceptional love. So to think that anything of her job, life, career, gift, any of that would have made it difficult in any way for her children, I think would devastate her.
Perhaps because I was walking through the singing part of it, it just did not dawn on me that people were going to be like, “Is this a story of your mother?” No. It has nothing to do with it. I didn’t even think about it, guys.
Q: What was the most egregious thing you’ve witnessed someone asking of their assistant? Your character is not a monster, but she does ask her assistant to give her an enema.
A: When I first got the script, I was like, “Guys, we have to take this out. Nobody does this.” It got down to the moment we were shooting the scene, and again I was like, “Guys, nobody would do this.” And Dakota goes [low voice], “People do it.”
I’m like, “Are you [expletive] kidding me? This is not the way I operate. My assistants don’t do anything like that.”
This is one of the places where, because of whose child I am, I felt very protective of not creating a caricature. I don’t even remember my mom having an assistant, and she doesn’t have one now. That’s not what I was raised with.
I do know that some larger-than-life people are ridiculous in how they behave and treat people around them. I’ve witnessed it. But I have great compassion for the amount of care and vulnerability that has to exist underneath that artistry, and that the closest people to you are sometimes your assistants or your publicist or your manager, and they do get the hard stuff because it’s got to go somewhere. I’ve had moments where my assistant is the person that gets the tears of, “I can’t do it. Literally don’t put another thing on my schedule, like there’s no food in the schedule. I’m starving, and I’m tired.” [Miming ugly crying.]
Q: So, wait. Nothing in the character reminded you of your mom?
A: I mean, of course it did. I was playing a superstar music lady. But I wasn’t like: “Yes, this is a moment that reminds me of when my mother did…” — no, not at all; or let me do my “this is me being my mom.” Literally, it just didn’t come up for me. The only way it came up for me was, I was very convinced that Grace Davis wore fake eyelashes. Tracee hates them. That she always wore really high heels. I wear Birkenstocks. That she had stage hair and home hair, and life hair. These were things — which again have nothing to do with my mother — these were just things I wanted to do character-wise. But when Tracee puts on eyelashes and a whole bunch of hair, it’s inevitable. I look like my mom’s child. She spit me out.
[But] I get it. I really do. I’ve been my mom’s child for 47 years. I am very aware of the magnitude of her impact in the world, the bigness of her planet, the fact that her career absolutely is part of the reason that I can do what I do in my career. From a professional standpoint, I absolutely get it, and it wasn’t the case.
I was busy living my life. I was busy trying to do something that scared me.

NEW YORK — Thousands of demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd in Minnesota took to the streets of New York City for a third day Saturday, blocking traffic, tagging police cars with graffiti and massing at separate marches in Harlem, Brooklyn, Queens and outside Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan.
In the late afternoon, protesters in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn confronted police in a series of push-and-pull street melees, hurling empty bottles and pieces of debris at officers who responded with billy clubs and pepper spray.
The skirmishes came one day after far more violent protests erupted outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where some in the crowd hurled bottles and firebombs at police. More than 200 arrests were made Friday. It remained unclear how many arrests were made Saturday.
As the city woke Saturday morning to images of police officers violently shoving protesters and police vehicles burning in the street, Mayor Bill de Blasio denounced the previous night’s events, issuing an urgent plea for calm while saying he understood the deep anger over racism and police killings that had spurred the demonstrations.
The mayor promised that any police officers who had used unnecessary force during the clashes would be held accountable, and he announced an independent inquiry to be led by the state attorney general’s office into how police had handled Friday night’s protests.
“Any aggressive act toward a peaceful protester sends exactly the wrong message,” de Blasio said at a news conference, referring to videos that show violent acts of apparent police. “We will not accept that kind of behavior. It is unacceptable.”
But de Blasio and the police commissioner, Dermot Shea, said that hundreds of demonstrators had come to the rallies Friday night with the intent to brawl with police. A firearm was recovered from one protester and a set of brass knuckles from another. Some protesters came with bricks and threw them at officers, Shea said. A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an occupied police van at around 1 a.m., Shea said.
Samantha Shader, 27, of the Catskills region, was arrested in connection with the tossing of the Molotov cocktail and charged with four counts of attempted murder, assault and arson, police said. While the firebomb she threw shattered a rear window of the van, the officers inside managed to jump out.
Friday’s protests had begun peacefully, with hundreds chanting, “Black lives matter,” and, “We want justice,” around Foley Square in lower Manhattan.
Councilman Donovan Richards, a Queens Democrat who is chairman of the council’s public safety committee, said the city’s black communities were feeling under siege by what they see as excessive policing.
“I’m feeling their growing tension,” said Richards, who is black. “It is difficult to be a black American at the moment. We are getting hit hard. We are seeing that our lives are not valued.”
But the unrest intensified hours later in Brooklyn as protesters arrived at Barclays Center, where dozens of police officers were waiting with twist-tie handcuffs hanging from their belts and Department of Corrections buses for those who were arrested. A police helicopter and a large drone whirred in the hot air overhead.
On Saturday, the demonstrations started around 1 p.m. with several hundred protesters gathering on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard in Harlem.
Calling out Floyd’s name, the crowd moved down toward the 28th precinct station house, where it confronted a phalanx of officers with shouts of, “Black lives matter,” and, “No justice, no peace.”
Shortly after, the protesters made their way onto the West Side Highway, bringing traffic to a standstill.
Within hours, other crowds had appeared in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, in Times Square and outside Trump Tower, where at least seven people were arrested.

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota activated thousands of additional National Guard troops to send to Minneapolis but declined the Army’s offer to deploy military police units, as days of protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody, threatened to boil over even further on Saturday.
Walz, a Democrat, acknowledged that officials had underestimated the demonstrations in Minneapolis, where despite a newly issued curfew, people burned buildings and turned the city’s streets into a smoldering battleground on Friday night. He compared the havoc to wars that Americans have fought overseas, and said he expected even more unrest on Saturday night.
“What you’ve seen in previous nights, I think, will be dwarfed by what they will do tonight,” he said.
The protests surged even after the arrest of the officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on Monday, leading to charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter by Friday. The national anger and sorrow fueled by a widely shared video of the encounter, left Minneapolis convulsing with fires and police confrontations and galvanized protests in cities across the country, including Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta and Washington.
Protests in Louisville, Kentucky, also focused on the death of Breonna Taylor, a young black emergency medical technician shot dead when police officers burst through her apartment door in March.
With further protests planned across the country Saturday, President Donald Trump urged officials in Minnesota to “get tougher” and offered the support of the military, the use of which would represent a significant escalation in the government’s response to the tensions.
Pentagon officials said that Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke Friday with Walz, to express “willingness” to deploy military police units. The governor declined the offer, the officials said, and has since activated all of the state’s national guard troops, up to 13,200.
Nonetheless, the U.S. Northern Command has put several military police units on four-hour status, which means they could be ready to deploy in four hours, as opposed to a day.
State and federal officials have increasingly condemned the protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere, which have at times been peaceful and other times marked by fires, looting and vandalism.
Commissioner John Harrington of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that there had been “tens of thousands” of people in the streets on Friday, more than any other night since Floyd’s death on Monday set off a wave of protests that have become increasingly destructive across the country.
Minnesota officials said it appeared that some of the more violent protesters were from out of the state, and Attorney General William Barr on Saturday denounced radical “agitators” who he said had their own personal agendas. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, looking weary after four days of outrage in his city, pleaded with residents to go home and stop burning down the local businesses that he said were even more vital in the middle of a pandemic.
“You’re not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town,” Frey said. “You’re not getting back at anybody.”
Trump urges Minnesota officials to ‘get tougher,’ and Barr threatens rioters with prosecution.
Trump on Saturday criticized the authorities in Minnesota for allowing protests to turn violent, and offered the help of the military to contain further protests over the death of Floyd, which escalated this week with the burning of a police station and other buildings in Minneapolis.
“They have to get tougher, and by being tougher they will be honoring his memory,” Trump said on the South Lawn of the White House, adding: “When I saw the policemen running out of a police station for that police station to be abandoned and taken over, I’ve never seen anything so horrible and stupid in my life.”
”We have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military,” he said. “We could have troops on the ground very quickly.”
His comments, paired with a series of tweets on Saturday, threatened to inflame an already tense situation that has played out in protests across the country and in front of the White House.
In one tweet, he called demonstrators who gathered at the White House on Friday night “professionally managed so-called ‘protesters’” and suggested that his supporters would march outside the White House on Saturday.
“Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???” he tweeted.
Asked later whether the tweet might invited more racial violence, Trump demurred. “These are people that love our country,” he said of his supporters. “I have no idea if they were going to be here, I was just asking.”
“By the way,” he added, “they love African-American people, they love black people.”
Trump also praised the Secret Service’s response to the earlier White House protest in stark terms and criticized Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington, saying the capital’s police didn’t do enough to contain the protests.
His latest comments came after he injected himself into the national tension over race and police brutality on Friday with tweets that called the protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The comment echoed a phrase coined by a Miami police chief in the 1960s about crackdowns on black neighborhoods during times of unrest, and was quickly seized upon by his national critics. Twitter also labeled the tweet as violating its terms of service for “glorifying violence.”
Trump later said he was unaware of the phrase’s history and walked back his comments, saying that he meant that “looting leads to shooting” and “I don’t want this to happen.”
Barr, who has vowed for a swift federal investigation into Floyd’s death, also weighed in Saturday, issuing a stern warning to left-wing “agitators” who he said were exploiting the protests to pursue their own goals.
Barr, at a brief news conference, said outrage over the death of Floyd, 46, was “real and legitimate,” but said justice must be served through the courts, not through the rioting that has overtaken several of the nation’s largest cities. Barr warned that protesters who cross state lines to “incite or participate in violent rioting” may be violating federal laws and that the Justice Department would pursue cases against them.
“The voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements,” Barr said. “Groups of outside radicals are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.”
The U.S. attorney in Minnesota is investigating the officer’s actions for possible violations of civil rights laws or other federal crimes.
Fires and vandalism erupted across the country, and protests spread to Atlanta, New York and many other cities.
Rallies expanded far beyond Minneapolis on Friday, with protesters destroying police vehicles in Atlanta and New York, and blocking major streets in San Jose, California, and Detroit. Crowds in Milwaukee chanted, “I can’t breathe” and demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, lit a fire inside the Multnomah County Justice Center.
Hundreds of demonstrators poured into the streets near Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park, smashing windows and clashing with police officers. Not far away, some people climbed atop a large red CNN sign outside the media company’s headquarters and spray-painted messages on it. Others shattered windows at the College Football Hall of Fame, where people rushed in and emerged with branded fan gear.
“What are you changing by tearing up a city?” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a news conference. “You’ve lost all credibility now. This is not how we change America. This is not how we change the world.”
Protests in Los Angeles ended with more than 500 arrests. Police released a statement saying they were still assessing the property damage, and that “numerous downtown businesses” had been damaged and looted.
Police in Houston arrested nearly 200 people who took part in what they said were “unlawful assemblies” throughout Friday and early Saturday morning. In a Twitter post, police officials said most of those arrested would be charged with obstructing a roadway. In scuffles, four officers received minor injuries, and eight police vehicles were damaged.
In New York, thousands of people attended a demonstration at the perimeter of Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Some hurled bottles and debris at police officers, who responded with pepper spray.
A burned police van was still smoking near Fort Greene Park after two Fire Department trucks pulled away. Protesters slammed its doors off their hinges, threw fireworks into the charred seats, flattened the tires and placed a sign down that read, “Black Lives Matter.”
“I’m just really tired of sitting at home and just doing nothing, basically watching this happen,” said Jason Phillips, 27, of Queens, who was at an earlier protest in Manhattan. “I need to be a part of history. I need to be a part of the change.”
More protests were expected on Saturday, and the city of Portland, Oregon, imposed its own curfew for Saturday night.
W ife of officer is seeking a divorce.
The intensifying protests came after authorities announced that the officer who pinned George Floyd to the ground had been arrested and charged with murder on Friday, a development that activists and Floyd’s family had called for but also said did not go far enough.
The officer, Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, charges that come with a combined maximum sentence of 35 years.
An investigation into the three other officers who were present at the scene remains ongoing.
Floyd’s relatives have said that had wanted the more serious charge of first-degree murder.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.” Charges of first- and second-degree murder require prosecutors to prove, in almost all cases, that the perpetrator made a decision to kill the victim.
A lawyer for Chauvin’s wife, Kellie, said that she was devastated by Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for his family and those grieving his loss. The case has also led Kellie Chauvin to seek a divorce, the lawyer, Amanda Mason-Sekula, said in an interview on Friday night.

NEW YORK — Samuel Roberts, a professor at Columbia University, remembered being stopped by the police as he walked his Rottweiler along Morningside Drive after someone reported that a black man was robbing people with a dog in tow.
Tamiesha Parris Flatts, a nurse at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, recalled how once, when she was slow to get out of a New York City cab, the driver of the car behind called her a racial slur.
Ryan Brown, who works for the job search website Indeed, recalled all the times he had gone shopping and was mistaken for a store employee.
It didn’t take a video of a white dog owner falsely accusing a black man to remind black New Yorkers that even a proudly progressive city that likes to brag about diversity can also be hostile and racist.
Even so, the video dredged up memories, some old, some fresh, of their own experiences being profiled and confronted, while walking their own dogs, hailing a cab, and otherwise living in New York while black.
New York City’s image as a place of integration and harmony has long been a draw for people of all cultures and identities. But the video chipped away at that image, which some had held onto out of psychological necessity but had always regarded as a thin veneer.
“I cried last night,” said Parris Flatts, 36, as she stood on Wednesday in the Ramble in Central Park with her 4-year-old daughter, near the spot where the now-infamous standoff occurred.
The video of that encounter, as well as the recording of another black man, George Floyd, dying in the custody of the Minneapolis police, was still weighing heavily on her. “When does this stop? How many videos do we need to see? How many?”
The confrontation between Amy Cooper, a white woman walking her cocker spaniel, and Christian Cooper, a black bird watcher, has been seen more than 40 million times since being posted on Twitter by Christian Cooper’s sister.
Christian Cooper had asked Amy Cooper, no relation, to restrain her dog, and when she didn’t, he started recording her. She is seen calling 911 and telling the dispatcher that an African American man is threatening her and the dog. “Please send the cops immediately,” she says breathlessly.
She issued an apology after she had become a pariah on social media and lost her dog to the rescue agency she had adopted from. She soon lost her job at an investment firm as well.
Her shift in the video from indignation to damsel-in-distress inflection troubled many people, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he was “appalled.”
“It was literally an effort to criminalize being a black man in America,” he said.
De Blasio, who is white, is married to a black woman, Chirlane McCray, and they have two biracial children, living symbols of New York’s diversity. But the city also has one of the most segregated school systems in the country, and many neighborhoods remain dominated by one race or ethnicity, creating spaces that can sometimes feel inherently white or black, Hispanic or Asian.
In interviews, several black New Yorkers noted how the incident took place in Central Park, which is theoretically an oasis for all but can still be demarcated by race, with the sections closest to white neighborhoods, including the Ramble, feeling like white spaces. And for many people, especially black and Hispanic people, Central Park is also synonymous with the Central Park Five, the teenagers wrongly accused of raping a jogger there in 1989.
“One of the reasons, among many, that people in New York City are particularly riled up about this video and about this person is we know about what happened to those five young men who were exonerated after having their lives derailed forever because of faulty police work, a lying investigator, botched interviews, et cetera, et cetera, all because of something that happened in Central Park,” said Taja-Nia Henderson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, dean of the Rutgers Graduate School-Newark and a longtime New Yorker.
“We know that Central Park itself is built on land formerly owned by a free black community,” she continued. “Central Park itself is special in a lot of ways. For all that to be in the background of that case makes it emotional for a lot of us who live in the city. This isn’t just a confrontation in any old park.”
Brown, who was a young child when the jogger attack occurred, said that his parents taught him that he had to navigate the city differently.
“I used to work across from Central Park and I used to jog in Central Park on my lunch breaks,” Brown, 33, said, “and even then, just growing up here, I would make sure I wouldn’t jog alone near any white women.”
He said he could easily see himself in Christian Cooper’s shoes. “It could have been a jogger,” he said. “It could have been a biker. It could have been a delivery guy. It could have been me.”
But Brown cannot avoid indignities altogether, finding himself a target while shopping in stores.
He said he usually lets it slide. “But then finally when I have the guts to say, ‘Why did you assume that I work here?’ they get very defensive: ‘I didn’t assume you work here!’”
“Well, OK, so now I’m the bad guy,” he said.
John Ballard, 51, a native New Yorker and a workplace consultant, said he found it painful to watch the video, having been emotionally exhausted from profiling incidents in his own life.
“You always try to comply but if this happens to you again, and again, and again, then at some point, I don’t care who you are, what your culture is, you’re going to get tired,” he said.
Dorian Graham, a television producer, remembered calming himself in an argument with a white woman on a plane at one of New York’s airports because inevitably “it will escalate into something it’s not.”
Graham, 53, who splits his time between Los Angeles and New York, said he has to tell his 20-year-old daughter to be more cognizant of the New York that lies outside her community in the Bronx: “Your neighborhood is black and Hispanic. That’s a bubble. That’s a hair follicle. The rest of the country is majority white.”
Henderson, the Rutgers dean, and Jamila Jefferson-Jones of the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law wrote a paper this year titled “#LivingWhileBlack: Blackness as Nuisance,” following a series of high-profile incidents of white citizens calling police on black people, from a woman who called the police on a group of black people barbecuing in a park in Oakland, California, to the white employee of a Starbucks in Philadelphia who called the police on two black patrons within minutes of them sitting down.
“In the most widely reported incidents, white people called the police on black people in public parks; at youth sporting events; at community pools; in retail stores; in university classrooms, dining halls and dormitories; in parking lots; and on the sidewalk, among other places,” the authors wrote.
These spaces are often racialized as white, and some white people call the police to keep that order, steps rooted in a post-slavery United States where law enforcement was used to carry out the separation of white and black people, the academics said in a joint interview.
“Jogging while black. Walking while black. Exercising while black. Reading while black. Whatever it might be,” said Jefferson-Jones, who is also interim director of the black studies program at her university. “The idea is that you are doing it in the wrong place and that it’s others who get to decide what your place is and where your place ought to be.”
By the time the police arrived at the Ramble on Monday morning, Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper were gone. “Had the police arrived, it’s very likely that Christian Cooper would have been arrested,” Jefferson-Jones said.
Roberts, the Columbia professor who recalled being profiled while walking his Rottweiler, did not avoid the police. He remembered the sound of screeching tires. “This cop car comes squealing around the corner,” said Roberts, 47, in an interview on Wednesday. “The police jumped out of the car with their hands on their weapons.”
He said, “It was one of the scariest moments of my life.”
He said he had so many similar instances of neighbors calling the police he finally reached out to the campus police and the local precinct to let them know he was a black man who walked his dog frequently.
“The most awkward conversation you can have with a police officer is diplomatically explaining you’re afraid they will shoot you,” said Roberts.
He recalled how he talked to officers about one woman in particular who he had a confrontation with because his dog was leashed and her dog was not. The police asked him if he was afraid of her. “Am I physically afraid of this older white woman, no?” he said he told them.
But, he said in the interview, she did wield a weapon: “She has a phone.”

Military Police Prepare to Deploy After 'Absolute Chaos' in Minneapolis [With graphic(s)]

The Defense Department ordered the Army to prepare active-duty military police units to deploy to Minneapolis as protests over the death of George Floyd engulfed the city for a fourth night Friday, with businesses set on fire and gunshots fired near a police precinct.
Officials said that the Army on Friday issued “prepare to deploy” orders for military police units from several bases around the country. The orders came at the behest of President Donald Trump, the officials said, as he has been seeking options from his senior national security leaders, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, for how to deal with the chaotic protests that have ignited in dozens of cities.
They continued with new ferocity Friday night even after Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was shown on a cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he lost consciousness, was charged with third-degree murder.
Already, National Guard units have been activated in Minnesota and in other cities — standard for dealing with civil unrest within the country. But deploying military police units would be an escalation in the government response to the unfolding events, officials said. Military police units were used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the acquittal of four officers involved in the beating of Rodney King.
In Minneapolis, flames streamed from several businesses overnight — a gas station, a post office, a bank, a restaurant — and protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew, milling in the streets and facing off with officers, even forcing Guard troops to retreat at one point.
The police did begin to arrest protesters shortly before midnight, when demonstrators convened on the Minneapolis Police Department’s Fifth Precinct the day after they had taken over the Third Precinct and set it on fire. Unlike Thursday, the police did not flee from the building.
Even as most demonstrators left the streets early Saturday, the fires continued to rage, leaving a trail of battered local businesses and hollowed out vehicles.
Gov. Tim Walz said that Minnesota was bracing for more protests Saturday and that the authorities had been overwhelmed by the demonstrations, which he said had devolved into “absolute chaos.” He did not rule out accepting the help of the federal military, although he called it an extreme step.
If the military police are ordered to descend on Minneapolis, the units at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York would likely be the first to be activated, officials said. The possible activation of the units was first reported by The Associated Press.
The “prepare to deploy” move does not mean that the units will be activated, the officials said, but it is a first step toward doing so.
Fires and vandalism continue as cities struggle to end protests.
Rallies expanded far beyond Minneapolis on Friday, with protesters destroying police vehicles in Atlanta and New York, and blocking major streets in San Jose, California, and Detroit. Crowds in Milwaukee chanted, “I can’t breathe” and demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, lit a fire inside the Multnomah County Justice Center.
Hundreds of demonstrators poured into the streets near Atlanta’s Centennial Olympic Park, smashing windows and clashing with police officers. Not far away, some people climbed atop a large red CNN sign outside the media company’s headquarters and spray-painted messages on it. Others shattered windows at the College Football Hall of Fame, where people rushed in and emerged with branded fan gear.
“What are you changing by tearing up a city?” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a news conference. “You’ve lost all credibility now. This is not how we change America. This is not how we change the world.”
In New York, thousands of people attended a demonstration at the perimeter of Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Some hurled bottles and debris at police officers, who responded with pepper spray.
A burned police van was still smoking near Fort Greene Park after two Fire Department trucks pulled away. Protesters slammed its doors off their hinges, threw fireworks into the charred seats, flattened the tires and placed a sign down that read, “Black Lives Matter.”
“I’m just really tired of sitting at home and just doing nothing, basically watching this happen,” said Jason Phillips, 27, of Queens, who was at an earlier protest in Manhattan. “I need to be a part of history. I need to be a part of the change.”
Minnesota governor: ‘There’s simply more of them than us .’
Minnesota’s top officials acknowledged early Saturday that they had underestimated the destruction that protesters in Minneapolis were capable of inflicting as a newly issued curfew did little to stop people from burning buildings and turning the city’s streets into a smoky battleground.
Walz said at a news conference that the police and National Guard soldiers had been overwhelmed by protesters set on causing destruction days after George Floyd was pinned to the ground by an officer before dying.
“Quite candidly, right now, we do not have the numbers,” Walz said. “We cannot arrest people when we’re trying to hold ground because of the sheer size, the dynamics and the wanton violence that’s coming out there.”
Politicians and the police had not expected the protests to grow for a fourth night Friday. But grow they did, and law enforcement officers struggled to hold their ground, with National Guard troops retreating from angry protesters at one point.
“There’s simply more of them than us” Walz said of the protesters.
The governor vowed that more Guard troops would be deployed and that the authorities would not let the destruction continue. Even so, state officials did not show much optimism that the demonstrations would stop, and Walz did not rule out the possibility of bringing in the military.
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, looking weary after four days of outrage in his city, pleaded with residents to go home and stop burning down the local businesses that he said were even more vital in the middle of a pandemic.
“You’re not getting back at the police officer that tragically killed George Floyd by looting a town,” Frey said. “You’re not getting back at anybody.”

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said on Saturday that he was activating thousands of National Guard troops to suppress protesters in Minneapolis who turned out in droves for the fourth night in a row on Friday, burning buildings to the ground, firing guns near the police and overwhelming officers.
“Our goal is to decimate that force as quickly as possible,” Walz said of the rioters who have been causing the damage, a group that he said was different from demonstrators who protested against police brutality after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after being pinned down by a white officer. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder on Friday.
The move by Walz to activate all of the state’s available Guard troops — up to 13,200 — comes after protesters defied a newly imposed curfew on Friday night and set a string of businesses on fire, including a bank, a restaurant and a gas station.
Commissioner John Harrington of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that there had been “tens of thousands” of people in the streets, more than any other night since Floyd’s death on Monday set off a wave of protests across the country that have become increasingly destructive.
Walz compared the havoc the protesters had wrought on Minneapolis to wars that Americans have fought overseas and said he expected even more unrest on Saturday night.
“What you’ve seen in previous nights, I think, will be dwarfed by what they will do tonight,” he said.
More law enforcement officers will be patrolling the streets in Minneapolis and St. Paul than ever before, officials said. Walz also said he would not rule out requesting a few hundred additional troops from the federal government.
At the orders of President Donald Trump, the Defense Department has ordered the Army to prepare active-duty military police units to deploy from several army bases to Minneapolis.
Minnesota officials said it appeared that some of the more violent protesters were from out of the state. The people who defied the curfew on Friday had launched fireworks at police officers, set cars and buildings ablaze and forced Guard troops to retreat at one point before they returned to clear people away from the Police Department’s 5th Precinct.
Harrington said officials had thought the protests might smolder after Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was shown on a cellphone video kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he lost consciousness, was charged with third-degree murder.
But they have only gotten worse.
The police began arresting protesters shortly before midnight, when they convened at the 5th Precinct the day after they had taken over the 3rd Precinct and set it on fire. Unlike Thursday, the police did not flee from the building.
Even as most demonstrators left the streets early Saturday, the fires continued to rage, leaving a trail of battered local businesses and hollowed-out vehicles.
Fires and vandalism continue as cities struggle to end protests.
Rallies expanded far beyond Minneapolis on Friday, with protesters destroying police vehicles in Atlanta and New York, and blocking major streets in San Jose, California, and Detroit.

“I’m just really tired of sitting at home and just doing nothing, basically watching this happen,” said Jason Phillips, 27, of Queens, who was at an earlier protest in Manhattan. “I need to be a part of history. I need to be a part of the change.”
‘There’s simply more of them than us ’: Walz addresses the destruction in Minnesota.
Minnesota’s top officials acknowledged Saturday morning that they had underestimated the destruction that protesters in Minneapolis were capable of inflicting as a newly issued curfew did little to stop people from burning buildings and turning the city’s streets into a smoky battleground.

The police in Minneapolis began arresting protesters who defied a newly issued curfew Friday night to swarm smoky intersections on the fourth night of protests since George Floyd’s death in police custody.
Gunshots rang out near a police precinct and flames streamed from several businesses — a gas station, a post office, a bank, a restaurant — as residents continued to show their anger even after a police officer was charged with third-degree murder.
Protesters marched peacefully for much of the day in Minneapolis, but the demonstrations escalated around 11 p.m. local time, three hours after a curfew went into effect for the first time since Floyd’s death. Demonstrations were held in dozens of cities, several of which turned destructive, including those in Atlanta, New York and San Jose, California.
In Minneapolis, protesters gathered near the Police Department’s 5th Precinct the day after they had taken over another precinct and set it on fire. Unlike Thursday, the police did not abandon the precinct, even as shots were reportedly fired in the area. Several protesters were arrested for refusing to disperse, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said on Twitter.
In a late-night tweet, Gov. Tim Walz urged residents to “go home immediately,” saying the streets were not safe for civilians or emergency workers.
Paul Gazelka, the Republican majority leader of the state Senate, told the KARE 11 news that he was frustrated the police had not acted more swiftly to clear the streets.
“You cannot allow anarchy,” he said. “You cannot allow this lawlessness to continue.”
Walz, who activated the National Guard on Thursday as local police appeared to lose control over demonstrators, had extended the curfew to St. Paul and said guardsmen would return to the streets in anticipation of more protests.
During a news conference Friday, the governor said officials should have anticipated that the protests could become violent, but he said it was unrealistic to expect law enforcement to stop people from coming out to demonstrate, even amid the social-distancing orders that have been imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Watching what happened to George Floyd had people say, ‘To hell with staying home,’” he said. “The idea that we would go in and break up those expressions of grief and rage was ridiculous.”
Walz acknowledged that the Minneapolis police had lost the trust of city residents, but he implored residents to see the National Guard as a peacekeeping force meant to keep “anarchists” from taking over and destroying more of the city.
“I need to ask Minnesotans, those in pain and those who feel like justice has not been served yet, you need to help us create the space so that justice will be served,” the governor said. “It is my expectation that it will be swift.”
Days of protests had intensified Thursday night when the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct stationhouse was overrun by a crowd of protesters, with some people tossing fireworks and other items at officers, while the police fired projectiles back.
Officers retreated in vehicles just after 10 p.m. Thursday local time as protesters stormed the building — smashing equipment, lighting fires and setting off fireworks, according to videos posted from the scene.
Frey, a Democrat, said he understood the anger of the city’s residents but pleaded with people to stop destroying property and looting stores. “It’s not just enough to do the right thing yourself,” he said. “We need to be making sure that all of us are held accountable.”
Protesters across the country blocked highways across and clashed with the police.
Chanting “Hands up! Don’t shoot,” and “I can’t breathe,” thousands of protesters gathered in cities across the country Friday night after a fired Minneapolis police officer was charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death.
Crowds shut down Los Angeles freeways, clashed with the police in Dallas and defaced the CNN Center in Atlanta, where Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms declared, “This is not how we change America.”
Demonstrators in many other cities, including New York, also gathered to voice their anger:
— A large crowd in Washington chanted outside the White House, prompting the Secret Service to temporarily lock down the building. Video on social media showed demonstrators knocking down barricades and spray-painting other buildings.
— A march in Houston, where Floyd grew up, briefly turned chaotic as the windows of a police SUV were smashed and at least 12 protesters were arrested. As a standoff continued, the police shut all roads into and out of downtown. “We don’t want these young people’s legitimate grievances and legitimate concerns to be overshadowed by a handful of provocateurs and anarchists,” the city’s police chief, Art Acevedo, said in an interview.
— Images from news helicopters above San Jose, California, showed protesters throwing objects at police officers, blocking a major freeway and setting fires downtown. Mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview that he watched from City Hall as a peaceful protest — what he called people “expressing their righteous outrage on the injustice in Minneapolis” — turned violent.
— Demonstrators in Los Angeles blocked the 110 Freeway, marching through downtown and around Staples Center. Local television footage showed police officers clashing with a crowd suspected of vandalizing a patrol car. By 9:30 p.m., LAPD had declared all of downtown to be an unlawful assembly and was warning residents of the loft districts to stay inside.
— “Black is not a crime,” declared a small crowd gathered outside police headquarters in Detroit . Mary Sheffield, a member of the City Council, led a chant, proclaiming, “I’m fired up. I’m fed up.” The demonstration later swelled to more than 1,000 protesters, who blocked traffic while marching on major thoroughfares leading downtown.
— In downtown Dallas , protesters and the police clashed during a demonstration blocks from City Hall. Protesters blocked the path of a police vehicle and then started banging on its hood. Officers eventually responded with tear gas, and a flash-bang was later heard.
— In Portland, Oregon , demonstrators broke into the Multnomah County Justice Center and lit a fire inside the building late Friday night, authorities said.
— Hundreds of protesters converged on Civic Center Park in Denver , waving signs and chanting as Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” played over a loudspeaker. Some thrust fists in the air and scrawled messages on the ground in chalk, according to a news broadcast.
— Protesters in Milwaukee briefly shut down part of a major highway, according to WTMJ-TV, and demonstrators shouted “I can’t breathe” — echoing Floyd’s anguished plea and the words of Eric Garner, a black man who died in New York police custody in 2014.
Fired officer is charged with third-degree murder after Floyd’s death.
The former Minneapolis police officer who was seen on video using his knee to pin down Floyd, who died shortly after, was arrested and charged with murder, the authorities announced Friday.
The former officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said. An investigation into the other three officers who were present at the scene Monday was continuing, he said.
Floyd’s relatives said in a statement that they were disappointed by the decision not to seek first-degree murder charges. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after pleading “I can’t breathe” while Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, in an encounter that was captured on video.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.” Charges of first- and second-degree murder require prosecutors to prove, in almost all cases, that the perpetrator made a decision to kill the victim.
Chauvin, 44, was also charged with second-degree manslaughter, a charge that requires prosecutors to prove he was so negligent as to create an “unreasonable risk,” and consciously took the chance that his actions would cause Floyd, 46, to be severely harmed or die.
Camille Gage, 63, an artist and musician who joined the protests, said she was relieved that Chauvin had been charged. “How can anyone watch that video and think it was anything less?” she said. “Such blatant disregard for another living soul.”
The developments came after a night of chaos in which protesters set fire to a police station in Minneapolis, the National Guard was deployed to help restore order, and President Donald Trump injected himself into the mix with tweets that appeared to threaten violence against protesters.
Walz, a Democrat, expressed solidarity with the protesters during a news conference Friday but said that a return to order was needed to lift up the voices of “those who are expressing rage and anger and those who are demanding justice” and “not those who throw firebombs.”
A lawyer for Chauvin’s wife, Kellie, said that she was devastated by Floyd’s death and expressed sympathy for his family and those grieving his loss. The case has also led Chauvin to seek a divorce, the lawyer, Amanda Mason-Sekula, said in an interview Friday night.
Trump, who previously called the video of Floyd’s death “shocking,” drew criticism for a tweet early Friday that called the protesters “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The comments prompted Twitter to attach a warning to the tweet, saying that it violated the company’s rules about “glorifying violence.”
The president gave his first extensive remarks on the protests later Friday at the White House, declaring that “we can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos. It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody, that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory.”
Addressing his earlier Twitter comments, Trump said, “The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters. They hurt so badly what is happening.”
Police cars and a CNN sign are vandalized as unrest grows in Atlanta.
A demonstration turned destructive in Atlanta on Friday night as hundreds of protesters took to the streets, smashing windows and clashing with the police.
They gathered around Centennial Olympic Park, the city’s iconic tourist destination. People jumped on police cars. Some climbed atop a large red CNN sign outside the media company’s headquarters and spray-painted messages on it. Others threw rocks at the glass doors of the Omni Hotel and shattered windows at the College Football Hall of Fame, where people rushed in and emerged with branded fan gear.
Jay Clay, 19, an Atlanta resident and graphic designer, watched the protests from across a street with a mixture of curiosity and solidarity.
“After all this injustice and prejudice, people get fed up,” Clay said. “I wanted to come down and check it out. But this feels like it’s getting out of hand.”
The mayor pleaded for calm as the demonstrations unfolded.
“It’s enough. You need to go home,” Bottoms said. “We are all angry. This hurts. This hurts everybody in this room. But what are you changing by tearing up a city? You’ve lost all credibility now. This is not how we change America. This is not how we change the world.”
Bernice King, the youngest daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also spoke at the news conference, invoking her father’s legacy.
“Violence in fact creates more problems. It is not a solution,” King said. She said she felt and understood the anger of protesters but added, “There are people who would try to incite a race war in this country. Let’s not fall into their hands and into their trap. There’s another way.”
As the protests went on, police officers in riot gear were gathering. By 9:30 p.m., tear gas canisters were launched, and a wave of protesters ran back toward the park.
Officers and protesters trade projectiles outside Barclays Center in New York.
Tensions flared in New York for the second night in a row as thousands of protesters stormed the perimeter of Barclays Center in Brooklyn, trading projectiles of plastic water bottles, debris, and tear gas and mace with police officers.
The protest had begun peacefully Friday afternoon, with hundreds chanting, “Black lives matter,” and, “We want justice,” in downtown Manhattan. But the demonstrations took a turn in Brooklyn, where officers made between 50 and 100 arrests, a senior police official said.
Officers with twist-tie handcuffs hanging from their belts stood next to Department of Corrections buses and squad cars with lights flashing, encircling the perimeter. A police helicopter and a large drone whirred in the hot air overhead.
Protesters were later seen throwing water bottles, an umbrella and other objects at officers, who responded by shooting tear gas into the crowd.
As that crowd scattered, protesters gathered in the streets in the nearby Fort Greene neighborhood, continuing to chant at the police. An empty patrol van was set ablaze, then pillaged, as people pried the doors off the hinges. Fireworks were thrown into the burned shell of the vehicle. Scribbled on the hood was the phrase “dead cops.”
By 10 p.m., riot police had descended on the neighborhood. Another police official had described the scene in parts of the borough as “out of control.”
Earlier in the evening, several hundred people filled Foley Square near the city’s criminal courthouses. After a man in a green sweatshirt crossed a police barricade, he was swarmed by officers while protesters screamed. He was led away on foot in handcuffs.
“It was kind of his mistake,” said Jason Phillips, 27, of Queens. “But they were trying to push him back, and as they pushed him back, he slipped, and they took that as some type of threat.”
Despite the frustrations of demonstrators Friday, police said the number of people detained was much smaller than the night before, when 72 people were arrested.
Floyd was pinned for minutes while unresponsive, prosecutors said.
In a probable cause affidavit released Friday after the charges against Chauvin were filed, prosecutors said that the former officer held his knee to Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. “Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive,” the affidavit said.
But preliminary results from an autopsy indicated that Floyd did not die from suffocation or strangulation, prosecutors wrote, and that “the combined effects” of an underlying heart condition, any potential intoxicants and the police restraint likely contributed to his death. He also began complaining that he could not breathe before he was pinned down, the affidavit said.
The officers’ body cameras were running throughout the encounter, prosecutors said.
Four officers responded to a report at about 8 p.m. Monday about a man suspected of making a purchase from a store with a fake $20 bill, prosecutors said. After learning that the man was parked near the store, the first two responding officers, who did not include Chauvin, approached Floyd, a former high school sports star who worked as a bouncer at a restaurant in Minneapolis.
Floyd, who was in a car with two other people, was ordered out and arrested. But when the officers began to move him toward a squad car, he stiffened and resisted, according to the affidavit. While still standing, Floyd began to say he could not breathe, the affidavit said.
That was when Chauvin, who was among two other officers who arrived at the scene, got involved, prosecutors said. Around 8:19 p.m., Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the squad car and placed his knee onto Floyd’s neck area, holding him down on the ground while another officer held his legs. At times, Floyd pleaded, the affidavit said, saying, “I can’t breathe,” “please” and “mama.”
“You are talking fine,” the officers said, according to the affidavit, as Floyd wrestled on the ground.
At 8:24 p.m., Floyd went still, prosecutors said. A minute later, one of the other officers checked his wrist for a pulse but could not find one. Chauvin continued to hold his knee down on Floyd’s neck until 8:27, according to the affidavit.
The other officers, who have been identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, are under investigation. Freeman, the county attorney, said he expected to bring more charges in the case but offered no further details.
A stronger murder charge would have required a motive for Floyd’s death.
Richard Frase, a professor of criminal law at the University of Minnesota, said it was reasonable for prosecutors to charge Chauvin with third-degree murder, as opposed to a more severe form of murder, which would require proving that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd.
Frase said the case against Chauvin appeared to be even stronger than the one that Hennepin County prosecutors brought against Mohamed Noor, a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Justine Ruszczyk in 2017.
Noor was charged with the same combination of crimes, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and was convicted of both.
In that case, Frase said, the officer had seemingly panicked and fired a single shot. “There’s a question of whether he even had time to be reckless,” he said, referring to Noor. “Here, there’s eight minutes.”
The criminal complaint against Chauvin, Frase said, did not identify any specific motive for officers to kill Floyd, which he said essentially ruled out first or second-degree murder unless additional evidence surfaced.
Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing Floyd’s family, released a statement Friday calling the arrest of Chauvin “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.” But he said the charges did not go far enough.
“We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” said the statement, which was attributed to Floyd’s family and to Crump.
“The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America,” the statement said.
Frase said he expected Chauvin’s lawyers to seize on the preliminary autopsy findings that showed that Floyd had not died of asphyxiation, which could form the basis for an argument that there was no way Chauvin could have expected him to die. But Frase said another common strategy used by police officers facing charges of brutality — arguing that they were in harm’s way — may be unlikely to convince a jury.
“In this case, there was nobody but Mr. Floyd in danger,” he said. “And there was all that time when it seems there was no need to keep kneeling on his neck like that.”

Full text: A top Democrat said the House would likely weigh a federal chokehold ban as leaders in the House and Senate announced hearings on race and policing.
Top lawmakers in both parties, spurred to action by the death of a black Minnesota man in the custody of white police officers, said on Friday that they would hold hearings in the coming weeks on the use of excessive force by law enforcement and on racial violence.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview that he would convene a hearing in June to consider new federal actions that could help stem racial violence, especially acts of brutality by law enforcement against black and brown Americans. He also said his committee was looking at a federal chokehold ban and legislation to establish a commission to study the social status of black men and boys.
"What we are going to look at very specifically is where and under what circumstances the federal government can step in when local governments are engaging in or not stopping or controlling violence against racial minorities," Mr. Nadler said.
In the Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of that chamber's Judiciary Committee, said he would seek testimony on proposals to improve policing, combat "racial discrimination regarding the use of force" and improve relations between police departments and the communities they serve. He described the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in an episode captured on video, as "horrific."
Mr. Graham said both he and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the panel, were "appalled at what we saw and believe it is important to have a hearing as soon as possible as to how to combat this outrage."
"We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death," he said in a statement, "with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation."
The swift response on both sides of the Capitol reflected the interest by lawmakers in both parties to respond to a rash of killings of black Americans by white civilians and police officers this year, which have inspired protests across the country. But Democrats appeared to be moving more aggressively to advance specific legislative proposals aimed at forcing the Trump administration to mount a stronger response.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Friday that the officers involved in the Minneapolis case "look pretty darn guilty," and he called the death of Mr. Floyd "a hideous crime." But he condemned violent protests across the country, and said that Americans should trust that the criminal justice system would hold those involved accountable.
Mr. McConnell also declined to comment on tweets by President Trump earlier Friday, suggesting that federal authorities would violently intervene if protesters in Minneapolis were not peaceful.
"I can speak for myself, I think what's happening in Louisville and in Minneapolis really needs to stop," Mr. McConnell said. "This senseless violence and reaction to this is not helpful. But you can certainly understand the outrage -- you can certainly understand the outrage."
Mr. Nadler's comments came a day after he and the 23 other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department calling on officials there to open investigations related to the recent deaths of Mr. Floyd, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.
"In terms of maintaining social peace in this country, it is imperative that we move ahead quickly," Mr. Nadler said.
Mr. Floyd died this week in police custody after a white Minneapolis officer handcuffed him and pinned him to the ground with his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck. Ms. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was fatally shot by the police in March during a narcotics raid in her home in Louisville, Ky. Mr. Arbery was jogging in Georgia this year when he was chased and fatally shot by two white men who had ties to the local authorities and were not initially charged in the case.
Many of the proposals being considered by Democrats have been discussed for years with little movement. Watching the growing national outcry in recent days, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats would pursue "action so that this stops," rather than just offering "expressions of concern."
"We saw a murder take place before our very eyes," she said on Thursday. "And so, the fact that the police officers were fired, that's one thing, but there has to be some justice in all of this."
In addition to drafting new legislation, Mr. Nadler said he was looking at a bill introduced by Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York that would place a federal ban on the use of chokeholds or any pressure to the neck by the police.
Mr. Jeffries, who represents Brooklyn, initially introduced the legislation in 2015 after the death of Eric Garner by police chokehold, and it would have made the tactic used by the officer in Mr. Floyd's case illegal. In videos of the episodes, Mr. Garner and Mr. Floyd could both be heard saying "I can't breathe" in the moments before their deaths.
The committee is also likely to take up the bill establishing a commission that would be tasked with investigating racial disparities in education, criminal justice, health and employment and recommending policy changes. Sponsored by Representative Frederica Wilson, Democrat of Florida, the bill has also been put forward in the Senate by Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida; Kamala Harris, Democrat of California; and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.
Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an interview on Friday that she was still looking to develop other proposals to address state laws that protect officers who use force when they say they feel threatened.
"This stuff is happening so fast," she said, "we literally have not had a chance to have that conversation."
Ms. Bass is among a group of prominent progressive lawmakers who are pressing for a vote on a separate, nonbinding resolution they introduced on Friday "condemning all acts of police brutality, racial profiling, and the use of excessive and militarized force throughout the country." It calls on law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local levels to commit to reforms.
"There can be no justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, or any of the human beings who have been killed by law enforcement," Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the measure, wrote on Twitter. "For in a just world, they would still be alive. There must, however, be accountability."

Chanting “Hands up! Don’t shoot,” and “I can’t breathe,” thousands of protesters gathered in cities across the country Friday night after a fired Minneapolis police officer was charged with third-degree murder in the death of George Floyd.
As unrest following Floyd’s death gave way to the fourth night of demonstrations, crowds shut down Los Angeles freeways, clashed with police in Dallas and looted stores in Minneapolis. Even as a curfew was taking effect in Minneapolis, protesters were defying it, gathering in the streets around the police station that was burned a night earlier.
They chanted, “No justice, no peace, prosecute the police!”
In Atlanta, which saw some of the country’s biggest protests, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms declared, “This is not how we change America.” Demonstrators in many other cities, including New York, also gathered to voice their anger after Floyd’s death:
— A large crowd in Washington chanted outside the White House, prompting the Secret Service to temporarily lock down the building. Video on social media showed demonstrators knocking down barricades and spray-painting other buildings.
— A march in Houston, where Floyd grew up, briefly turned chaotic as the windows of a police SUV were smashed and at least 12 protesters were arrested. As a standoff continued, the police shut all roads into and out of downtown. “We don’t want these young people’s legitimate grievances and legitimate concerns to be overshadowed by a handful of provocateurs and anarchists,” the city’s police chief, Art Acevedo, said in an interview.
— Images from news helicopters above San Jose, California, showed protesters throwing objects at police officers, blocking a major freeway and setting fires downtown. Mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview that he watched from City Hall as a peaceful protest — what he called people “expressing their righteous outrage on the injustice in Minneapolis” — turned violent.
— “Black is not a crime,” declared a small crowd gathered outside police headquarters in Detroit . Mary Sheffield, a member of the City Council, led a chant, proclaiming, “I’m fired up. I’m fed up.” The demonstration later swelled to more than 1,000 protesters, who blocked traffic while marching on major thoroughfares leading downtown.
— In downtown Dallas , protesters and the police clashed during a demonstration blocks from City Hall. Protesters blocked the path of a police vehicle and then started banging on its hood. Officers eventually responded with tear gas, and a flash-bang was later heard.
— Hundreds of protesters converged on Civic Center Park in Denver , waving signs and chanting as Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” played over a loudspeaker. Some thrust fists in the air and scrawled messages on the ground in chalk, according to a news broadcast.
— Protesters in Milwaukee briefly shut down part of a major highway, according to WTMJ-TV, and demonstrators shouted “I can’t breathe” — echoing Floyd’s anguished plea and the words of Eric Garner, a black man who died in New York police custody in 2014.
— Police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, were filmed firing what appeared to be pepper spray balls at several hundred demonstrators protesting the police killing of Breonna Taylor. “I’m getting shot! I’m getting shot!” screamed a WAVE 3 News reporter, Kaitlin Rust, who was holding a microphone and wearing a yellow safety vest.
Fired officer is charged with third-degree murder after Floyd’s death.
The former police officer who was seen on video using his knee to pin down Floyd, who was black, has been arrested and charged with murder, authorities announced Friday, after days of growing unrest in Minneapolis escalated with the burning of a police station and protests that drew attention from the White House.
The former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, was arrested by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on Friday, authorities said. Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, announced Friday afternoon.
Floyd’s relatives said in a statement that they were disappointed by the decision not to seek first-degree murder charges.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.” Charges of first- and second-degree murder require prosecutors to prove, in almost all cases, that the perpetrator made a decision to kill the victim.
Chauvin was also charged with second-degree manslaughter, a charge that requires prosecutors to prove he was so negligent as to create an “unreasonable risk,” and consciously took the chance that his actions would cause Floyd to be severely harmed or die.
An investigation into the other three officers who were present at the scene Monday was ongoing, Freeman said.
The developments came after a night of chaos in which protesters set fire to a police station in Minneapolis, the National Guard was deployed to help restore order, and President Donald Trump injected himself into the mix with tweets that appeared to threaten violence against protesters.
The tensions in Minneapolis reflected a growing frustration around the country as demonstrators took to the streets to protest the death of Floyd and other recent killings of black men and women.
Floyd, 46, died Monday after pleading “I can’t breathe” while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck, in an encounter that was captured on video.
Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a Democrat, expressed solidarity with the protesters during a news conference Friday but said that a return to order was needed to lift up the voices of “those who are expressing rage and anger and those who are demanding justice” and “not those who throw firebombs.”
Trump, who previously called the video of Floyd’s death “shocking,” drew criticism for a tweet early Friday that called the protesters “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The comments prompted Twitter to attach a warning to the tweet, saying that it violated the company’s rules about “glorifying violence.”
The president gave his first extensive remarks on the protests later Friday at the White House, declaring that “we can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos. It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody, that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory.”
Addressing his earlier Twitter comments, Trump said, “The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters. They hurt so badly what is happening.”
The spectacle of a police station in flames and a president appearing to threaten violence against those protesting the death of a black man in police custody, set against the backdrop of a coronavirus pandemic that has kept many people from engaging with one another directly for months, added to the anxiety of a nation already plagued by crises.
The protests — some peaceful, some marked by violence — have spread across the country, from Denver and Phoenix to Louisville, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio, with more expected Friday night.
Minneapolis is under a curfew Friday night, with the National Guard on the streets.
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis imposed an 8 p.m. curfew to try to stem the escalating violence that has engulfed the city for the last three nights.
The curfew will extend through the weekend, according to the mayor’s order, expiring at 6 a.m. each morning. During the hours of the curfew, people are prohibited from traveling on public streets or gathering in a public place.
But even as the curfew was taking effect on Friday evening, protesters were defying it, gathering in the streets around the police station that was burned a night earlier.
They chanted, “No justice, no peace, prosecute the police!”
Law enforcement officials fired tear gas into the streets and patrolled in military vehicles.
Late into the night Friday, several hundred demonstrators continued to chant near a police station, and people were reportedly taking goods from an office products store.
Walz, who activated the National Guard on Thursday as local police appeared to lose control over angry demonstrators, also extended the curfew to St. Paul and said guardsmen would return to the streets in anticipation of more protests.
In the unrest Thursday night, more than 160 buildings were destroyed, damaged or looted, the Star Tribune reported. Nearly all businesses in the Seward neighborhood of Minneapolis were shut Friday, many protected with plywood.
During a 90-minute news conference Friday, the governor said that officials should have anticipated that the protests could become violent, but he said it was unrealistic to expect law enforcement to stop people from coming out to demonstrate, even amid the social distancing orders that have been imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Watching what happened to George Floyd had people say, ‘To hell with staying home,’” he said. “The idea that we would go in and break up those expressions of grief and rage was ridiculous.”
Camille Gage, 63, an artist and musician who joined the protests, said she was relieved that Chauvin had been charged. “How can anyone watch that video and think it was anything less?” she said. “Such blatant disregard for another living soul.”
Kelsey Lindell, 27, an executive producer for a local film company, said all four officers at the scene of the incident should be arrested, charged and punished for murder. “I want to see a higher charge for all the officers,” she said, “but the biggest thing for me is that this guy gets jail time.”
Walz acknowledged that the Minneapolis police had lost the trust of city residents, but he implored residents to see the National Guard as a peacekeeping force meant to keep “anarchists” from taking over and destroying more of the city.
“I need to ask Minnesotans, those in pain and those who feel like justice has not been served yet, you need to help us create the space so that justice will be served,” the governor said. “It is my expectation that it will be swift.”
Days of protests had intensified Thursday night when the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct station house was overrun by a crowd of protesters, with some people tossing fireworks and other items at officers, while police fired projectiles back.
Officers retreated in vehicles just after 10 p.m. Thursday as protesters stormed the building — smashing equipment, lighting fires and setting off fireworks, according to videos posted from the scene.
Frey said at a news conference Friday morning that he had made the call for officers to flee the 3rd Precinct, saying, “The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life.”
Frey, a Democrat, said he understood the anger of the city’s residents but pleaded with people to stop destroying property and looting stores.
“It’s not just enough to do the right thing yourself,” he said. “We need to be making sure that all of us are held accountable.”
John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said that arrests had been made related to looting Thursday night but that he did not know how many. The arrests included people breaking into the grocery stores, Targets and pharmacies, he said.
Protesters and officers trade projectiles outside Barclays Center in New York.
Tensions flared in New York for the second night in a row as thousands of protesters stormed the perimeter of Barclays Center in Brooklyn, trading projectiles of plastic water bottles, debris, and tear gas and mace with police officers.
The protest had begun peacefully Friday afternoon, with hundreds chanting, “Black lives matter,” and, “We want justice,” in downtown Manhattan. But the demonstrations took a turn in Brooklyn, where officers made between 50 and 100 arrests, a senior police official said.
Police officers with twist-tie handcuffs hanging from their belts stood next to Department of Corrections buses and squad cars with lights flashing, encircling the perimeter. A police helicopter and a large drone whirred in the hot air overhead.
Protesters were later seen throwing water bottles, an umbrella and other objects at officers, who responded by shooting tear gas into the crowd.
As that crowd scattered, protesters gathered in the streets in the nearby Fort Greene neighborhood, continuing to chant at the police. An empty patrol van was set ablaze, then pillaged, as people pried the doors off the hinges. Fireworks were thrown into the burned shell of the vehicle. Scribbled on the hood was the phrase “dead cops.”
By 10 p.m., riot police had descended on the neighborhood. Another police official had described the scene in parts of the borough as “out of control.”
Earlier in the evening, several hundred people filled Foley Square near the city’s criminal courthouses. After a man in a green sweatshirt crossed a police barricade, he was swarmed by officers while protesters screamed. He was led away on foot in handcuffs.
“It was kind of his mistake,” said Jason Phillips, 27, of Queens. “But they were trying to push him back, and as they pushed him back, he slipped, and they took that as some type of threat.”
Despite the frustrations of demonstrators Friday, police said the number of people detained was much smaller than the night before, when 72 people were arrested.
Floyd was pinned for minutes while unresponsive, prosecutors said.
In a probable cause affidavit released Friday after the charges against Chauvin were filed, prosecutors said that the former officer held his knee to Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. “Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive,” the affidavit said.
But preliminary results from an autopsy indicated that Floyd did not die from suffocation or strangulation, prosecutors wrote, and that “the combined effects” of an underlying heart condition, any potential intoxicants and the police restraint likely contributed to his death. He also began complaining that he could not breathe before he was pinned down, the affidavit said.
The officers’ body cameras were running throughout the encounter, prosecutors said.
Four officers responded to a report at about 8 p.m. Monday about a man suspected of making a purchase from a store with a fake $20 bill, prosecutors said. After learning that the man was parked near the store, the first two responding officers, who did not include Chauvin, approached Floyd, a former high school sports star who worked as a bouncer at a restaurant in Minneapolis.
Floyd, who was in a car with two other people, was ordered out and arrested. But when the officers began to move him toward a squad car, he stiffened and resisted, according to the affidavit. While still standing, Floyd began to say he could not breathe, the affidavit said.
That was when Chauvin, who was among two other officers who arrived at the scene, got involved, prosecutors said. Around 8:19 p.m., Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the squad car and placed his knee onto Floyd’s neck area, holding him down on the ground while another officer held his legs. At times, Floyd pleaded, the affidavit said, saying, “I can’t breathe,” “please” and “mama.”
“You are talking fine,” the officers said, according to the affidavit, as Floyd wrestled on the ground.
At 8:24 p.m., Floyd went still, prosecutors said. A minute later, one of the other officers checked his wrist for a pulse but could not find one. Chauvin continued to hold his knee down on Floyd’s neck until 8:27, according to the affidavit.
The other officers, who have been identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, are under investigation. Freeman, the county attorney, said he expected to bring more charges in the case but offered no further details.
A stronger murder charge would have required a motive for Floyd’s death.
Richard Frase, a professor of criminal law at the University of Minnesota, said it was reasonable for prosecutors to charge Chauvin with third-degree murder, as opposed to a more severe form of murder, which would require proving that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd.
Frase said the case against Chauvin appeared to be even stronger than the one that Hennepin County prosecutors brought against Mohamed Noor, a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Justine Ruszczyk in 2017.
Noor was charged with the same combination of crimes, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and was convicted of both.
In that case, Frase said, the officer had seemingly panicked and fired a single shot. “There’s a question of whether he even had time to be reckless,” he said, referring to Noor. “Here, there’s eight minutes.”
The criminal complaint against Chauvin, Frase said, did not identify any specific motive for officers to kill Floyd, which he said essentially ruled out first or second-degree murder unless additional evidence surfaced.
Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing Floyd’s family, released a statement Friday calling the arrest of Chauvin “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.” But he said the charges did not go far enough.
“We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” said the statement, which was attributed to Floyd’s family and to Crump.
“The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America,” the statement said.
Frase said he expected Chauvin’s lawyers to seize on the preliminary autopsy findings that showed that Floyd had not died of asphyxiation, which could form the basis for an argument that there was no way Chauvin could have expected him to die. But Frase said another common strategy used by police officers facing charges of brutality — arguing that they were in harm’s way — may be unlikely to convince a jury.
“In this case, there was nobody but Mr. Floyd in danger,” he said. “And there was all that time when it seems there was no need to keep kneeling on his neck like that.”
A government drone in the skies over Minneapolis stokes civil liberties concerns.
A Predator drone operated by the federal Customs and Border Protection agency flew a surveillance mission over Minneapolis on Friday morning as the city reeled from days of escalating violence, stoking suspicion and prompting criticism from civil liberties groups.
An agency spokesman said in a statement that the unmanned aircraft “was preparing to provide live video to aid in situational awareness at the request of our federal law enforcement partners in Minneapolis.”
But after more than an hour flying in a holding pattern at 20,000 feet over the city, according to publicly available flight data, the drone returned to its base in North Dakota. “The requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed,” the statement said.
The drone was spotted on an online flight-tracking tool and was earlier reported by Jason Paladino of the Project on Government Oversight.
In recent years, U.S. government agencies have used surveillance aircraft to monitor protests in American cities. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is suing the Baltimore Police Department to block its surveillance plane program, called on Friday for Customs and Border Protection to immediately halt the use of its drone over Minneapolis.
“This rogue agency’s use of military technology to surveil protesters inside U.S. borders is deeply disturbing,” Neema Singh Guliani, a lawyer for the group, said in a statement.
Obama and Biden addressed Floyd’s death.
Former President Barack Obama on Friday called on the nation to work together to create a “new normal” in which bigotry no longer infects institutions, while former Vice President Joe Biden used a short speech to call for “justice for George Floyd.”
In a statement posted to Twitter, Obama said, “It’s natural to wish for life ‘to just get back to normal’ as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us.” But for millions of Americans, being treated differently because of race is “normal,” Obama said, referencing two other recent cases: Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed after two men confronted him while he was running in south Georgia, and Christian Cooper, who was bird watching in Central Park when a woman called police to say she was being threatened.
“This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” Obama said, adding: “It falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station, to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who has risen on the national political stage for his coronavirus response, spoke up in defense of the protesters in Minnesota.
“I stand figuratively with the protesters,” he said Friday. “I stand against the arson and the burglary and the criminality, and I think all well-meaning Americans stand with the protesters. Enough is enough.”

Top lawmakers in both parties, spurred to action by the death of a black Minnesota man in the custody of white police officers, said Friday that they would hold hearings in the coming weeks on the use of excessive force by law enforcement and on racial violence.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview that he would convene a hearing in June to consider new federal actions that could help stem racial violence, especially acts of brutality by law enforcement against black and brown Americans. He also said his committee was looking at a federal chokehold ban and legislation to establish a commission to study the social status of black men and boys.
“What we are going to look at very specifically is where and under what circumstances the federal government can step in when local governments are engaging in or not stopping or controlling violence against racial minorities,” Nadler said.
In the Senate, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of that chamber’s Judiciary Committee, said he would seek testimony on proposals to improve policing, combat “racial discrimination regarding the use of force” and improve relations between police departments and the communities they serve. He described the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in an episode captured on video, as “horrific.”
Graham said both he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the panel, were “appalled at what we saw and believe it is important to have a hearing as soon as possible as to how to combat this outrage.”
“We intend to shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd’s death,” he said in a statement, “with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation.”
The swift response on both sides of the Capitol reflected the interest by lawmakers in both parties to respond to a rash of killings of black Americans by white civilians and police officers this year, which have inspired protests across the country. But Democrats appeared to be moving more aggressively to advance specific legislative proposals aimed at forcing the Trump administration to mount a stronger response.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, said Friday that the officers involved in the Minneapolis case “look pretty darn guilty,” and he called the death of Floyd “a hideous crime.” But he condemned violent protests across the country, and said that Americans should trust that the criminal justice system would hold those involved accountable.
McConnell also declined to comment on tweets by President Donald Trump earlier Friday, suggesting that federal authorities would violently intervene if protesters in Minneapolis were not peaceful.
“I can speak for myself, I think what’s happening in Louisville and in Minneapolis really needs to stop,” McConnell said. “This senseless violence and reaction to this is not helpful. But you can certainly understand the outrage — you can certainly understand the outrage.”
Nadler’s comments came a day after he and the 23 other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department calling on officials there to open investigations related to the recent deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia.
“In terms of maintaining social peace in this country, it is imperative that we move ahead quickly,” Nadler said.
Floyd died this week in police custody after a white Minneapolis officer handcuffed him and pinned him to the ground with his knee on Floyd’s neck. Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was fatally shot by the police in March during a narcotics raid in her home in Louisville, Kentucky. Arbery was jogging in Georgia this year when he was chased and fatally shot by two white men who had ties to local authorities and were not initially charged in the case.
Many of the proposals being considered by Democrats have been discussed for years with little movement. Watching the growing national outcry in recent days, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats would pursue “action so that this stops,” rather than just offering “expressions of concern.”
“We saw a murder take place before our very eyes,” she said Thursday. “And so, the fact that the police officers were fired, that’s one thing, but there has to be some justice in all of this.”
In addition to drafting new legislation, Nadler said he was looking at a bill introduced by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that would place a federal ban on the use of chokeholds or any pressure to the neck by the police.
Jeffries, who represents Brooklyn, initially introduced the legislation in 2015 after the death of Eric Garner by police chokehold, and it would have made the tactic used by the officer in Floyd’s case illegal. In videos of the episodes, Garner and Floyd could both be heard saying “I can’t breathe” in the moments before their deaths.
The committee is also likely to take up the bill establishing a commission that would be tasked with investigating racial disparities in education, criminal justice, health and employment and recommending policy changes. Sponsored by Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., the bill has also been put forward in the Senate by Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; and Cory Booker, D-N.J.
Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an interview Friday that she was still looking to develop other proposals to address state laws that protect officers who use force when they say they feel threatened.
“This stuff is happening so fast,” she said, “we literally have not had a chance to have that conversation.”
Bass is among a group of prominent progressive lawmakers who are pressing for a vote on a separate, nonbinding resolution they introduced Friday “condemning all acts of police brutality, racial profiling, and the use of excessive and militarized force throughout the country.” It calls on law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local levels to commit to reforms.
“There can be no justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, or any of the human beings who have been killed by law enforcement,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., a sponsor of the measure, wrote on Twitter. “For in a just world, they would still be alive. There must, however, be accountability.”

A Justice Dept. Skeptical of Police Abuse Cases Vows to Investigate Floyd Death [With graphic(s)]

WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr on Friday labeled the images of the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who a white police officer knelt on for nearly nine minutes, as “harrowing” and “deeply disturbing” and vowed that the federal investigation into his death would proceed quickly.
“I am confident justice will be served,” Barr said in a statement as protesters across the country condemned the actions of the officer, Derek Chauvin, who was charged Friday by local authorities with third-degree murder and manslaughter.
But the Trump administration’s years of inaction on police violence and President Donald Trump’s embrace of law enforcement have made civil rights advocates wary of the Justice Department’s involvement in the Floyd case. The administration has largely dismantled police oversight efforts, curbing the use of federal consent decrees to overhaul local police departments. Barr has said that communities that criticize law enforcement may not deserve police protection, and Trump has encouraged officers not to be “too nice” in handling suspects.
Advocates for police overhaul said in interviews Friday that they were in a difficult position: After denouncing the federal government’s retreat from police accountability — and civil rights enforcement more broadly — they are now wary of its intentions.
“Our confidence in a federal intervention in cases like this is wholly dependent on the track record of the administration that is stepping in,” said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP. “This administration lacks credibility when it comes to addressing issues of justice, fairness and race.”
Barr said that any federal charges would be “based on the law and facts,” and that they would not come until after local charging decisions.
To bring federal civil rights charges in the Floyd case, prosecutors have to meet a difficult bar: proving that Chauvin intended to violate Floyd’s civil rights and acted on that wish, Johnson said. Prosecutors are often reluctant to bring such cases because they are so difficult to win.
“We are confronted with the stark reality this family may not see justice, even with the prevailing evidence in broad daylight from multiple camera views that there was no resisting, no physical provocation, that he was subdued and cuffed, that he said he can’t breathe, and that blood was coming out of his mouth,” Johnson said.
Barr’s announcement suggested no broader investigation into possible abuses in the Minneapolis Police Department, a move that local activists have demanded. Congressional Democrats also asked the Justice Department this week to open an investigation into the police. The city has a history of accusations of police abuse, and in 2017, an officer in a Minneapolis suburb was found not guilty of manslaughter in the death of Philando Castile, a black motorist.
Under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department aggressively sought to combat excessive use of force by the police. The department and local police departments signed 14 consent decrees, court-enforced agreements detailing remedies like additional police training or data collection.
The Justice Department under Obama most likely “would have looked at Minneapolis given the pattern of problems that were apparent,” said Jonathan Smith, a former department official who negotiated several of the decrees.
Justice Department findings typically prompted the consent agreements. Police in Ferguson, Missouri, where the fatal shooting in 2014 of an unarmed black teenager by a white officer set off a national debate over the use of police force, fined and arrested African Americans in part to balance the city’s budget, the department found. It concluded that Baltimore police were more concerned with accumulating statistics than reducing violent crime.
Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, moved to rein Justice Department efforts to investigate patterns of allegations of misconduct by local police.
Shortly after taking office, he ordered a broad review of consent decrees. On the day he was fired in 2018, Sessions sharply limited their use altogether.
The department under Trump has entered into consent decrees with police in Ville Platte and the sheriff’s office in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, based on an investigation opened in 2015, and opened a pattern-and-practice investigation into police in Springfield, Massachusetts. It has also pursued abuses in prison systems in Alabama and New Jersey.
But critics said that the department’s overall approach did little to address allegations of police misconduct.
“They’ve just really been dismissive about the fact that police abuse happens, and the fact that it’s a problem the federal government can and should do something about,” said Christy E. Lopez, a former deputy chief in the special litigation section of the civil rights division during the Obama administration.
She pointed to comments that Trump made in 2017 to the police on Long Island, New York, suggesting that they should not protect the heads of suspects ushered into police cars. At the time, police departments around the country distanced themselves from the president’s position.
“It’s been the tenor of this entire administration and of the DOJ,” Lopez said. “That absolutely sends a message to police officers on the street.”
Sessions repeatedly argued that criticism of the police or excessive oversight could damage the morale of officers, harming their ability to control crime. Barr, in his own public comments, has stressed that abuses reflect “bad apples” more than systemic breakdowns.
Minority communities have long criticized Barr’s full-throated support of law enforcement, beginning with his first stint as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, when he advocated on behalf of maximum sentencing laws that laid the groundwork for high rates of incarceration among black people.
Civil rights groups, including the NAACP, opposed his confirmation last year. During his confirmation hearing, Barr defended his record but said that such a strict approach on sentencing was now unnecessary.
Critics wary of the Justice Department’s intervention in the Floyd case also pointed to statements Barr made over the past year in which he backed police and cast protesters as endangering public safety.
He warned in December that critics of the police risked losing law enforcement protection, saying, “If communities don’t give that support and respect, they may find themselves without the police protection they need.” And he said last summer that officers were unfairly scrutinized when people resisted arrest while the fact that suspects who resisted arrest, endangering themselves and the police, “frequently goes without mention.”
“The cynicism that people have is well-grounded,” said David Rudovsky, a civil rights lawyer in Philadelphia and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who has long worked on police accountability cases.
The burden in the Floyd case is on law enforcement “to show that they can actually do a credible investigation,” he said.
Barr’s defenders pointed to his first stint as attorney general, when the acquittals of four white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney King, incited protests and riots in Los Angeles and across the country.
The Justice Department intervened, charging the officers with violating King’s civil rights. Federal prosecutors secured guilty verdicts against two of the officers, and many civil rights advocates said that the federal government had helped secure justice for King.
“Bill did take a very personal interest in the case,” said George Terwilliger, Barr’s top deputy at the time. “The damage that can be done to law enforcement interests when officers engage in criminal acts can’t be underestimated.”
Terwilliger said that every attorney general should have a record of solid support for police, “but that doesn’t mean that when law enforcement authority is abused, that you’re going to lay down.”
Floyd’s death has echoes of the death of Eric Garner, who died after an officer on Staten Island, New York, wrapped his arm around Garner’s neck. The encounter was captured on video and Garner’s dying words of “I can’t breathe” became a rallying cry for demonstrations.
A local grand jury voted not to indict the officer, Daniel Pantaleo, and the Justice Department declined to charge him after a five-year investigation, saying it could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had willingly and knowingly violated Garner’s civil rights. The New York Police Department ultimately dismissed Pantaleo over his use of an illegal chokehold on Garner.

En el video del celular que registró la muerte de George Floyd, el oficial que lo arrestó, Derek Chauvin, mantuvo la rodilla presionada contra la parte posterior del cuello de Floyd durante unos ocho minutos hasta que dejó de hablar o moverse.
“Usted no tiene que inclinarse así con la rodilla en su cuello”, exclamó un espectador fuera de cámara, dirigiéndose al oficial con un lenguaje aderezado de improperios. “Él está disfrutando eso. Lo estás disfrutando. Ya podrías haberlo metido en el coche”.
Para los entrenadores de los cuerpos policiacos y criminólogos, el episodio ejemplifica por qué muchos departamentos de policía de todo Estados Unidos han tratado de prohibir o al menos limitar el uso de estrangulamientos u otras maniobras en el cuello de las personas en los últimos años: con frecuencia esas prácticas han ocasionado muertes de alto perfil mediático.
“Es una técnica que ya no usamos tanto debido a la vulnerabilidad”, dijo Mylan Masson, una exoficial de policía que dirigió un programa de capacitación para la policía de Minneapolis durante 15 años hasta 2016. “Tratamos de mantenernos alejados del cuello, en la medida de lo posible”.
Aún no se han divulgado todos los detalles de lo sucedido, en particular lo que las cámaras de la policía podrían mostrar sobre el altercado entre Floyd y Chauvin, de 44 años, un oficial experimentado que trabajó durante 19 años en el Departamento de Policía y que fue despedido después del suceso. Sin embargo, los registros oficiales indican que la policía de Minneapolis no ha abandonado por completo el uso de las maniobras de dominación del cuello, aunque se ha dicho que el método usado por Chauvin ya no forma parte del entrenamiento policial.
El manual del Departamento de Policía de Minneapolis establece que las restricciones de cuello y los estrangulamientos solo pueden aplicarse cuando un oficial se encuentra en una situación de vida o muerte. Aparentemente, la detención de Floyd no produjo una situación de esa naturaleza.
Los expertos que han visto las imágenes sugieren que probablemente sea un caso de “justicia callejera”, lo que sucede cuando un oficial de policía busca castigar a un sospechoso infligiéndole dolor porque durante el arresto le hizo algo.
Los criminólogos que vieron el video dijeron que el uso de la rodilla no solo ejercía una presión peligrosa sobre la parte posterior del cuello, sino que también mantuvo a Floyd acostado boca abajo durante demasiado tiempo. Ambas posiciones —la rodilla en el cuello y mantener boca abajo a una persona— entrañan el riesgo de cortar el suministro de oxígeno.
“Mantener a Floyd boca abajo con las manos esposadas y en la espalda es lo que probablemente lo mató”, dijo Seth Stoughton, un exoficial de policía que es profesor de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de Carolina del Sur. El entrenamiento policial comenzó a evitar esa maniobra hace unos 20 años, dijo.
En cuanto a los estrangulamientos, los departamentos que todavía los permiten generalmente usan una especie de maniobra de lucha libre en la que el oficial pone su brazo alrededor del cuello de la otra persona y aplica presión, afirmó Stoughton. La idea es someter a los sospechosos de la manera más rápida posible para meterlos en la patrulla, no deben permanecer en esa posición posiblemente mortal durante tantos minutos como sucedió con Floyd.
Además, usar la rodilla sobre la parte posterior del cuello en vez de ponerla hacia los lados implica el riesgo de matar o herir gravemente a alguien porque se corta el suministro de aire o se puede dañar la columna cervical y otros huesos delicados del cuello, dijo Stoughton. Ningún departamento permite el uso de esa técnica en circunstancias normales, aseguraron los expertos.
El manual de la policía de Minneapolis llama al estrangulamiento una “opción de fuerza letal” y las maniobras sobre el cuello, una “opción de fuerza no letal”. Las maniobras sobre el cuello implican comprimir uno o ambos lados del cuello de una persona con un brazo o una pierna sin cortar el flujo del aire a través de la tráquea. Un estrangulamiento está destinado a cortar el suministro de aire de alguien si el oficial siente que su vida está amenazada, dice el manual.
El manual explica además que hacer una restricción consciente en el cuello puede usarse contra un sujeto que está “resistiendo activamente”, mientras que dejar a la persona inconsciente debe limitarse a alguien que sea agresivo o “con el propósito de salvar vidas”.
John Elder, portavoz del Departamento de Policía de Minneapolis, no respondió a la pregunta sobre si la restricción de rodilla usada por Chauvin correspondía a esas pautas.
Muchos departamentos de policía, incluido el de Minneapolis, dejaron de enseñar la técnica de restricción con rodilla y también trataron de limitar el uso de estrangulamientos después de la muerte de Eric Garner, a manos del Departamento de Policía de Nueva York en 2014, que tuvo una amplia cobertura mediática.
Garner jadeó “no puedo respirar” once veces mientras estaba acostado boca abajo en la acera, una oración que Floyd dijo también varias veces. En el caso de Garner, los investigadores determinaron que el oficial que lo lanzó al suelo estaba usando una técnica prohibida de estrangulamiento.
El médico forense dictaminó que la muerte de Garner fue un homicidio causado por la compresión de su cuello por un “estrangulamiento” y la comprensión de su pecho contra el suelo en una posición boca abajo. El oficial Daniel Pantaleo, quien estranguló a Garner, fue despedido pero no acusado, lo que incitó a protestas en todo el país.
Masson afirma que el curso de capacitación para las fuerzas de seguridad que dirigía en el Hennepin Technical College de Minneapolis dejó de enseñar la técnica de restricción con rodilla a los aspirantes alrededor de 2014, después del caso Garner, y los oficiales veteranos también deberían haber recibido instrucciones para dejar de aplicarla.
También dijo que a los estudiantes que cursan el programa obligatorio de dos años para todos los que aspiran a entrar al Departamento de Policía se les enseñó cómo aplicar presión en la parte superior de la espalda. “Tan pronto como desaparece la amenaza, detienes el uso de la fuerza”, dijo.
Sin embargo, los documentos del departamento muestran que las técnicas de restricción se han seguido utilizando en Minneapolis, aunque a veces se les llama con nombres diferentes. En 2012, hubo 79 y en 2013, se usó en 69 casos. Para 2018, las cifras cayeron a 40, pero volvieron a subir el año pasado, cuando esa maniobra fue usada en 56 situaciones. Según los registros, la técnica se utilizó mucho más en contra de afroestadounidenses que en contra de personas de otras razas.
Carl Takei, un importante abogado de la Unión Estadounidense por las Libertades Civiles (ACLU, por su sigla en inglés) que se enfoca en las prácticas policiales, dijo que los departamentos que todavía permitían los estrangulamientos intentan diferenciar entre cortar el flujo de sangre, lo que deja a alguien inconsciente, y cortar el flujo de oxígeno, que es mortal.
“Existe un riesgo significativo de que al intentar cortar el flujo de sangre también se interrumpa el flujo de aire”, dijo Takei y explicó que por esa razón la ACLU se opone a la técnica. “Los estrangulamientos deberían estar prohibidos en todas las situaciones”.
Las técnicas de restricción han llevado a varios oficiales a ser enviados a prisión en todo el país en los últimos años después de ser condenados por usar fuerza excesiva.
El hecho de que Chauvin siguiera presionando cuando Floyd ya no estaba luchando hizo que pareciera un caso de un oficial intentando castigar a un sospechoso por hacer algo que al policía no le gustó, lo que puede incluir resistirse al arresto, escupir o insultar al oficial, dijeron los expertos.
Si se trató de una forma de “justicia callejera”, eso se considera una forma de intimidación contra la que las academias de policía también instruyen. “Es enseñarle a alguien una lección: la próxima vez lo pensarás dos veces sobre lo que haces”, dijo Philip M. Stinson, exoficial de policía que se convirtió en profesor de justicia penal en la Universidad Estatal de Bowling Green.
Andy Skoogman, director ejecutivo de la Asociación de Jefes de Policía de Minnesota, dijo que los 300 miembros del grupo estaban horrorizados por la táctica que el oficial usó en el caso de Floyd y la “falta de empatía” que mostró.
“En pocas palabras: cualquier tipo de técnica de uso de la fuerza debe detenerse cuando se logra el objetivo”, dijo, y agregó que no sabía de ningún departamento de policía del estado que enseñase esa técnica.

The former police officer who was seen on video using his knee to pin down George Floyd, a black man who later died, has been arrested and charged with murder, authorities announced Friday, after days of growing unrest in Minneapolis escalated with the burning of a police station and protests that drew attention from the White House.
The former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, who is white, was arrested by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on Friday, authorities said. Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, announced Friday afternoon.
Floyd’s relatives said in a statement that they were disappointed by the decision not to seek first-degree murder charges.
Third-degree murder does not require an intent to kill, according to the Minnesota statute, only that the perpetrator caused someone’s death in a dangerous act “without regard for human life.” Charges of first- and second-degree murder require prosecutors to prove, in almost all cases, that the perpetrator made a decision to kill the victim.
Chauvin was also charged with second-degree manslaughter, a charge that requires prosecutors to prove he was so negligent as to create an “unreasonable risk,” and consciously took the chance that his actions would cause Floyd to be severely harmed or die.
An investigation into the other three officers who were present at the scene Monday was ongoing, Freeman said.
The developments came after a night of chaos in which protesters set fire to a police station in Minneapolis, the National Guard was deployed to help restore order, and President Donald Trump injected himself into the mix with tweets that appeared to threaten violence against protesters.
The tensions in Minneapolis reflected a growing frustration around the country, as demonstrators took to the streets to protest the death of Floyd and other recent killings of black men and women.
Floyd, 46, died Monday after pleading “I can’t breathe” while Chauvin pressed his knee into his neck, in an encounter that was captured on video.
Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, a Democrat, expressed solidarity with the protesters during a news conference Friday but said that a return to order was needed to lift up the voices of “those who are expressing rage and anger and those who are demanding justice” and “not those who throw firebombs.”
Trump, who previously called the video of Floyd’s death “shocking,” drew criticism for a tweet early Friday that called the protesters “thugs” and said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The comments prompted Twitter to attach a warning to the tweet, saying that it violated the company’s rules about “glorifying violence.”
The president gave his first extensive remarks on the protests later Friday at the White House, declaring that “we can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos. It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody, that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory.”
Addressing his earlier Twitter comments, Trump said, “The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters. They hurt so badly what is happening.”
The spectacle of a police station in flames and a president appearing to threaten violence against those protesting the death of a black man in police custody, set against the backdrop of a coronavirus pandemic that has kept many people from engaging with one another directly for months, added to the anxiety of a nation already plagued by crises.
The protests — some peaceful, some marked by violence — have spread across the country, from Denver and Phoenix to Louisville, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio, with more expected Friday night.
Minneapolis is under a curfew Friday night, with the National Guard on the streets.
Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis imposed an 8 p.m. curfew to try to stem the escalating violence that has engulfed the city for the last three nights.
The curfew will extend through the weekend, according to the mayor’s order, expiring at 6 a.m. each morning. During the hours of the curfew, people are prohibited from traveling on public streets or gathering in a public place.
But even as the curfew was taking effect on Friday evening, protesters were defying it, gathering in the streets around the police station that was burned a night earlier.
They chanted, “No justice, no peace, prosecute the police!”
Law enforcement officials fired tear gas into the streets and patrolled in military vehicles.
Walz, who activated the National Guard on Thursday as local police appeared to lose control over angry demonstrators, also extended the curfew to St. Paul and said guardsmen would return to the streets in anticipation of more protests.
In the unrest on Thursday night, more than 160 buildings were destroyed, damaged or looted, The Star Tribune reported. Nearly all businesses in the Seward neighborhood of Minneapolis were shut on Friday, many protected with plywood.
During a 90-minute news conference Friday, the governor said that officials should have anticipated that the protests could become violent, but he said it was unrealistic to expect law enforcement to stop people from coming out to demonstrate, even amid the social distancing orders that have been imposed during the coronavirus pandemic.
“Watching what happened to George Floyd had people say, ‘To hell with staying home,’” he said. “The idea that we would go in and break up those expressions of grief and rage was ridiculous.”
Camille J. Gage, 63, an artist and musician who joined the protests, said she was relieved that Chauvin had been charged. “How can anyone watch that video and think it was anything less?” she said. “Such blatant disregard for another living soul.”
Kelsey Lindell, 27, an executive producer for a local film company, said all four officers at the scene of the incident should be arrested, charged and punished for murder. “I want to see a higher charge for all the officers,” she said, “but the biggest thing for me is that this guy gets jail time.”
Walz acknowledged that the Minneapolis police had lost the trust of city residents, but he implored residents to see the National Guard as a peacekeeping force meant to keep “anarchists” from taking over and destroying more of the city.
“I need to ask Minnesotans, those in pain and those who feel like justice has not been served yet, you need to help us create the space so that justice will be served,” the governor said. “It is my expectation that it will be swift.”
Days of protests had intensified Thursday night when the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct station house was overrun by a crowd of protesters, with some people tossing fireworks and other items at officers, while police fired projectiles back.
Officers retreated in vehicles just after 10 p.m. Thursday as protesters stormed the building — smashing equipment, lighting fires and setting off fireworks, according to videos posted from the scene.
Frey said at a news conference Friday morning that he had made the call for officers to flee the 3rd Precinct, saying, “The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life.”
Frey, a Democrat, said he understood the anger of the city’s residents but pleaded with people to stop destroying property and looting stores.
“It’s not just enough to do the right thing yourself,” he said. “We need to be making sure that all of us are held accountable.”
John Harrington, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said that arrests had been made related to looting Thursday night but that he did not know how many. The arrests included people breaking into the grocery stores, Targets and pharmacies, he said.
Police cars and CNN sign are vandalized as unrest grows in Atlanta.
A demonstration turned destructive in Atlanta on Friday night, as hundreds of protesters took to the streets, smashing windows and clashing with the police.
They gathered around Centennial Olympic Park, the city’s iconic tourist destination. People jumped on police cars. Some climbed atop a large red CNN sign outside the media company’s headquarters and spray-painted messages on it. Some threw rocks at the glass doors of the Omni Hotel, eventually breaking the glass. Others shattered windows at the College Football Hall of Fame, where people rushed in and emerged with branded fan gear.
Jay Clay, 19, an Atlanta resident and graphic designer, watched the protests from across a street with a mixture of curiosity and solidarity.
“After all this injustice and prejudice, people get fed up,” Clay said. “I wanted to come down and check it out. But this feels like it’s getting out of hand.”
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms pleaded for calm as the demonstrations unfolded.
“It’s enough. You need to go home,” she said. “We are all angry. This hurts. This hurts everybody in this room. But what are you changing by tearing up a city? You’ve lost all credibility now. This is not how we change America. This is not how we change the world.”
Bernice King, the youngest daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also spoke at the news conference, invoking her father’s legacy.
“Violence in fact creates more problems. It is not a solution,” King said. She said she felt and understood the anger of protesters but added, “There are people who would try to incite a race war in this country. Let’s not fall into their hands and into their trap. There’s another way.”
As the protests went on, police officers in riot gear were gathering. By 9:30 p.m., tear gas canisters were launched, and a wave of protesters ran back toward the park.
The White House was briefly locked down as protest spread across the country.
Chanting “Hands up! Don’t shoot,” and “I can’t breathe,” thousands of protesters gathered in cities across the country Friday, the third consecutive day of mass demonstrations after Floyd’s death.
In Washington, a large crowd gathered and chanted outside the White House, prompting the Secret Service to temporarily lock down the building. Video on social media showed demonstrators knocking down barricades, confronting police officers and spray painting other buildings nearby.
In Denver, hundreds of protesters converged on Civic Center Park, waving signs and chanting as Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” played over a loudspeaker. Some thrust fists in the air and scrawled messages on the ground in chalk, according to a live broadcast of the event by ABC News.
Bus and rail service into and out of downtown Denver was suspended in response to the protest Friday and another one planned for Saturday, which is expected to draw more than 10,000 people, according to the Regional Transportation District in Denver.
The agency said it had suspended the service “to ensure the safety of our staff and our riders.”
In Houston, a march in downtown Houston briefly turned chaotic as the windows of a police SUV were smashed and protesters were arrested. At one point, officers holding batons encircled a downtown street as other officers arrested a demonstrator who was on the ground.
In Milwaukee, protesters shouted “I can’t breathe” — echoing Floyd’s anguished plea and the words of Eric Garner, a black man who died in New York Police Department custody in 2014. The protesters briefly shut down part of Interstate 43, a major highway in Milwaukee, according to WTMJ-TV. A Milwaukee police spokeswoman referred questions to the county sheriff’s office, which did not immediately respond to messages.
In Detroit, a small crowd gathered outside police headquarters, declaring, “Black is not a crime.”
Leading the crowd in a chant, Mary Sheffield, a member of the Detroit City Council, proclaimed, “I’m fired up. I’m fed up.” She said what she saw on her television and how the country values black lives is unacceptable.
“To be honest with you, I’m tired of rallying. I’m tired of marching. I’m tired of asking. I’m tired of arguing. I’m just tired,” she said. “We must come to a point where we are demanding now. We are demanding justice.”
Later, the demonstration in Detroit swelled to more than 1,000, as protesters marched on major thoroughfares leading downtown, blocking traffic along the way.
In San Jose, California, protesters marched through that city’s downtown before blocking Highway 101, standing across at least five lanes of traffic, according to NBC News Bay Area.
Protesters and officers trade projectiles outside Barclays Center in New York.
Tensions flared in New York for the second night in a row as thousands of protesters stormed the perimeter of Barclays Center in Brooklyn, trading projectiles of plastic water bottles, debris, and tear gas and mace with police officers.
The protest had begun peacefully Friday afternoon, with hundreds chanting, “Black lives matter,” and, “We want justice,” in downtown Manhattan. But the demonstrations took a turn in Brooklyn.
Police officers with twist-tie handcuffs hanging from their belts stood next to Department of Corrections buses and squad cars with lights flashing, encircling the perimeter. A police helicopter and a large drone whirred in the hot air overhead.
Protesters were later seen throwing water bottles, an umbrella and other objects at officers, who responded by shooting tear gas into the crowd.
Earlier in the evening, several hundred people filled Foley Square near the city’s criminal courthouses. After a man in a green sweatshirt crossed a police barricade, he was swarmed by officers while protesters screamed. He was led away on foot in handcuffs.
“It was kind of his mistake,” said Jason Phillips, 27, of Queens. “But they were trying to push him back, and as they pushed him back, he slipped, and they took that as some type of threat.”
Despite the frustrations of demonstrators Friday, police said the number of people detained was much smaller than the night before, when 72 people were arrested.
Floyd was pinned down for nearly three minutes after he became unresponsive, prosecutors said.
In a probable cause affidavit released Friday after the charges against Chauvin were filed, prosecutors said that the former officer held his knee to Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. “Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive,” the affidavit said.
But preliminary results from an autopsy indicated that Floyd did not die from suffocation or strangulation, prosecutors wrote, and that “the combined effects” of an underlying heart condition, any potential intoxicants and the police restraint likely contributed to his death. He also began complaining that he could not breathe before he was pinned down, the affidavit said.
The officers’ body cameras were running throughout the encounter, prosecutors said.
Four officers responded to a report at about 8 p.m. Monday about a man suspected of making a purchase from a store with a fake $20 bill, prosecutors said. After learning that the man was parked near the store, the first two responding officers, who did not include Chauvin, approached Floyd, a former high school sports star who worked as a bouncer at a restaurant in Minneapolis.
Floyd, who was in a car with two other people, was ordered out and arrested. But when the officers began to move him toward a squad car, he stiffened and resisted, according to the affidavit. While still standing, Floyd began to say he could not breathe, the affidavit said.
That was when Chauvin, who was among two other officers who arrived at the scene, got involved, prosecutors said. Around 8:19 p.m., Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the squad car and placed his knee onto Floyd’s neck area, holding him down on the ground while another officer held his legs. At times, Floyd pleaded, the affidavit said, saying, “I can’t breathe,” “please” and “mama.”
“You are talking fine,” the officers said, according to the affidavit, as Floyd wrestled on the ground.
At 8:24 p.m., Floyd went still, prosecutors said. A minute later, one of the other officers checked his wrist for a pulse but could not find one. Chauvin continued to hold his knee down on Floyd’s neck until 8:27, according to the affidavit.
The other officers, who have been identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, are under investigation. Freeman, the county attorney, said he expected to bring more charges in the case but offered no further details.
Floyd’s family had wanted a more severe charge of first-degree murder.
Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing Floyd’s family, released a statement Friday calling the arrest of Chauvin “a welcome but overdue step on the road to justice.” But he said the charges did not go far enough.
“We expected a first-degree murder charge. We want a first-degree murder charge. And we want to see the other officers arrested,” said the statement, which was attributed to Floyd’s family and to Crump.
“The pain that the black community feels over this murder and what it reflects about the treatment of black people in America is raw and is spilling out onto streets across America,” the statement said.
Crump and the family said they want Minneapolis — and other cities across the country — to fix deficiencies in policies and training that they said permitted Floyd’s death and others like it.
Among the areas they said they want addressed are the use of appropriate, nonlethal restraint techniques, the ability to recognize the medical signs associated with the restriction of airflow, and the legal duty to seek emergency medical care and stop a civil rights violation.
“For four officers to inflict this kind of unnecessary, lethal force — or watch it happen — despite outcry from witnesses who were recording the violence — demonstrates a breakdown in training and policy by the city,” the statement said. “We fully expect to see the other officers who did nothing to protect the life of George Floyd to be arrested and charged soon.”
Floyd’s family is being forced “to explain to his children why their father was executed by police on video,” they said.
Chauvin faces the same charges that prosecutors brought against another former Minneapolis police officer who was convicted last year.
Richard Frase, a professor of criminal law at the University of Minnesota, said it was reasonable for prosecutors to charge Chauvin with third-degree murder, as opposed to a more severe form of murder, which would require proving that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd.
Frase said the case against Chauvin appeared to be even stronger than the one that Hennepin County prosecutors brought against Mohamed Noor, a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed Justine Ruszczyk in 2017.
Noor was charged with the same combination of crimes, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, and was convicted of both.
In that case, Frase said, the officer had seemingly panicked and fired a single shot. “There’s a question of whether he even had time to be reckless,” he said, referring to Noor. “Here, there’s eight minutes.”
The criminal complaint against Chauvin, Frase said, did not identify any specific motive for officers to kill Floyd, which he said essentially ruled out first or second-degree murder unless additional evidence surfaced.
Frase said he expected Chauvin’s lawyers to seize on the preliminary autopsy findings that showed that Floyd had not died of asphyxiation, which could form the basis for an argument that there was no way Chauvin could have expected him to die. But Frase said another common strategy used by police officers facing charges of brutality — arguing that they were in harm’s way — may be unlikely to convince a jury.
“In this case, there was nobody but Mr. Floyd in danger,” he said. “And there was all that time when it seems there was no need to keep kneeling on his neck like that.”
A government drone in the skies over Minneapolis stokes civil liberties concerns.
A Predator drone operated by the federal Customs and Border Protection agency flew a surveillance mission over Minneapolis on Friday morning as the city reeled from days of escalating violence, stoking suspicion and prompting criticism from civil liberties groups.
An agency spokesman said in a statement that the unmanned aircraft “was preparing to provide live video to aid in situational awareness at the request of our federal law enforcement partners in Minneapolis.”
But after more than an hour flying in a holding pattern at 20,000 feet over the city, according to publicly available flight data, the drone returned to its base in North Dakota. “The requesting agency determined that the aircraft was no longer needed,” the statement said.
The drone was spotted on an online flight-tracking tool and was earlier reported by Jason Paladino of the Project on Government Oversight.
In recent years, U.S. government agencies have used surveillance aircraft to monitor protests in American cities. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is suing the Baltimore Police Department to block its surveillance plane program, called on Friday for Customs and Border Protection to immediately halt the use of its drone over Minneapolis.
“This rogue agency’s use of military technology to surveil protesters inside U.S. borders is deeply disturbing,” Neema Singh Guliani, a lawyer for the group, said in a statement.
Obama addressed Floyd’s death.
Former President Barack Obama on Friday called on the nation to work together to create a “new normal” in which bigotry no longer infects institutions, while former Vice President Joe Biden used a short speech to call for “justice for George Floyd.”
In a statement posted to Twitter, Obama said, “It’s natural to wish for life ‘to just get back to normal’ as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us.” But for millions of Americans, being treated differently because of race is “normal,” Obama said, referencing two other recent cases: Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed after two men confronted him while he was running in south Georgia, and Christian Cooper, who was bird watching in Central Park when a woman called police to say she was being threatened.
“This shouldn’t be ‘normal’ in 2020 America,” Obama said, adding: “It falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station, to work together to create a ‘new normal’ in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who has risen on the national political stage for his coronavirus response, spoke up in defense of the protesters in Minnesota.
“I stand figuratively with the protesters,” he said Friday. “I stand against the arson and the burglary and the criminality, and I think all well-meaning Americans stand with the protesters. Enough is enough.”

In the cellphone video of George Floyd’s death, the arresting officer, Derek Chauvin, keeps a knee pressed on the back of his neck for about eight minutes until Floyd stops speaking or moving.
“You don’t have to sit there with your knee on his neck,” exclaimed a bystander off-camera, addressing the officer in language salted with expletives. “He is enjoying that. You are. You are enjoying that. You could have put him in the car by now.”
For police trainers and criminologists, the episode appears to be a textbook case of why many police departments around the country have sought to ban outright or at least limit the use of chokeholds or other neck restraints in recent years: The practices have led too often to high-profile deaths.
“It is a technique that we don’t use as much anymore because of the vulnerability,” said Mylan Masson, a former police officer who ran a training program for the Minneapolis police for 15 years until 2016. “We try to stay away from the neck as much as possible.”
The full details of what happened have yet to emerge, in particular what police body cameras might show about any altercation between Floyd and Chauvin, 44, a 19-year veteran of the department who has since been fired. Department records indicate, however, that the Minneapolis police have not entirely abandoned the use of neck restraints, even if the method used by Chauvin is no longer part of police training.
The manual of the Minneapolis Police Department states that neck restraints and chokeholds are basically reserved for when an officer feels caught in a life-or-death situation. There was no apparent threat of that nature in Floyd’s detention.
Experts viewing the footage suggest that it was more likely a case of “street justice,” when a police officer seeks to punish a suspect by inflicting pain for something done to the officer during the arrest.
Criminologists viewing the video said the knee restraint not only put dangerous pressure on the back of the neck but also kept Floyd lying on his stomach for too long. Both positions — the knee on the neck and lying face down — run the risk of cutting off someone’s oxygen supply.
“Keeping Mr. Floyd in the face down position with his hands cuffed behind his back is probably what killed him,” said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who studies policing and is a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. Police training started emphasizing avoiding that prone position about 20 years ago, he said.
In terms of chokeholds, those departments that still allow them usually stress using a kind of wrestling hold, in which the officer wraps his arm around the person’s neck and applies pressure, he said. The idea is to subdue them as quickly as possible in order to get them into a squad car, not to leave them in that possibly deadly position for minute after minute as happened with Floyd.
In addition, applying the knee to the back of the neck rather than to the sides risks killing or seriously injuring someone by cutting off the air supply or damaging the cervical spine and other delicate bones in the neck, Stoughton said. No department permits such a technique in ordinary circumstances, he and others said.
The manual for the Minneapolis police calls a chokehold a “deadly force option” and neck restraints a “non-deadly force option.” Neck restraints involve compressing one or both sides of a person’s neck with an arm or a leg without cutting off the air flow through the trachea. A chokehold is meant to cut off someone’s air supply if the officer feels his life is threatened, the manual says.
The manual further explains that the conscious neck restraint may be used against a subject who is “actively resisting,” while rendering the person unconscious should be limited to someone who is aggressive or “for lifesaving purposes.”
John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, did not respond to a query about whether the knee restraint used by Chauvin corresponded to those guidelines.
Many police departments, including the one in Minneapolis, stopped teaching the knee restraint technique and also sought to limit the use of chokeholds after the highly publicized death of Eric Garner in 2014 at the hands of the New York Police Department.
Garner famously gasped “I can’t breathe” 11 times while lying face down on the sidewalk, a sentence that Floyd also said several times. In the case of Garner, investigators determined that the officer who wrestled him to the ground was using a banned chokehold.
The medical examiner ruled Garner’s death a homicide caused by the compression of his neck from a “chokehold” and the compression of his chest held on the ground in a prone position. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who held Garner in a chokehold, was fired but not charged, inciting protests nationwide.
In Minneapolis, the law enforcement training course that Masson directed at Hennepin Technical College stopped teaching the knee restraint technique to aspiring police officers after the Garner case, she said, adding that veteran officers should also have learned of the change.
Students in the two-year degree program required of all prospective officers, she said, were instead taught to apply pressure across the upper back. “As soon as the threat is gone, you stop the force, whatever it might be,” she said.
Department records, however, show that such restraint techniques have continued to be used in Minneapolis, although they are sometimes called by different names. In 2012, there were 79 occurrences and in 2013, there were 69. That dropped to 40 in 2018 and was back up to 56 last year. The technique was used against African Americans far more than other other groups, the records show.
Carl Takei, a senior staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on police practices, said departments that still allowed chokeholds try to differentiate between cutting off the flow of blood, which renders someone unconscious, and cutting off the flow of oxygen, which is deadly.
“There is still a significant risk that attempting to cut off the flow of blood will also cut off the flow of air,” he said, which was why the ACLU opposed the technique. “Chokeholds should be banned across the board.”
Restraint techniques have led to various officers being sent to prison around the country in recent years after being convicted of using excessive force.
The fact that Chauvin kept applying pressure when Floyd was no longer struggling made it appear to be a case of an officer trying to punish a suspect for doing something that the police did not like — which could include resisting arrest, spitting or insulting an officer, experts said. If it was a form of “street justice,” that is considered a form of bullying that police academies also instruct against.
“It is teaching someone a lesson, next time you will think twice about what you do,” said Philip Stinson, a former police officer turned criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University.
Andy Skoogman, the executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, said the group’s 300 members were appalled by the tactic the officer used in the Floyd case and the “lack of empathy” he showed.
“Bottom line: Any type of use-of-force technique must stop when compliance is achieved,” he said, adding that he did not know of any police department in the state that trained in that technique.

Minneapolis Protests Turn Violent as Outrage Grows Over Death of George Floyd [With graphic(s)]

A wave of protests erupted across South Minneapolis overnight and into Thursday, with the police firing tear gas and rubber bullets as people set buildings on fire and looted stores days after George Floyd, an African-American man, died in police custody.
Ash was falling Thursday morning at a shopping center on Lake Street, where the recently renovated Target had been defaced and looted. A nearly completed apartment development across the street had been burned to its concrete lower floor. Other commercial structures were also badly damaged.
Floyd’s death also spurred protests in Memphis and Los Angeles, where law enforcement officials faced off with people blocking Highway 101 downtown.
Floyd, 46, died Monday after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer who pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. A video of the arrest, in which he is heard pleading “I can’t breathe,” spread widely online and was followed by protests in Minneapolis and around the country.
“They executed my brother in broad daylight,” Philonise Floyd told CNN on Thursday morning, breaking down in tears. “I am just tired of seeing black people dying.”
Four officers involved in the arrest were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department, and the FBI joined the investigation into the death of Floyd, a resident of St. Louis Park, Minnesota. On Wednesday, Minneapolis’ mayor called for the police officer who had pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck to be arrested and charged.
The Justice Department said in a statement Thursday morning that it had made a federal investigation into Floyd’s death a “top priority” and has assigned experienced prosecutors and investigators to the case. The department “urges calm as investigators methodically continue to gather facts,” the statement said.
As night fell Wednesday, people filled the streets near the Third Precinct headquarters and soon fires lit up the sky. Images on television and social media showed at least one business, an auto-parts store, ablaze and people carrying goods from another store that had been vandalized.
The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that a Target and Cub Foods store anchoring the corner of East Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue were looted, as were several small businesses, including a liquor store.
As dawn broke Thursday, fires were still smoldering as lines of police officers in riot gear stood off against people who were still out on the streets.
There was also fatal shooting near the protests.
Unlike the first night of protests in Minneapolis on Tuesday, when thousands gathered peacefully, the police reported looting and multiple fires beginning Wednesday afternoon and stretching into Thursday.
The police said that a fatal shooting in the protest area appeared to be related to the looting of a pawnshop where the store owner fired shots. A man was wounded and taken to a hospital, where he died, according to the police.
“Tonight was a different night of protesting than it was just the night before,” said John Elder, a police spokesman.
Mayor Jacob Frey pleaded on Twitter for people to stay at home.
“Please, please Minneapolis,” he wrote, “we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. Please, help us keep the peace. Stay safe and evacuate the area.”
The violence came at the end of what had been a tense period.
Floyd’s family and the mayor have called for charges against the officers involved in his arrest.
Floyd’s death — and the recent killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old African-American man who was chased and fatally shot by two white men in Georgia — has prompted comparisons to other killings of black Americans, including Eric Garner and Michael Brown.
The episode was seen as part of a broader pattern of devastating encounters between African-Americans and law enforcement denounced by civil rights leaders. It has laid bare tensions between members of the local community and the 800-plus police force in Minneapolis, a divide mirrored in other communities across the country.
The Minneapolis Police Department on Wednesday identified the fired officers as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. The mayor said that the dismissals were not enough, calling for criminal charges against the officer who was recorded with his knee on Floyd’s neck.
“I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” Frey said in a news briefing. “If you had done it, or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now. And I cannot come up with a good answer to that.”
Floyd’s sister, Bridgett Floyd, called for justice on NBC’s “Today” show Thursday.
“I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that’s exactly what they did,” she said.
Other members of the Floyd family, appearing on “This Morning” on CBS, said that protests were not enough.
“I don’t want the protests to be for just show,” said Tara Brown, Floyd’s cousin, who appeared with two of Floyd’s brothers. “I want to see action.”
“This was clearly murder,” she added. “We want to see them arrested; we want to see them charged; we want to see them convicted for what they did.”
Video footage of an officer pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck spurred the protests.
The Minneapolis police said they had been investigating an accusation of forgery Monday in the southern part of the city when they confronted a man who was sitting on a blue car and was later identified as Floyd.
“He was ordered to step from his car,” the police department said in a statement Monday. “After he got out, he physically resisted officers. Officers were able to get the suspect into handcuffs and noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress.”
Video footage from nearby security cameras and bystanders did not show any attempt by Floyd to resist officers. Instead, it showed him begging for his life as he lay handcuffed on the ground, one officer grinding a knee into his neck while three others stood by.
The city’s police department has received many excessive force complaints, especially from black residents.
Excessive force complaints against Minneapolis officers have become commonplace, especially by African-American residents. One of the officers involved in Floyd’s death, Chauvin, 44, had several complaints filed against him, three of which led to reprimands for his language and tone.
Chauvin shot a man who was trying to grab an officer’s gun in 2008, according to The Pioneer Press. He was also present at two other shootings, one of them fatal, but it was unclear if he fired his weapon in those cases, according to Communities United Against Police Brutality, a local organization advocating police reform.
African-Americans account for about 20% of the city’s population, but they are more likely to be pulled over, arrested and have force used against them than white residents, police department data shows. And black people accounted for more than 60% of the victims in Minneapolis police shootings from late 2009 through May 2019, data shows.
The tension between the community and the 800-plus-officer force has unfolded in a predominantly white and progressive metropolis, where the white mayor openly discusses systemic racism, the police chief is a black man who embraces a community-oriented approach and residents elected two black transgender people to a City Council that has taken aggressive action to curb racial segregation.
Yet there is a deep rift between the city’s police force — which also is predominantly white — and the community, one that seems to grow larger with each killing.
