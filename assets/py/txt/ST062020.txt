Full text: The University of Minnesota Law School has started a new scholarship honoring George Floyd.
The fund will support a student of color -- particularly a black law student who's pursuing a career in law -- in hopes they can help diversify a largely white profession and help pursue racial justice.
The fund was started by two alumni, Catlan McCurdy and Sanjiv Laud, with a match from the U Law School. The married Minneapolis couple, who met at the school and are both lawyers, were inspired by North Central University, which hosted the Minneapolis memorial for Floyd and created a scholarship in his honor.
"George Floyd's death was just a symbol of a larger problem of racial injustice in this country," Laud said. "And it was one thing we could do. He's never going to be forgotten at the law school."
The endowed scholarship will continue indefinitely. The first scholarship will likely be awarded in 2021. (To support the fund, go to law.umn.edu.)
Garry Jenkins, dean of the University of Minnesota law school, said in an e-mail to the school's community that they are doubling down on "promoting racial justice and changing perspectives, practices, and institutions (in all kinds of ways) to help contribute to the change we need."
Floyd, 46, died May 25 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned his neck to the pavement. Chauvin has been fired and charged with murder and manslaughter. Three other officers involved in the incident have been charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter and murder.

A UNION OF NECESSITY, AS WORLD WATCHES

Full text: Keith Ellison and Mike Freeman go back nearly three decades -- sparring in courtrooms, praising each other at inaugural ceremonies and examining together how police killings are handled in Minnesota.
Now, two of the state's biggest legal personalities are again reunited to confront a legal quagmire that could either gild or tarnish their careers: the prosecution of four former Minneapolis police officers involved in the May 25 killing of George Floyd.
For Ellison, the state's first black and Muslim attorney general, it has also required defending a partnership with a white male prosecutor who lost the trust of many people of color.
"I would hope that if people want us to do something that really has not been done yet, which is to convict a police officer of second-degree murder, that people would not try to prescribe how I do it and who I do it with," Ellison said in an interview last week. "We're trying to come up with justice for George Floyd, and for anyone to say you've got to do it this way and only with these people seems to me kind of unfair."
Freeman declined to comment for this article. He has not spoken publicly since May 31, when Ellison took the lead in prosecuting former Minneapolis police officers Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane. Instead, the former two-time gubernatorial candidate and longtime Hennepin County prosecutor has been silent. Ellison, meanwhile, has become the public face of the prosecution, participating in a battery of national news interviews since the case began.
At the outset, theirs has been a union of necessity: Freeman leads the state's biggest criminal prosecution unit and last year won the only murder conviction against a Minnesota police officer: Mohamed Noor, who fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond in Minneapolis three years ago.
Ellison, who has a deep history in civil rights activism, enjoys a trust from Minnesota's black community that Freeman cannot claim.
"They both need each other and, quite frankly, I think that justice requires it in the context of their partnership and working this case together," said Ramsey County Attorney John Choi, who was the first to charge a Minnesota officer in the death of a civilian when he unsuccessfully prosecuted former St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez in the 2016 killing of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights.
Gov. Tim Walz said he asked Ellison to take over the case upon the urging of Floyd's family. Ellison faces continuing calls to elevate the murder charges against Chauvin to first degree, which would require proof of premeditation. His partnership with Freeman could also fray Ellison's support among the same civil rights activists with whom Ellison has marched for decades.
"When you start off praising Mike Freeman, then where is our justice going to come from?" said Spike Moss, a longtime Minneapolis civil rights activist, who said Ellison surprised him in May when he brought Freeman to a meeting that Moss helped arrange with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Activists like Moss point out that Noor -- the only police officer convicted by Freeman's office -- was a black man who shot a white woman. Many took issue with what they described as Freeman's boastful tone while highlighting that case when he announced the initial charges against Chauvin: third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
More than 20 years ago, Moss led a protest after a black 16-year-old Minneapolis boy was shot by police and charged with threatening the officers with a pellet gun. Ellison represented the boy and rejected a plea deal before Freeman agreed to drop charges. At the rally, Ellison told a Star Tribune reporter that "police brutality … won't change unless we're willing to do something about it."
In 2015, then a congressman, Ellison flew back to Minneapolis to huddle with protesters enraged at the Minneapolis police killing of Jamar Clark. The case prompted an 18-day encampment at the city's Fourth Precinct police station. Freeman declined to file charges in that case, citing evidence that the officers involved feared for their lives during a struggle over a gun. Ellison met with Freeman and urged him to stop using secretive grand juries to make charging decisions in police killings. Freeman has since made those calls himself.
Clark's death was among the many deadly police encounters that weighed on Ellison's mind as he and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington convened a working group on the subject last year. Freeman spoke at several public forums and voiced support for giving Ellison's office authority to lead all of the state's prosecutions of officers charged with killing civilians.
Earlier this month, the Minnesota County Attorneys Association formally agreed to recommend legislation that would require such cases to be investigated by Ellison's office. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput said the decision followed a "very, very long and intense discussion."
Orput gave up jurisdiction in a recent manslaughter case against a sheriff's deputy in his county to avoid accusations of a conflict of interest. He supports this being standard practice for all police-involved homicides.
"Because there's some cynicism out there, and I'm not sure it's not unwarranted," Orput said.
Ellison has a long record of trying cases, but all of that has come as a defense attorney. He said in an interview that he "probably" won't personally try the four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of Floyd. Either way, longtime prosecutors and former attorneys general still say his work on approaching cases from the defense's perspective could serve him well.
"The interesting thing in this is that … the facts involved in this matter are known -- they're on videotape, for crying out loud," said Mike Hatch, a former Minnesota attorney general. "So it's not going to be a great deal of investigation going on to find out what happened. What it's going to be is a great deal of legal issues that crop up -- everything from a change of venue to the difference between second- and third-degree [murder]."
Freeman, 72, is not expected to seek re-election in 2022. He faced swift pressure to charge all four officers in the case after a bystander's video went viral, showing Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as he pleaded that he couldn't breathe.
Freeman's public comments around the initial charges he filed against Chauvin failed to stem the growing unrest over Floyd's death. The first criminal complaint was seen as hastily assembled. Critics noted that it misspelled Floyd's name twice and that it seemed to provide more of an argument against prosecution than in support of charges.
"The charges didn't fit the crime at all, and any intelligent judge would've dismissed it," said Joe Friedberg, a veteran Minneapolis defense attorney.
Two days after Chauvin's arrest, Freeman asked Ellison for help and sent out a news release saying the two would jointly be working the case. But the governor caught Freeman off guard later that evening by publicly declaring that it was his call to tap Ellison to take the lead.
It threatened to implode the partnership before it could begin. But the men quickly agreed to work together on what soon became a crucial chapter in the case.
"We just talked a lot, shared ideas, listened to each other, and we got there," Ellison said.
Less than 48 hours later, Chauvin faced tougher charges of second-degree unintentional murder and the three other former Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's death were jailed and accused of aiding and abetting.
With Freeman standing quietly by his side in front of a room full of national and local press, Ellison reminded all that he would do the talking in this case.
"We have one goal and one goal only: justice for George Floyd," Ellison said.
As the attorney general opened the news conference up for questions, Freeman left the room without explanation.

Man from Staples charged with arson: Bryce Michael Williams is at least the tenth to face federal charges since unrest over George Floyd's killing.

Full text: In the days after protesters set the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct station ablaze, Bryce Michael Williams trekked across the country with a documentary film crew to join other protests over George Floyd's killing in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Denver.
Recounting the journey on an Instagram interview show this month, the 26-year-old self-described semiprofessional basketball player and "TikTok influencer" from Staples, Minn., explained that he was there when the Third Precinct caught fire.
"But at night, I participated in the riots at night of course, cause I'm with my people," Williams told the interviewer. They're "getting teargassed, of course I'm going to riot too."
This week, Williams became the latest in a largely homegrown group of people charged in connection with rioting and destruction of buildings that erupted across the Twin Cities after Floyd's killing by police on May 25.
Williams was charged Monday with conspiracy to commit arson in a sealed federal criminal complaint, which became public Wednesday after he made his first appearance in federal court. He is being held in Sherburne County jail ahead of a Friday detention hearing.
According to a criminal complaint affidavit sworn by a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent, Williams was recorded by surveillance cameras at the entrance of the precinct holding and helping light a Molotov cocktail.
Williams is at least the tenth person charged with either federal rioting or arson charges in connection with the unrest over Floyd's death. All but one of the defendants are from Minnesota thus far and federal court documents have yet to detail any affiliation with organized groups.
As with previous cases, investigators described relying heavily on videos posted online on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok. In this case, authorities said Williams posted to his TikTok account a video of himself standing outside the burning Third Precinct building. According to charges, a New York Times photo depicted Williams holding a Molotov cocktail outside the precinct. A YouTube compilation video of the unrest also purportedly shows Williams holding a Molotov cocktail while another person tried to light it, the complaint says.
Investigators also relied on the June 14 interview Williams gave to an Instagram account called the "n830show," during which Williams described participating in the demonstrations in Minneapolis.
At one point, the interviewer asked Williams whether he considered "burning down the buildings part of the rioting."
"Yeah, definitely that's part of rioting, it's mass destruction -- that's what a riot is, it's mass destruction," Williams said.
At the end of the interview, a commenter asked what it was like watching the precinct burn.
"It's just a surreal moment," Williams said. "For once we feel like we're in complete control. The police can't do anything. We're burning down their sanctuary, their home."
Williams criticized the looting of area stores, however, "because it defeats the overall purpose of the entire protest."
The interviewer asked, "At what point does violence become justified in the face of injustice?"
Said Williams: "To the point where you're finally heard. I honestly believe in do whatever it takes."
His court appearance came one day after a Brainerd-area man appeared in federal court in Colorado on arson charges related to the Third Precinct fire. Dylan Shakespeare Robinson, 22, was arrested in Breckenridge, Colo., on Sunday.
Federal authorities say Robinson is on probation for drug possession. He was recorded by security cameras tossing incendiary devices at the Third Precinct building the night it burned, according to a federal criminal complaint. A Facebook video also showed Robinson setting a fire just outside the first-floor stairwell on the building's west side, the complaint said.

BLACK WOMEN HEED CALL TO RUN: FLOYD'S KILLING INSPIRES LOCAL ACTION, NATIONAL PUSH FOR CHANGE

Full text: Marquita Stephens has been active in her Woodbury community for more than 20 years, working with victims of domestic violence and advocating for safe placements for black children up for adoption. A few months ago, in a moment of prayer, she made a promise to herself: if someone called upon her to take her work to the next level, she would.
She didn't expect that person would be George Floyd, a man she's never met, seen on a video crying out for his mother while a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.
"To have him holler for his mother at that point, you know you had to respond," said Stephens, the mother of two black sons. "If something would happen to them, I'm putting on my shoes and I'm going. That's what a mom does."
Days later, Stephens filed to run for a seat in the state Senate, a 162-year-old institution that has yet to elect a black woman. And she wasn't alone. Three other black women have filed for state Senate seats since Floyd's death, while a half-dozen others filed to run for offices from the state House to Congress.
They're scientists, lawyers, business owners, real estate agents and former employees of corporate America who have been organizing in their communities for years. They're all women, and most are mothers of black children. Only a few had planned to run for office this year before Floyd cried out to his mother and took his last breath. Now they're on the ballot, saying they're answering his call.
"There's never going to be a right time. There's never going to be a time when all the stars are going to align," said Zina Fizer, a self-described "mom first," longtime activist and independent consultant who filed to run for an open state Senate seat in Plymouth. Before Floyd's killing, she planned to wait until 2022 because of the pandemic. "You have to get in right now, because this is the state of emergency that we're in. In order for things to change, it has to be while we're in this perfect storm."
Some are running against other Democrats in primaries. But they say their reason for running now goes beyond traditional political alliances -- they want to be at the table for decisions about police reform and racial disparities.
While the number of people from communities of color serving in the Legislature has grown over the years -- to 21 out of 201 members -- it's still not representative of the state as a whole. People of color make up 20% of Minnesota's population statewide, but only 10% of the Legislature. There are six black and Somali-American legislators currently serving, or 2% of the total Legislature. Statewide, people who identify as black or African-American make up 8% of the population.
In response to Floyd's killing, Democratic state lawmakers are pushing a wide-ranging overhaul of law enforcement. Some of their ideas have Republican support. But previous efforts over the years have been thwarted by divided government or lack of political will. Organizers say they've spent too long working behind the scenes to prop up other candidates who made similar promises, notably after black men like Jamar Clark and Philando Castile were killed at the hands of police.
"You know what? We don't have time for folks to figure it out anymore," said Anika Bowie, vice president of the Minneapolis NAACP. "We don't have time for elected officials, no matter what side of the aisle you are on, to finally treat members of the African-American community and black community with dignity."
During a rally for Floyd, Bowie got on Facebook Live and put out the call to other black organizers: if you're thinking about running for office, now is the time. She teamed up on recruitment with Alberder Gillespie, a candidate in the Fourth District in Congress and co-founder of Black Women Rising.
Gillespie started the group after years of working in DFL politics helping train and coach other candidates, many of them white. But when it comes to black women running themselves, she said she's heard it all: "It's not our time, we shouldn't do that, we would love it, but ... " she said. "There's not a system that's supportive of us. The idea that they can represent me, but I can't represent them."
When Gillespie called Laverne McCartney Knighton about running for a state Senate seat in St. Paul, her first response was: "Me for Senate, are you crazy?" McCartney Knighton worked for 13 years in philanthropy at Target and now connects black students with college scholarships at the United Negro College Fund. She'd pondered running for local office before, but never imagined she'd run for the Senate.
But after discussing it with family and pondering this moment, she said it made sense. "It's weighed on me in ways I didn't even know it would, and I ask myself every day, what are you doing? What are you getting ready to do?" she said.
Husniyah Dent Bradley is a lawyer who works at Mitchell Hamline and ran unsuccessfully for the DFL endorsement in a south Minneapolis House seat. She was weighing whether to run in a primary when her phone started lighting up with messages about Floyd from friends across the country. She ran over to 38th and Chicago, the site where Floyd was killed, and before long she was addressing the crowd. After that, her decision became clear.
"Regardless of if I win, my community needs me and they need voices like mine to lift up their experiences and circumstances," she said.
Aarica Coleman is running in a district represented by Sen. Warren Limmer, R-Maple Grove, the chairman of the chamber's judiciary committee. He's become a target of legislative Democrats, who say he blocks everything from gun control to criminal justice reforms. That's one reason Coleman is running. But as a real estate agent and longtime advocate for affordable housing, she's also running to tackle the larger ecosystem of disparities for black residents from housing and education to economic opportunity.
"I've already been pushing for this and advocating for policy and action that follows it up. There are so many people who have gone unheard and unlistened to," Coleman said. "What happened to George Floyd put it over the top for me."

Full text: Ifeadi Odenigbo hopped into a car and told the driver to find a protest.
Odenigbo didn't wake up May 31 planning to march in Chicago, where the Vikings' fourth-year defensive end attended Northwestern, but he wanted to take action six days after George Floyd was killed while in Minneapolis police custody. Odenigbo quickly found himself in a crowd of strangers unaware that an NFL player was walking with them.
"I just quietly joined in and didn't say a word," he said. "Marched with them for a good 2 miles."
Speaking up is what Odenigbo, the first member of his Nigerian family born in the United States, encourages most in the fight against police brutality and social injustice.
"It was cool to see people of all skin colors," Odenigbo said. "To the people who weren't black, I said, 'Hey, thank you. This wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for you marching or protesting or speaking up.' I'm really grateful for that."
Odenigbo shared his experiences, why he believes education is a root for change and more in an interview for the Access Vikings podcast. This excerpt has been edited for length and clarity.
To listen to the full interview, go to startribune.com/sports.
Q: What led you to jump into that car?
A: You watch that footage and you see a man begging for his life. Asking for some pity. The fact that officer did not give him any type of pity. I'm pretty empathetic, but I think every black person watches that footage and says that could've been me. It's almost like a moral responsibility I have to do something. Hopped in an Uber and said, "Hey driver, I want to go protest." He was a cool Jamaican guy; he was like, "I'm with you, mon." He ended up dropping me off in the middle of downtown Chicago. Ten minutes later, by the grace of God, I was able to see a bunch of people protesting perfectly peacefully. Then I just quietly joined in and didn't say a word and marched with them for a good 2 miles.
Q: What was your emotion like seeing the video in Minneapolis?
A: It didn't really hit me hard like that, because I was almost thinking like, "Man, another black person dying in America." But I called my mom about it and when I was talking to my mom, I broke down and started crying. This man was calling for his mom. You take everything away from him. For a grown man to call for his mom and you still didn't let up? That was devil's work right there.
Q: How have you taken in the way protests have spread across race and nationalities?
A: The murder of George Floyd really opened everyone's eyes, like yo, this has been going on for a while and we just live in an era where we have cameras now. So now we have proof this is happening. The '90s, '80s, you have musicians that rap about it and talk about it and say this is what the police do, but nobody really believes you.
Q: You've said education can create change and you want to talk with Northwestern about solutions. How can that help?
A: I have a platform and I want to do whatever I can to try to educate people -- the people who say they don't understand. Segregation wasn't just 150 years ago. The way people talk about segregation and racism and different bathrooms stalls as if it was 150 years ago, but your parents may remember when there were colored bathrooms, and that doesn't get talked about at all. How you can help is educating yourself, the history of why this has been happening. Once you have the education, you can be empathetic.
Q: How have your experiences shaped your perspective?
A: I was arrested when I was 18 years old in Chicago for hopping the turnstile. At the time, I was wrong. Not saying I wasn't wrong, but at the time they didn't accept credit cards so I needed $2.25 and I simply didn't have $2.25, and I hopped it. Usually a citation, but an undercover cop saw me, put me in handcuffs immediately, read me my rights and asked me if there was a warrant for my arrest. I had a Northwestern jacket and he's asking me, "Where did you steal this jacket from?" I remember just being mindblown by that stuff. I'm just an 18-year-old college kid who didn't have $2.25 on him.
Q: What about the NFL changing its rhetoric about protests during the national anthem?
A: It's the right steps, but I think they were kind of late. Obviously, my teammates like Eric Kendricks had to speak up and let the NFL know like, "You guys were late." We'll find out in the years to come how authentic it is. I did economics, and the thing you got to realize is people have incentives. Obviously from the NFL standpoint, they were getting a lot of heat so they had to speak up. We gave them no choice but to speak up.
Q: What else would you like to add?
A: People in privileged positions should speak up and have their voices be heard. As a minority, I can only say so much. We need the majority of people to speak up and put those people in check that are doing these racist things or forms of racism.

Carter goes before Senate policing panel

Full text: WASHINGTON - St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter on Tuesday urged Congress to make broad national police accountability reforms, including standards that would outlaw chokeholds or neck restraints like the one that cost George Floyd his life at the hands of Minneapolis police.
"We can establish a national standard of policing to curb brutality, end racial profiling, and eliminate qualified immunity," Carter told a Senate panel considering police reforms. "Undoubtedly, you will be pressured by powerful friends who will paint these critical reforms as hostile to law enforcement, but our work to restore Americans' faith in our justice system is a lifeline for officers who serve in good faith."
Carter's testimony came as President Donald Trump signed an executive order providing incentives for better police training, higher certification standards and a national database to track police misconduct, though his reform package fell short of the demands of many protesters and activists.
Carter's comments, delivered remotely at a hearing of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, came in the wake of the anger that enveloped the Twin Cities after Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck as Floyd begged for his life.
Carter, whose father was one of St. Paul's first black police officers, said mayors like him need federal support to regain control in an atmosphere where use of force often takes precedence over helping address what causes crime to begin with.
"Our country's enforcement-heavy public safety strategies aren't designed to address the root causes of crime, only the symptoms," Carter said. "We deserve more than a swift response after a crime is committed, we deserve investment to reduce the number of times we have to call police in the first place."
Carter also asked for a national record-keeping system that will help localities and states weed out problem officers. "We fire officers only to see them shielded from accountability, reinstated through arbitration, or hired into another agency that has no knowledge of their past," he said.
Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota invited Carter to address the Senate committee as Republicans and Democrats in Congress work on separate packages of police reforms. House Democrats have proposed reforms that would ban police chokeholds and make it easier for victims of police brutality to sue officers and departments, something many Republicans oppose.
Trump, working with Senate Republicans, offered a more limited package that also bans chokeholds except in certain circumstances. Echoing many reform activists, the president's order calls on departments to involve social workers and mental health professionals on calls dealing with homelessness, mental illness and addiction.
State lawmakers in St. Paul also are working on police reform legislation this week, though the outcome remains unsettled.
Agreement in Congress may prove more difficult. Democrats and Republicans differ on how much criminal and civil immunity police officers should receive for alleged misconduct. Democrats generally favor less immunity.
Klobuchar, a Judiciary Committee member, pointed to unsuccessful attempts by her and other senators to persuade the U.S. Justice Department to investigate police practices in Minneapolis. The ability of federal officials to compel changes in police behavior, such as prohibiting the use of chokeholds, may find common ground. Other details of reform will likely need negotiation, committee members seemed to agree.
Facing pressure to take action following Floyd's death, Trump announced his order in a Rose Garden gathering where he praised both law enforcement and the families of those who lost their lives during interactions with police.
"We have to find common ground," Trump said "But I strongly oppose the radical and dangerous efforts to defund, dismantle, and dissolve our police departments. … Americans know the truth: Without police, there is chaos; without law, there is anarchy; and without safety, there is catastrophe. We need leaders at every level of government who have the moral clarity to state these obvious facts."
Among those attending the White House rollout was Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber of Minnesota, a former police officer. "The death of George Floyd calls for lasting change, and I am proud to see the President take decisive action on this issue," Stauber tweeted afterward.
Andy Skoogman, executive director of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police, said the chiefs welcome the "consistency" that will come from policies set at by the state and federal government. "We do have agencies across the state that have different policies," he said.
Skoogman pointedly noted, however, that the hold used by Chauvin and Floyd was "unacceptable, unreasonable and unnecessary."
Steve Linders, spokesman for the St. Paul Police Department, said chokeholds already have been banned for years in St. Paul. "No one in our leadership can remember when they were even taught in the academy," Linders said, adding that a new policy in the wake of the Floyd killing made it "crystal clear" that they are "explicitly" banned.
South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, is expected to introduce a GOP police reform package Wednesday that could win Trump's support. But Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a top Trump ally, cautioned that Republicans and Democrats cannot talk "past one another" if they want to pass a reform law.
He referred to Scott, who has been stopped five times by police in the capital, saying, "Tim and I have completely different experiences with the cops. Why is it?"

Floyd decal spurs renaming discussion for park

Full text: Minneapolis Park Board leadership is discussing the renaming of a park in honor of George Floyd, the agency's president said two days after a "Floyd" decal was mysteriously placed on a park sign and later removed.
"I do not know who put the decal up" on the George Todd Park sign, Park Board President Jono Cowgill told the Star Tribune late Monday afternoon, "but I commend whoever it was for their creativity and detailed work."
"I am very open to a park name change for George Floyd," he said, "and have had a few preliminary conversations on the topic with other commissioners."
He said that any decisions about such a move "must be grounded in black and brown community voices."
The unauthorized alteration of the sign along the eastern border of the park occurred Saturday night and was spotted by a maintenance worker on Sunday.
Board spokeswoman Dawn Sommers said the agency had no immediate plans to peel off the Floyd decal to reveal Todd's name underneath.
"I learned [Monday] that the decal is gone," Sommers said. "On Sunday, we had issued the directive to our staff to not remove the decal. ... Unfortunately, one of our early morning weekday crew members was unaware of the directive and removed the decal [Monday] morning."
As for the label, which was a good match to the sign's design, "it was unsalvageable and could not be re-adhered."
Sommers said maintenance workers routinely remove materials posted or displayed throughout the park system, "so it's unfortunate the early morning staff that start at 6 a.m. were unaware of the directive ... to not remove the decal."
The park east of Diamond Lake and along the 5600 block of S. Chicago Avenue sits about 2ü miles south of where a police officer pinned Floyd to the pavement before he died May 25.
George Todd was a park commissioner from 1957 to 1963. The board named the park in honor of Todd. The World War I veteran had cancer at the time. He died in 1964 at age 71.

THEY'RE YOUNG AND READY TO STAND UP FOR JUSTICE

Full text: The killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police has pulled thousands of people across the country out of quarantine and into the streets. Protests and rallies in Minneapolis have drawn those living just blocks from the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was killed, as well as those who traveled hours to get here. As the city enters its fourth week of protests, young people in particular have turned out to voice their anger and mourn Floyd's death. Some were inspired to attend their first-ever protests in recent days. Many of these participants are currently out of work because of the coronavirus, or have yet to find their first post-graduation job. With so much time on their hands, some said there is nowhere else they'd rather be.
Desiree Falkowski, 22, and Shannyn Chesley, 22, of Minneapolis
As recent graduates from Winona State University, Desiree Falkowski and Shannyn Chesley finished their education just before Floyd's death. On Wednesday, they were taking in artwork at the memorial outside of Cup Foods, where the incident began.
"I moved back here, got done with my degree and not even a week later George Floyd was murdered," Falkowski said. "I didn't want to just sit in the suburbs with my education and feel that guilt of not taking action. I'm here, it's COVID, I don't have a job, so I might as well go out there and show up for my community."
It was Falkowski's second visit to the memorial.
"In the beginning I felt more anger, just a lot of emotions," she said. "Now when I come to this site it feels like more of a celebration."
Falkowski said she has recently made connections with other young adults who are passionate about justice issues.
At Winona State, causes like women's or LGBTQ rights were well represented, both Chesley and Falkowski noted, but there were few opportunities to uplift people of color.
"It was very quiet for the black community," Chesley said.
Chesley studied social and political sciences. She said being silent right now was not an option.
"With an education, it's your duty as a young individual to be out there, educating and helping where you can," Chesley said.
Sadie Tollefson, 24, and Cody Rogala, 25, of Edina
Cody Rogala has black friends. But seeing how Floyd died and how the country has rallied around him opened his eyes to the reality of being black in America.
"I think that everyone needs to speak out and everyone needs to stand up, because if we don't then it's just going to be silenced," Rogala said.
Neither Rogala nor Sadie Tollefson had ever participated in a protest before Floyd's death. But they both felt it was necessary to do their part to better the nation.
"I just think it's important to realize that we all have a part to take in this," Tollefson said. "It's time to open our eyes and realize what we need to do to help."
The recent University of North Dakota graduates would normally be working on a June day. But without jobs because of the coronavirus, taking action felt natural.
I'm currently laid off, so it's kind of a good time to take the time that you would usually be working to try and help any way you can," Rogala said.
They are both hopeful that other young people continue to show up in the Twin Cities and across the country.
"I think a lot of young voices are more progressive and actually want to make a change in the world," Rogala said.
Patricia Rogers, 23, of Minneapolis
Patricia Rogers has protested before, notably after the fatal shooting of motorist Philando Castile by a St. Anthony police officer in 2016. But she's never protested like this.
The 23-year-old said she has been out every day since Floyd was killed, with no plans to slow down. "Out of all of them, this was the one that hit me the most," she said.
Other police killings, while no less horrifying, often involve a firearm. Watching the video of Floyd struggling to breathe with a Minneapolis officer's knee on his neck was particularly chilling.
"My ancestors weren't able to record, they weren't able to speak up for themselves," Rogers said. "They were lynched. They were killed for speaking up for themselves. I'm not going to stop coming out here until I see justice."
She has seen people of all ages participate, but she has been particularly encouraged by teenagers and people in their 20s who have made protesting a priority in recent weeks.
Rogers hopes that youth participation only increases, because black and brown people are tired, she said. Either way, she will keep showing up.
"I refuse to live in a world where I'm not equal," she said.

Full text: DULUTH - Gov. Tim Walz gazed up at three bronze faces memorializing the men murdered a century ago Monday on the very downtown corner where he stood.
The governor got a tour of Duluth's painful history exactly 100 years after a white mob lynched three black circus workers, Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie.
Carl Crawford, Duluth's human rights officer, met Walz and his family at the former police station where the men were ripped from their cells on June 15, 1920. The trio was among a group of six black men accused of raping a white woman, Irene Tusken, though her doctor found no evidence of an assault.
From the jail, Crawford brought Walz to the memorial at the intersection of First Street and E. Second Avenue, the spot where Clayton, Jackson and McGhie were killed.
"There is an unbroken line between what happened on that street corner 100 years ago right to George Floyd's murder on the streets of Minneapolis," Walz said later, speaking from the steps of Duluth's City Hall.
The governor's visit marked his first trip outside the Twin Cities since Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police three
weeks ago. The killing sparked protests across the country, spurring a surge of calls for criminal justice reform and the defunding of police departments.
"I think the frustrations, the anger, the things that spiraled out of control in some of the rioting -- all of those are part of a story, but we can't let it detract from what the narrative is here," Walz said. "Systemic racism is prevalent and has been here. It has caused great pain and it is holding all of us back from being the type of state that we want to be."
"Whether you like it or not," he added, "we're going to be defined either by the murder of George Floyd or by how we respond to the murder of George Floyd."
Walz praised Duluth for acknowledging the lynchings, which for decades were barely discussed. In the early 2000s, a group of local activists raised money to build the memorial and remind the city of the shameful episode in its history. Long-planned events slated to bring 10,000 visitors to Duluth for the centennial were postponed because of COVID-19.
Once again linking the past and present, Walz urged Minnesotans not to shy away from tough conversations about race and equity happening since Floyd's death.
"I think if this moment passes, the systemic issues of racism will be so much harder to change," he said.
The governor met privately with 10 Duluth residents, all people of color, to discuss police brutality and other concerns for their community.
"I think it struck a chord with him because he probably didn't expect to hear me say that the same stuff has now happened to three generations -- my parents, myself and my son," said Christina Trok, who sat in the meeting beside her 15-year-old son, Sterling.
"As a mother, I have to fear every single day when my son walks out the door if he's going to come back," she said.
Trok said the governor's words gave her hope. Walz said his goal as governor on issues of race is "to get things through that people in these communities have said will make a difference in their lives for, in many cases, generations."
He spoke broadly of intent to implement policies to lessen gaps between the state's white and black populations, mentioning health, housing and education disparities.
The former high school teacher noted he was talking with his daughter, Hope, about how painful parts of Minnesota's history often aren't in today's textbooks -- like the Duluth lynchings and the Native history of "the land that we stand on."
"We need to think deeply about how we teach these in school," he said. "We need to think deeply about having that reconciliation so the story is told."
On Friday, the state corrected a chapter in its legal history by granting of its first posthumous pardon ever to Max Mason, who was convicted, without evidence, of Tusken's rape in 1920. Backers of the pardon called Mason -- who worked alongside Clayton, Jackson and McGhie -- a "scapegoat" to excuse the actions of the lynch mob.
"We can't control what our grandma and grandpa did, but we can control what we do," Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday at the memorial, where about 150 people gathered for a cookout.
Walz, Ellison and state Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Gildea make up the three-member board that voted to grant Mason's pardon.
The governor placed Ellison in charge of prosecutions related to Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin, the white officer who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes while he pleaded for breath, faces second-degree murder charges. Three other officers have been charged with aiding and abetting.
"This is a social disease buried deep in the core of our identity. It was there from the beginning," Ellison said.
Some laid flowers beneath the reliefs of Clayton, Jackson and McGhie as Bob Marley's music blasted from speakers. Sterling Trok posed for a photo with Ellison and received an offer from a federal judge to come shadow him in court someday.
Christina Trok, who was born and raised in Duluth, said it felt "therapeutic" to share her perspective with those in positions of power.
"I felt solidarity in the room. I felt strength in the room," she said. "And I felt that people were listening."

Downtown residents concerned over police proposals: Group speaks to Mpls. City Council members.

Full text: Board members of a downtown Minneapolis neighborhood group Monday raised concerns about the City Council's intention to create a new public safety model.
Council Member Steve Fletcher spoke to the group of about 40 via Zoom teleconferencing. People on the call asked several questions, ranging from the possibility of a charter amendment to change the Police Department to the number of peace officers who would continue to be paid to respond to 911 calls.
"The city has been through a lot," said Fletcher. "Three weeks ago, we thought we were in a crisis we never thought we would be governing through because of COVID. Then we woke up to the aftermath of the death of George Floyd."
The meeting was sponsored by the Minneapolis Downtown Neighborhood Association, which covers the Downtown West and East neighborhoods. Its website said it represents the interests of 150,000 people who live, work and own property in the area.
Board member Joe Tamburino, who frequently advocates for more downtown safety and police officers, said the City Council's announcement of a possible charter change for a new public safety model was "reckless" and "sent shock waves" to residents.
Board vice chairman Kevin Frazell said he knows something has to be changed with the Police Department, but hoped that neighborhoods could come together to discuss it. "I hear words like defund, abolish and dismantle, but there isn't a common definition of what these mean," he said. "Before voters go to the polls to change the charter, we need to know what will happen. Fear, anger and trauma can't be the guides for a new public safety department."
Board chairwoman Pam McCrea voiced some frustration about seeing only white faces during the meeting, but said "Floyd's death has brought us all together." She said she heard from relatives living in north Minneapolis that they don't call 911 because they have issues with police.
Fletcher said he saw hope that a culture change might be happening after a group of Minneapolis police officers signed a letter condemning Derek Chauvin's actions.

Mpls. park sign altered to include Floyd name

Full text: A sign at a Minneapolis park has been altered to include George Floyd's name, but a city park leader said Sunday that it was changed without permission.
The sign had read George Todd Park until someone added Floyd's surname on Saturday night.
The park along the 5600 block of S. Chicago Avenue is about 2ü miles south of where a police officer pinned Floyd to the pavement before he died May 25.
A Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board maintenance worker happened to see the "George Floyd Park" sign Sunday at the wedge-shaped park just east of Diamond Lake.
He took a few photographs for his supervisors to see and noted that the added decal was the same font as what was on the original sign.
"We are not sure who placed the decal on the park sign, changing George Todd Park to George Floyd Park," Park Board spokeswoman Dawn Sommers said. "The MPRB has not received any requests nor taken any action for renaming the park at 5600 Chicago Avenue South."
Sommers said the Park Board does not have any immediate plans to remove the decal.
George Todd was a park commissioner from 1957 to 1963. The Park Board named the park in honor of Todd while he was still alive, which was an exception to how parks were traditionally named. The World War I veteran had cancer at the time. He died in 1964 at age 71.

Banham willing to help build a bridge: Ex-Gophers star comes from a family of police.

Author: Fuller, Marcus

Full text: Law enforcement runs strong in Rachel Banham's family. So strong that she has tattoos on her right arm of the badge numbers of her father, mother and late grandfather.
If she were not such a basketball standout, as the Gophers' all-time leading scorer and proud new member of the Lynx, she could have added to her family's legacy of police officers.
Her perspective adds something different to the Lynx's platform to tackle social injustice and promote change in the aftermath of George Floyd's death while in Minneapolis police custody.
"Things need to change," Banham said. "No doubt about it. That's the biggest thing with our team and myself. If I can be a bridge in any type of way when it comes to myself reuniting some sort of trust and communication between communities and law enforcement, I would love to do that.
"I'm not going to say I've given up on police, because that's just who I am."
Banham's grandfather, Don Sr., was the first black police officer at the University of Minnesota. He was in charge of the security detail when Martin Luther King Jr. and his civil rights group visited the U in 1963.
Her father, Don Jr., retired in 2011 as a captain in the Minneapolis Police Department after 29 years on the force, which included leading security for the Vikings. Her mother, Melissa, will retire soon after nearly three decades with the Minneapolis police as a sergeant in the sex crimes unit.
As one of the most recognizable athletes in Minnesota, Banham understands the significance of her voice in the movement. The former Lakeville North star emphasizes that people should educate themselves more on racial issues and vote for officials who can make changes. She supports peaceful protests and feels strongly about donating and volunteering.
"It's just so important because we have such a big platform," Banham said. "Our entire team, we've been talking about how we can give back or be a voice for the people who may not be able to be heard."
This week, the Lynx and Timberwolves joined other organizations in the Team Up for Change partnership to address ways people can make a difference in fighting systematic racism.
Banham and former Gophers guard Andre Hollins spent several days this week collecting food and supplies at the Sanctuary Covenant Church in north Minneapolis. It's the home church of their trainer and friend Chauncee Hollingsworth, founder of Hoops and Christ.
"There's a lot of humanity out there, a lot of good people wanting to give back," Hollins said. "We wanted to do anything to help out, especially during the coronavirus [pandemic] and the things that have transpired after George Floyd's death."
Banham stopped training for days after watching the video of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a black man, in south Minneapolis. Following protests for justice and against police brutality in Minnesota and worldwide, Banham agreed changes needed to happen "soon" to protect black lives. It was tough for her to see, though, police as a whole portrayed in a bad light.
"I've been brought up in such an incredible family," Banham said. "They sacrificed. They were great cops and great people. They do things the right way. That's how I've been raised."
Banham's tattoos are proof of how proud she is of her family's roots in law enforcement. Along with giving back, she could make part of her mission soon to build stronger relationships between communities and the police.
"Education is huge right now," Banham said regarding racial issues. "Talking to people and having tough conversations that might not be the most comfortable thing. But it's just about being compassionate and empathetic."

Turning point for power of police union

Full text: A little over a year into his first term, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a new milestone in his promise to remake the Minneapolis Police Department: The city would become the nation's first to ban the controversial "warrior-style" police training for officers.
Standing in front of a crowd at his second State of the City address, Frey proclaimed the training, which teaches officers to see everyone as a threat until found otherwise, contradicts the "values at the very heart of community policing" and would no longer be tolerated, even off duty.
The following week, Lt. Bob Kroll, the brash president of the Minneapolis Police Federation, responded with his own news: The union would start offering warrior training to members for free. "While it seems that the lives of our officers are not important to politicians," Kroll said in a news release, this training would ensure officers survive the dangers of the job.
Kroll's brand of open rebellion against city leaders has become a hallmark tactic for the union during his tenure, and one of many ways the federation exerts power over the city. The union has fewer than 900 members, but it has wielded enormous clout and influence, both at City Hall and the State Capitol.
Critics say the union has for decades served as a shadow command of the Minneapolis Police Department. Now that power is in jeopardy. Last week, in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced that the city would step away from bargaining negotiations with the federation, saying the union has historically stood "in the way of progress." A majority of City Council members have openly committed to dismantling the police force, declaring reform efforts an utter failure. And on Thursday, two dozen officers, including former union president John Delmonico, signed on to a letter condemning the actions of the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground by his neck.
"I think the union has to take a critical, authentic look at the role that they play," Arradondo said in an interview last week. "If we do not change, there are no good outcomes."
Federation Attorney Jim Michels said he was surprised by the chief's announcement, and the union is committed to working with the city to make the department better. "Notwithstanding the public perception, and not withstanding some mistakes that have been made, the federation has been an agent of change. We know we need to continue to work to change the police department."
Kroll and Delmonico did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Political clout
In the early 2000s, the union flexed its clout through political donations and endorsements.
When R.T. Rybak first ran for mayor, the federation endorsed him, which Rybak says gave his campaign a boost among voters who worried he didn't have the political rsum for the office. But the union turned on Rybak when he cut the police budget and refused to appoint the federation's choice for chief. In the 2005 election, the union spent $44,000 on anti-Rybak ads, and another $27,000 to support his challenger, according to campaign finance records.
The union found another enemy in the Minneapolis Civilian Review Authority, an appointed board that investigated allegations of police misconduct. It served as an alternative to the police department's internal affairs unit, in which cops investigate other cops, and its members clashed frequently with police.
In 2007, an attorney for the federation, Anne Walther, sent a letter to Assistant Minneapolis Attorney Lisa Needham asking the city to reinterpret data practices laws and make the review authority's findings more private. Needham obliged, and sent a memo to the citizen board instructing its members they could no longer tell the public when they'd "sustained" a complaint against an officer. They also had to stop informing the victims of police misconduct which parts of their allegations were found to have merit.
The decision took away the last piece of the review authority's power. A few years later, at the behest of the police union and in defiance of pleas from Rybak and community activists, legislators sounded the death knell with a law that prohibits civilian review boards from making "a finding of fact or determination regarding a complaint against an officer." The law marked the end of an all-civilian oversight board for the Minneapolis Police Department.
In 2014, Delmonico appeared in a KSTP report accusing Mayor Betsy Hodges of "flashing gang signs" with a felon in a photograph. "For as critical as she can be with the cops -- is she going to support gangs in this city or cops?" said Delmonico.
The stunt backfired. The report, dubbed "Pointergate," became an international embarrassment when footage emerged showing Hodges and the man were only pointing at each other during a voter drive.
A union like no other
In past generations, the Police Federation operated more like a standard labor union, joining with the teachers union to lobby at the Capitol. The federation also negotiated a stronger contract that gave officers with seniority the power to pick where and when they work.
"The contract is where their power comes from," said former Police Chief Tim Dolan. "And the fact that they have plenty of money. And with the money they have some of the finest attorneys in labor law."
The federation today is unlike any union in Minnesota, far removed from the workers' rights movements central to organized labor, said Javier Morillo, a former labor leader. As American police departments have become more militarized, Morillo said police federations have come to resemble something more akin to a union within the U.S. Army -- an unthinkable premise that would confuse the command structure.
"So long as police departments operate in that same kind of structure, to me it begs the question: Is this really a labor-management situation?" said Morillo.
In a 2018 paper in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, researchers argue that police unions have been given too much power in grievance appeals for officer discipline. The "significant authority" granted in selecting arbitrators in appeals has left elected officials powerless to discipline officers, according to the report.
Unions have traditionally played a key role in ensuring safe and healthy working environments for police, said former Canadian police chief Matt Torigian. But they have also resisted change.
"The difficulty is that very often the unions will be the last line of defense to reforms and changes," he said.
Unions are also predominantly run by white men, he said, and the lack of diverse voices may contribute to the "us against them" mentality within the federation.
The Kroll era
As more candidates in Minneapolis ran on platforms of police reform, the federation's endorsement has lost value. The city reappointed Dolan to a second term as chief, and Dolan said he believes Delmonico and the union did him a favor by recommending against it.
Kroll found power in a different manner: using the union's protections to publicly defy the city, and to defend officer misconduct by casting the reform-minded elected officials as "lunatic left" radicals who bully police for political points.
"Kroll instigates behind the scenes all the time, and if anybody thinks he doesn't, they don't know what they're talking about," said former Assistant Minneapolis Police Chief Kris Arneson. "I've seen him agree to reform efforts and then hack away at them behind the scenes."
In a statement posted to Facebook last week, the union denied hindering efforts at reform. "Despite the Federation's efforts to assist in bringing about meaningful changes, it recognizes that rarely have these efforts been successful. However, this is not because of the Federation or the terms of the labor agreement, but rather because management has failed to implement the changes the parties agreed to make."
Kroll has gathered many critics over his nearly five years as union president. Many have questioned his racial attitudes -- "KKKroll" has become a mainstay protest slogan.
"He's their bulldog when they have to go in to anything in the disciplinary process," said Sean Broom, a former City Council aide. "Bob Kroll has shown himself to be an extraordinary advocate on their behalf. That's why he was elected, that's why he was re-elected."
'No middle ground'
In 2018, in a move to make Minneapolis a safer city for immigrants, Frey announced all police squad vehicles would be fitted with placards in Spanish listing people's rights when encountering ICE agents.
Kroll responded with a statement calling the mayor's decision "simply insane," accusing Frey of prioritizing "people who are here ILLEGALLY" over victims of shootings.
Michels denied that Kroll is purposely undermining reforms when he publicly defies Frey.
"I think it's more of a personal thing between the mayor and Bob. And it's almost like action and then a reaction and then a reaction to the reaction and on it goes."
Kroll and other union members appeared in a mailer endorsing Tim Pawlenty, a Republican who ran for governor on a tough-on-immigration platform, alongside the message: "Our state is wasting millions on benefits for those here illegally." After Jeff Johnson beat Pawlenty in the Republican primary, the union endorsed Johnson in the general election.
When protesters called for police reforms after an officer fatally shot Thurman Blevins, a black man, in 2018, Kroll said that Blevins was "fair game" because he was carrying a gun. Kroll called on anyone with "ice flowing through your veins" to join the department.
"He is reminding the rank and file of the police department who they should listen to," said City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison.
As Frey battled with President Donald Trump on Twitter over the costs to the city of a campaign event in Minneapolis, Kroll appeared on "Fox and Friends" to bash the mayor for not allowing police to wear uniforms at the rally. The interview found Kroll a powerful new ally: Trump. At the rally last October, Trump brought Kroll on stage, boosting Kroll as a folk hero "pouring out his guts" to stand up to the city's liberal establishment.
After the killing of George Floyd, Kroll wrote a letter to the force defending the police officers involved and accusing the city of making its police scapegoats." Friday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the boarded-up union offices in Minneapolis demanding Kroll's resignation.
Rybak, now CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation, is working with the city to review police contracts across the country and find precedents for reform. For true change to take root, said Rybak, more officers must defy the union and come out publicly to condemn the bad actors that make possible the brutality displayed in the Floyd video.
"There's no middle ground anymore," Rybak said.

Full text: Josie Johnson had always felt a bit of hope.
She stayed hopeful as a teenager in Texas, gathering signatures on a petition to end the poll tax. Hope drew her from Minneapolis to Mississippi during the fight for voting rights. For decades, she marched and organized in the hope her children's children would grow up in a different world.
Her children have grandchildren now. And after more than six decades of tireless civil rights work, Josie Johnson watched a policeman in her city casually crush the life out of George Floyd on camera.
"My hope was drained that day," said Johnson, who chose "Hope in the Struggle" as the title of her biography.
Minneapolis was burning, as it had burned in race riots before. Crowds took to the streets, protesting like so many had done so many times before.
Johnson found herself "trying to remember what we've been fighting for and what might need to be different in this struggle."
But something in this moment did feel different. Hope broke through the hurt. For Johnson, it came from the energy she felt from the young people in the streets, taking up the fight to build a better world for her great-grandchildren.
"This excitement I have felt of our young black boys and girls, men and women," she said. "That spirit and strength of our people keeps some of us fighting and being hopeful."
For historian Mahmoud El-Kati, the breakthrough moment came when he heard about the Black Lives Matter march in Pocatello, Idaho.
"If you don't understand the story behind the story, you don't understand the story," said El-Kati, a professor emeritus of history at Macalester College in St. Paul.
There was something about the sight of the policeman, smirking at the camera, ignoring the cries for help and for air from the unarmed man under his knee, that gave some white Americans their glimpse of the story behind the story. So this is what it's like, some realized, watching the video, then watching police attack peaceful demonstrators night after night. So this is how it feels.
"The fact that I'm talking to you now and not some statistic is only by the grace of God. That's a possibility for every black man," said El-Kati, author of "The Myth of Race, the Reality of Racism."
Watching that hard truth play out on camera "shook certain quarters in the white community," he said.
The question now is what the community does with that new insight into the white supremacy woven into its history and institutions.
"Whatever happened to the civil rights movement?" August Nimtz Jr., professor of political science and African-American and African studies at the University of Minnesota, used to pose that question to his students. The tongue-in-cheek answer: "Out of the streets and into the suites."
Now his students are out in the streets, getting a better education than any classroom could offer.
The long view of history offers a depressing view of history repeating. The lynchings of a century ago, the assassinations of half a century ago, the black men killed by police last week, last month, last year.
But the long view of history also shows of just how fast things can change. Nimtz joined the first George Floyd protest -- a calculated risk for a 77-year-old African-American man in the middle of a pandemic.
"It was almost like a moment of liberation," he said. "We had come up for air."
Nimtz has seen other movements fizzle out over the years, often at the urging of community leaders -- the people in the suites -- who urge activists to exercise their power at the voting booth instead.
"I tell my students, if you think the most important thing you can do is vote, how did someone like me, who at one time could not vote, get the right to vote?" Nimtz said.
The first time he tried to vote, in 1964 New Orleans, he was turned away because of the color of his skin.
"Four years later, I was able to vote. You have to ask yourself, what happened in between?" he said. "It's because people like me and our allies had been in the streets. That's the way."
Josie Johnson's father wanted to be a lawyer, only to have his dreams crushed in the segregated South.
You have to keep on keeping on, he taught his daughter.
"At my age, those who have been in the struggle, we've seen it, we've known it," she said. "And we too have to keep on keeping on."

Familiar grief and trauma fuel new resolve

Full text: For Vanessa Anyanso, to be black in America is to constantly mourn lost sons and daughters.
It's a sentiment that Anyanso, a 26-year-old graduate student studying for a doctorate in counseling psychology at the University of Minnesota, has felt since the release of the video of George Floyd, a black man, dying while being restrained under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer for nearly nine minutes.
Amid the resulting widespread unrest across the Twin Cities, Anyanso was tired of scrolling up and down Twitter but did not want to go out to protest. Her parents pointed out the dangers of her going out during the coronavirus pandemic.
"Because I'm a black person in America, every time I walk out of my house there is a possibility I won't come back, and because I'm a black woman unfortunately my death may not be as mourned or remembered as others," Anyanso said. "If I'm going to be in danger no matter what I do, at least I want to directly help some people that are suffering right now."
That's why Anyanso decided to start "running supplies for the revolution" by collecting money and buying and donating items to help protesters and other organizations in north Minneapolis. For Anyanso, it was considering what's more dangerous: The pandemic or being black in America?
The digital graveyard of viral videos depicting the killings of black people by police and others has become a recurring source of trauma for black people in America. There are the hashtags, the decision about whether to watch the video, the televised pain of mourning families, the swarming media, the protests -- if the death gets enough traction on social media -- and calls for justice.
And each time, black communities have to find ways to cope with the grief, anxieties and fears stemming from violently losing black men, women and children. Nationally, the number of black people experiencing anxiety or depressive disorders rose from 36% to 41% in the week after the video of Floyd's death circulated the internet and unrest began, according to a joint Census Bureau and National Center for Health Statistics survey. A 2017 survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found black people were more likely than white people to experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or that everything is an effort, all or most of the time.
Marlee Dorsey, a licensed therapist in Minneapolis who sees clients through her Reviving Roots Therapy and Wellness practice, said for her clients "almost every session" has been about George Floyd, police brutality, racism, their anger toward the police, participation in protests or feeling validated by seeing others share their rage.
Dorsey said part of the problem is that people misconstrue trauma as "something that breaks you" and that can make people feel ashamed or hold in their feelings about it.
"The way that the mainstream culture talks about it is that 'we experience something bad and here are your symptoms and these are the things that happen for you, because we have to put things in a nice little box," Dorsey said. "But trauma is being pulled over by the police and all of the thoughts that go through your brain. You have that wave of fear, you think about the story your cousin told about how they got pulled over, your parents, grandparents, their stories. … It's not just your experience that you're holding, it's your entire network's experience too, and that's what makes it more powerful."
The first time watching Floyd die on screen was "the equivalent to seeing a black man hanging from a tree," said Korey "XROSS" Dean Sr., founder and executive director of the Man Up Club, a Roseville-based organization focused on mentoring black males, teaching them how to process their feelings and how to interact with the police. "To see the foam that was around his mouth, my heart kind of jumped out of my chest at that point," he said.
The key thing Dean said he tells young men is that they're valued and that their voice matters, and he gives them space to talk about mental health, abuse and embarrassment. Any sense of hopelessness could lead them to destructive behaviors, he said. He said the group was out in the community helping with cleanups in recent weeks, but they've also talked about ongoing fear of the police. Dean said he watched the video of Floyd's death multiple times because he "had to watch the evilness of it."
"The only reason I stopped watching it was because my eyes kind of opened up to the reality of if I continue to watch it, I'm really going to be traumatized," Dean said.
Anyanso hasn't watched it. The last time she watched a video of a black person dying was Philando Castile, whose death was broadcast on Facebook Live in 2016 after he was shot by a St. Anthony police officer.
Her thinking is, "The people that need to see videos in order to understand that it's a problem won't even care, so what are we doing besides traumatizing our people all of the time?"
She knows the names of so many more black people whose deaths sparked outrage: Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland and most recently Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger who was chased down and killed in Georgia, and Breonna Taylor, killed by police while she had been sleeping at home in Kentucky.
Anyanso knows the wave of fear when she sees a cop car or remembers trying to prevent police encounters on her jogs back home in Gaithersburg, Md., by wearing a shirt from her high school or her Columbia University undergraduate shirt. She's been in the car when her own father has been pulled over and remembers that fear.
She has found solace in action. She has organized donations of more than $17,000 worth of food, diapers and other supplies to organizations and got to help the protesters in her own way. She's also been trying to check on her friends to see how they're coping amid the pandemic and the aftermath of Floyd's death.
"I know if I allowed myself to feel the depths of the situation, I would probably not be able to get out of bed," Anyanso said. I would say my coping is through doing these supply runs, but I fully realize I have not been able to give myself space to grieve properly."
For now, Anyanso plans to keep raising money and making donations to organizations in need. But as she looks ahead, "it's not about the deaths that have happened, it's about the deaths that I fear will happen."
"Every time one of these murders happen, when people are protesting they're not just protesting that murder," Anyanso said. "It was influenced by all of the names known and unknown."

Resting in power: Lifted by social media, two art-school grads create "Say Their Names Cemetery" to memorialize victims of police violence.

Full text: Taren Vang and Ong Yang of St. Paul donned blue surgical masks and knelt to place flowers at a corrugated-plastic headstone bearing the name of Vang's former boyfriend, Travis Jordan, a suicidal man who was fatally shot by Minneapolis police in 2018 when he refused to drop the knife he was carrying.
"He was killed by two rookie cops," said Vang of the incident, which didn't result in criminal charges. "It was during a wellness check, and they came and killed him instead."
Jordan's headstone was one of 100 in "Say Their Names Cemetery," an art installation on a grassy field at 37th Street and Park Avenue in south Minneapolis, just blocks from where George Floyd was killed while in police custody.
Each headstone -- printed with a name, date and location of their death, and the words "Rest in power" -- represents an African-American who has died at the hands of police.
The project was hatched in a matter of days by artists Anna Barber and Connor Wright, both 22 and recent graduates of the University of Pennsylvania.
They were quarantined at home in Chicago and Philadelphia, respectively, and kept seeing people share the same list of people killed by law enforcement.
They wanted to do more than reshare it. A cemetery, they thought, "would be a really impactful way to allow people to visualize and humanize these lists," said Barber, and also serve as a community gathering space.
One problem: They'd never been to Minneapolis.
On Apple Maps they found the open park space on city-owned land. They posted to Instagram, asking for contacts in the Twin Cities, and quickly amassed 15 future friends. They finalized their project plan June 1, booked flights and an Airbnb and arrived June 3.
In one day, they raised $1,000 in donations and decided to pay the remaining expenses out of pocket (they declined to say how much).
The tombstones were printed with the help of the UPS Store at 2751 Hennepin Av. S., which insisted on staying open late for the artists. Community members covered the monuments with plastic bags to protect them from rain. A construction worker and his wife donated 300 metal stakes.
One night, Barber and Wright got an e-mail saying people were checking to make sure the cemetery was OK.
"I almost cried reading that e-mail," said Wright. "To see how the community made it their own, and has done with it what they see fit, is absolutely so powerful."
They plan to print 500 aerial photos of the cemetery and sell them for $1,000 each to raise money for the Anti-Racism Fund (antiracismfund.org). They are working on a website for the project; the e-mail account is saytheirnamescemetery@gmail.com.
Community vigil
Wright and Barber helped organize a vigil there last Sunday. As night fell, about 300 people streamed into the park. A Trader Joe's employee handed out donated flowers. People sitting on the grass shouted George Floyd's name.
Two friends, Analyah Schlaeger Dos Santos and Sophie Seibure, sat on a hill gripping a flag with a demented smiley face and red handprints on one side, and white text that read "This is our America" on the other.
"What you see around us, the shocking things, this is what America is, so we made a new flag," said Schlaeger Dos Santos.
Minneapolis resident Arwo Warsame and her children, Aliya Habib, 4, and Amin Habib, 5, spread flowers at several of the gravestones. For her, the most moving part was "all the people uniting, joining from all races, and honoring [Floyd's] life, and respecting and understanding the pain and our reality," she said.
Wright and Barber were heading home this weekend, but the project will stay.
"We are not intent on deciding the fate of this," said Wright, his black face mask slipping off his mouth. "We're going to make sure we follow what the community wants."

A CENTURY OF SHAME: PROTESTS ARE ECHO OF DULUTH'S NOTORIOUS LYNCHINGS IN 1920.

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 6/21/2020: Thsi story had an incorrect statistic. Duluth has the second-highest gap in poverty rates between black and white residents among U.S. metro areas its size, behind Rochester. DULUTH - For years, Jordon Moses has been telling their story, evoking their names: Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie.
Most recently he did so with a megaphone to address a crowd of hundreds who knelt outside Duluth's City Hall to protest the death of George Floyd.
"It's never been more clear," the 29-year-old African-American man said afterward, "to see how the lynchings 100 years ago relate to our contemporary realities."
Monday will mark three weeks since Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody and a century since Duluth's long-hidden shame. On a June evening in 1920, three black circus workers -- Clayton, Jackson and McGhie -- were lynched by a mob after a white woman said she was raped.
Moses has spent almost two years working full time to plan a slate of events to honor the lives of those men, who are memorialized in bronze at the downtown street corner where they were killed.
"Those lynchings were based in fear and control and racism and white supremacy," Moses said. They represent the cultures and systems he's been fighting against for 11 years, since he started college at the University of Minnesota Duluth.
But so little has changed. Moses is tired.
Tired of his skin color drawing second looks from shop owners or security officers. Tired of fielding near-constant requests to provide a person of color's perspective on boards and committees. Tired of talking about these things and feeling like no one is listening.
Just 3% of Duluth's 86,000 residents identify as black. The northeastern Minnesota city, known for its hilly trails and sparkling Great Lake, for years tried to bury its past like the ships that succumbed to stormy Superior's wrath.
Some say the decadeslong unwillingness to discuss the lynchings fostered a culture that allows people to avoid tough conversations about race and privilege and justice today.
"To truly, truly honor those three men," Moses said, "we need to put in place policy, practices, a culture shift that would ultimately create a community in which we all value black lives."
A mob ruled
Word traveled fast around Duluth that the postman's daughter, 18-year-old Irene Tusken, had been raped by a group of black men who worked for a traveling circus after her boyfriend said as much to police.
Officers caught up to the circus train and had the couple identify six suspects. As daylight faded over Superior Street in downtown Duluth on June 15, 1920, a mob of thousands overcame a handful of police to rip the black men from their jail cells.
They held a sham trial and quickly convicted three of them, dragging Clayton, Jackson and McGhie to the corner of First Street and Second Avenue E., where they were lynched.
"Troops rush to aid of helpless police," the Minneapolis Tribune reported the next day. "5,000 in crowd which overpowers guards, breaks down cell doors and seizes doomed men."
Yet there was no evidence the attack on Tusken took place. Her physician said he could not find any signs of a rape or assault.
A photo of white men grinning next to the corpses was later turned into a postcard.
That image was on the cover of "The Lynchings in Duluth," in which author Michael Fedo describes a population hostile to a growing black community, with many residents outraged at the black workers recently brought in by U.S. Steel to end a strike threat and other residents recently back from war and itching for glory.
The event captured national attention and led the Legislature to pass an anti-lynching law the next year.
But Duluthians hid the shameful act in the community's subconscious, and for decades state history books failed to mention the lynchings. When researching his book in the 1970s, Fedo ran into resistance from local officials.
"You had this wall of silence," he said. "It was something folks thought should not be discussed or talked about."
An entire generation mostly tried to suppress memories of the incidents. Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken, the great-nephew of Irene Tusken, didn't know about his familial connection to the lynchings until his mom divulged the secret after his great-aunt had died in 1996.
It took until the 21st century for the story to again rise to prominence locally, helped largely by the memorial erected near the site of the lynching in 2003 after a group of activists raised money and awareness about the killings.
Etched in stone above the metal reliefs of Clayton, Jackson and McGhie are the words: "An event has happened, upon which it is difficult to speak and impossible to remain silent."
'It could have been you'
On a break home from college in the early 2000s, De'Lon Grant stopped to read that powerful phrase for the first time. Looking beneath it was like looking in a mirror.
Grant modeled for the memorial during his junior year at Duluth's Central High School. He was Isaac McGhie.
"It's jarring because it also reminds you that it could have been you or it could be you," he said. "That's the reality that we face, that we've always faced in this country."
Grant moved away for college and never looked back. Now starring in a Broadway musical, he remembers Duluth with a mix of nostalgia and reflection on a past when he hadn't yet fully embraced his identity as a gay black man.
"There is a beautiful community there," Grant said. "But not having somebody that looks like you in the community, it can get hard."
Jeanine Weekes Schroer, a professor at UMD, said that after living here for nine years she still wears a shield she crafted growing up under the glare of the dominant culture: "I act like a person who is visiting and who might be asked to leave at any moment."
Carl Crawford, the city's human rights officer, said he's seen numerous talented black people move away over the years after experiencing at-times flagrant racism.
"I don't hold that against them at all. I get it," he said. "When I hear or have conversations with friends and colleagues, they talk about creating safe spaces. Who wants to live in a space to just be in one box?"
Disparities between black Duluth residents and their white counterparts are drastic, in some cases significantly more severe than other cities.
Duluth has the second-highest black poverty rate among all metro areas its size in the country -- behind Rochester, Minn. -- with more than half of black residents living below the poverty line. In a given year barely half of black high school seniors graduate from Duluth schools, fewer than the state average. Homeownership is largely a privilege of white residents, with 4 out of 5 black Duluthians renting.
As in other cities, the jail population is disproportionately black, and residents of color have been subject to racial profiling by police.
Augsburg University Prof. William Green, a specialist on race in Minnesota, said those disparities can't be picked off one at a time.
"There's a tendency in society to see problems singularly and come up with a solution that only deals with that problem and not systematically -- namely racial tension," he said. "All these things are connected and we need leadership that will coordinate all of that."
'Deterred but not defeated'
Their graves were quiet on Thursday afternoon, though there had been visitors recently. Flowers were starting to fade and Black Lives Matter signs starting to curl.
The unmarked burial sites of Clayton, Jackson and McGhie were found at Duluth's Park Hill Cemetery in 1991, and gravestones were placed in a ceremony that year. Today a stone bench sits beneath a young oak tree and draws visitors to the stark words on the markers that sit just below the grass surrounding them: "Deterred but not defeated."
For the first time, Duluth will have a place to coordinate its response to the inequities facing the city's black population. The City Council created the African Heritage Commission last month at the behest of Janet Kennedy, who became the first African-American council member in the city's 150-year history when she was elected last year.
With stronger representation, coupled with the ongoing discussions on police violence and racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd's death, there is some optimism that healing can finally start to begin.
"The hard ask is that white folks have to really just listen to what black people are saying about their experience and assume whatever counterposition occurs to them while they listen is just wrong," Schroer said. "The burden isn't to be morally clean. The goal is to be morally productive."
The Clayton Jackson McGhie memorial has become a gathering place in the weeks since Floyd's death. Young people have organized daytime cookouts, nightly marches and a community mural project as the site of a horrific crime becomes a place to process trauma.
A crowd of 10,000 was originally supposed to gather at the site of the lynchings on Monday to commemorate the centennial, but COVID-19 concerns pushed that back to 2021.
Moses, a key organizer, will have to make a much longer drive when that happens. He and his wife, Terresa, are moving to Minneapolis, a city where they know a much larger black community exists.
"Many of the people that we're interacting with today, those 10,000 folks in the mob were their grandparents, their parents, their aunts, their uncles. They shaped the values of those families," Moses said. "That's an important thing for us to understand."
Duluth's population has remained flat for decades, but its share of nonwhite residents has steadily grown, a trend expected to continue. The 1% projected population increase in St. Louis County between now and 2035 will be solely due to new nonwhite residents, say state estimates.
Crawford, the human rights officer, said "there's certain things that need to happen" to make Duluth a more comfortable place for citizens of color.
"I push back always against the Minnesota Nice way of doing things," he said. "Let's be open and honest and have dialogue to recognize there's a problem. Because if we never recognize it as a problem, we'll never really have meaningful work toward changing it."

Full text: Minneapolis City Conference football coaches and players met via Zoom on Wednesday evening in what was probably the most important meeting they'll have all year.
The topic of football never came up.
Concerned for the well-being of their athletes against a backdrop of protests and civic unrest, Minneapolis South coach Rodney Lossow and Minneapolis Washburn coach Ryan Galindo, both of whom live and teach in the city, conceived the meeting. They saw it as a chance to give players and coaches a platform to make their voices heard.
Lossow, who coordinated the meeting, said it sprang from a feeling that they needed to reach out to their players after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. Their neighborhoods turned tumultuous and fearful with rioting and looting in the days that followed. South's field, just south of Lake Street, is a couple of blocks from stores and buildings damaged or destroyed by fires.
"I wanted to know what I could do," Lossow said. "Guys like Galindo got my brain stirring and I thought, 'OK, what can we do virtually?' "
Eleven players, representing five of the city's seven schools, and 10 coaches from those five took part, along with Antony Fisher, Minneapolis athletics and activities director. The Star Tribune was invited to be present as well. Lossow asked for and received participants' approval to share the recording on YouTube.
The players, invited as team leaders by the coaches, were asked to address three questions: How do you feel about what happened? What would you like to see changed? What are you afraid of?
Zoom would not have been the platform for this conversation if not for the pandemic. Yet watching teenagers of all colors speak truth from their kitchens or living rooms or cars about what changes they want to see, both in their own behaviors and from the adults in their communities, created a powerful experience. The coaches responded into their phone or laptop cameras with passion and emotional pleas for understanding and unity.
"This isn't the greatest way to meet, but it was probably the best way because all got heard," Lossow said.
Emotions ran from anger to frustration, from fear to worry. And to a sense of hope.
'Am I next?'
Washburn senior John Lyman led off the responses from players and set a tone by calling out the behavior of police.
"We need to find the root of the problem, and that is police and how they become police [officers]," said Lyman, who is white. He called for more rigorous evaluation before they are hired to root out those with racist backgrounds.
Mistrust of law enforcement was a thread that carried throughout the meeting. Many players said they frequently feel scrutinized and suspected simply because of the color of their skin.
"It's how black males are looked at," Washburn's Jamar Nelson said. "It's not fair how we should go out every day and be scared of police officers. They're supposed to be here to protect and serve us, but we feel like we're not being protected and served. Were dying."
"The thing I'm afraid of," said Minneapolis North senior quarterback Zach Yeager, "is that that next person to be killed by a police officer is me or one of my loved ones."
Said Minneapolis Southwest senior Darnell Harper: "I'm black, I'm 16 and I'm scared that the next one could be me."
Southwest coach Josh Zoucha told of receiving a photo from the mother of recently graduated senior T.K. Marshall, a star running back on last fall's team. The picture showed Marshall walking among protesters in Minneapolis, holding a sign that read "Am I next?"
"That crushed me," Zoucha said. "To hear the things these kids have to think about every day before leaving the house that I don't have to think about, it's powerful. These kids are speaking their truths."
Mixed (blue) feelings
Yeager's coach, Charles Adams III, is also a Minneapolis police officer and a longtime student resource officer at the school. The Minneapolis School District's recent decision to end its relationship with Minneapolis police meant the end of Adams' role within the school.
"I'm torn right now," said an emotional Adams, the only black head coach in the meeting. His teams have reached six consecutive football state tournaments, making the Prep Bowl three times and winning the Class 2A championship in 2016.
"You see the color of my skin. You know what I do. I am in the worst possible position you could be in. I'm from the north side, but I wear blue. My daddy's a cop. My uncle's a cop.
"But under no circumstance did I feel that anything that was going on [with George Floyd] was justified. I'm not stupid. I'm not blind. Sometimes people don't understand that the uniform comes off. I do take the uniform off."
Adams talked about his role during the nights of violence.
"I had no clue if I was going to come back home. I'm talking going from fires to fires," Adams said, passion rising in his voice. "Getting shot at. Stuff thrown at me. And all I'm thinking about is that Polar Pride, boys. Can I get back to them?"
Optimism, plus skepticism
That fear was not limited to those in authority. Roosevelt senior lineman Jesus Moreno said he felt compelled to participate in the peaceful marches but couldn't leave home, fearing for his family's welfare.
"The day after [Floyd] died, we went down to Chicago Avenue to see where it happened and there were a lot of people there, saying his name. It was really powerful," said Moreno, who is Hispanic. "I wanted to march in the protests, but my family was hearing threats that there were people going into houses and hurting people of color. If I was gone, I wouldn't be able to do anything for my family."
Amid the overall serious overtone of the meeting, many echoed a theme of hope. That, finally, there might be an end to the inescapable racial oppression felt so strongly by the black community.
"I'm saddened, but I'm also glad," Yeager said. "I'm glad to see people of all races come together to fight for the same cause."
Minneapolis South senior Kader Diop echoed Yeager's thoughts. "I'm hopeful because I think the spark from this case is bringing people together," he said. "Not just people of color but people of all races. I'd like to see that continue."
Not all saw hope as a shining light, however. Many said they fear the current groundswell of change will fade away, as has happened before.
"There's hope in the air, and that scares me," said Robert French, a Minneapolis Southwest assistant coach who is black and wore a custom-made hat that read "Make Racists Afraid Again." "We cling on to hope. I'm tired of hope. The feeling is all too familiar. Hope tends to let our guard down, until another black man, woman or child is murdered. It will stop when we the people have had enough that we no longer react, that we take action."

'It was like a punch to the gut': Homeless asked to vacate park: Notice came on heels of hotel eviction, but the Park Board rescinds its order, averting standoff.

Full text: Dozens of homeless men and women who sought refuge in a south Minneapolis hotel during the street protests following the death of George Floyd are still struggling to find a safe place to stay amid multiple eviction notices.
More than 200 homeless occupants of the former Sheraton Minneapolis Midtown Hotel, near Lake Street and Chicago Avenue, awoke to an unwelcome surprise Tuesday morning, when they were ordered to vacate their rooms at the hotel, which had been converted into a shelter for the homeless during the recent riots.
Lacking other options, many migrated with tents and bags to a shady hilltop overlooking the lake at Powderhorn Park in south Minneapolis. Seeking safety in numbers, about 30 people pitched tents at the northwest
corner of the park, near 10th Avenue and E. 32nd Street.
On Friday morning, however, these tent dwellers got another surprise wake-up call. About 7 a.m., several officers with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board walked through the makeshift camp and gave everyone written notices saying the camp would be dismantled within 72 hours. "It was like a punch to the gut," said Dennis Barrow, who moved to the camp on Thursday after being evicted from the hotel. "We have nowhere left to go."
The back-to-back notices outraged humanitarian aid volunteers and nearby residents of the Powderhorn Park neighborhood, who poured into the park on Friday morning to show support for the tent dwellers. Many handed out water, food and medical supplies and denounced the Park Board's action during a hastily arranged media event near the tents. Some vowed to return to the site to prevent the homeless from being removed.
A standoff was ultimately avoided when the Park Board late Friday rescinded its 72-hour vacate notice and said tent dwellers would be allowed to remain while local officials worked on a solution.
"An eviction notice is not a solution," declared Grace Berke, community coordinator for the Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association, which issued a statement denouncing the action. "These are our neighbors and we will not allow them to continue to be pushed further and further out where they can't be seen."
Many who arrived at the park this week looked exasperated after enduring weeks of stress and trauma. The former hotel where they had been staying was near the center of the riots, and many had moved into the building with the hope they would be offered stable housing. Instead, the hotel came to mirror the chaos in the streets nearby, with rampant drug use and fights in the hallways, residents said.
There was extensive destruction to the hotel in its final days, which occupants blamed on a handful of troublemakers. Doors were bashed in. Vending machines were dismantled. Flat-screen televisions were ripped from walls. Graffiti was sprayed in the stairwells. By Friday, the front lobby was in disarray, with garbage and broken furniture strewn about the entrance.
"A lot of angry people terrorized this property on purpose because they didn't like what happened to George Floyd and they stopped caring," said Michelle Smith, an organizer with Freedom from the Streets, who provided outreach to those at the hotel.
The hotel's owner, Jay Patel, declined to be interviewed Friday, as he gazed over his damaged property from the parking lot.
A few of the hotel's last residents looked worn and dispirited as they emerged from the damaged building with their few possessions. "This was a squandered opportunity," said Andre Stigger, a restaurant worker who has been homeless since losing his job in March. "This place could have raised people's consciousness. We could have shown the world that we're capable of lifting ourselves out of this situation."
Yet the mood was upbeat at Powderhorn Park, where dozens of volunteers and neighborhood residents worked through the day Friday to help the recent arrivals. Cheers swept through the group after they learned of the Park Board's decision to revoke the 72-hour vacate notice. The group had put out a call for provisions, including hot food, beverages and bug spray. A man with an injured knee was already getting treated in a makeshift medic tent.
On Friday, Park Board Superintendent Al Bangoura issued a statement saying he now recognized that 72 hours "is not enough time" to help people at the park find housing and other services. "Encampments represent a serious health and safety risk -- particularly for those staying within the encampment -- and do not represent a dignified form of shelter," he said. "I am committed to working with the community, local leaders and the [Minnesota] Interagency Council on Homelessness on a solution."
Still, it remains to be seen how quickly state and county officials can respond. Their resources and staffing have been stretched thin by a massive and unprecedented effort to move homeless people who are at particularly high risk for the coronavirus to area hotel rooms. To date, more than 600 homeless people have been moved to five area hotels.
Barrow was among those who pitched a tent under the trees at Powderhorn Park after a tumultuous week at the former Sheraton.
His eviction from the hotel marked the fourth time in two months he had been forced to vacate a site, and he was looking forward to a chance to connect with social workers. "I'm sick of that rock-bottom feeling, where you don't know where your next move is going to be," he said. "People here have really stepped up and made us feel welcome."

Historic pardon in Duluth lynching

Full text: DULUTH - With a gun to his head, Max Mason told a police officer he had done no wrong.
Yet the black circus worker was convicted by an all-white jury of raping a white woman in Duluth in 1920 despite no evidence a crime had occurred.
And for 100 years, the official record reflected that lie.
No more.
Mason, a "scapegoat" for a mob that lynched three innocent black men in Duluth 100 years ago Monday, has been cleared of his century-old rape conviction.
On Friday morning the Minnesota Board of Pardons granted Mason the state's first posthumous pardon.
"This is 100 years overdue," said Gov. Tim Walz, who sits on the board along with Attorney General Keith Ellison and Lorie Skjerven Gildea, chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court.
It took a unanimous vote to grant the pardon, which followed emotional testimony from those supporting it.
"His case is like the case of hundreds of other people of color," said Jerry Blackwell, the Minneapolis lawyer who drafted the pardon application. "Mr. Mason deserves our mercy, our clemency, because we served him a tainted justice when it should have been pure."
Mason was arrested and tried following the June 15, 1920, lynching of three fellow black circus workers -- Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie -- who were accused of raping a white woman, Irene Tusken. Tusken's doctor found no evidence of an assault.
In Mason's pardon application, Blackwell wrote that without "a scapegoat to exculpate the actions of the mob ... [it] would have meant that the lynch mob had not murdered rapists, but innocent men."
Mason was sentenced to 30 years in prison but was released in 1925 and told not to return to Minnesota. He died in Memphis, Tenn., in 1942 at the age of 43.
After initially making national headlines, the lynching and Mason's case quickly faded from view and was long kept quiet by Duluth leaders and residents.
Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken, whose great-aunt was the accuser, told the pardon board he only learned about his family's connection to the lynching after Irene Tusken died in 1996.
"I believe this is mostly attributed to the great shame experienced by our family and the desire to repress and forget this injustice," Tusken said. "In much the same way, Duluth followed suit."
The police chief noted, "Not only is the conviction unjust but the facts do not support an arrest in the first place." He urged the board to grant the pardon and correct "a total disregard for justice."
Rogier Gregoire, a board member with the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial in Duluth, said the pardon counters the "Minnesota Nice" approach of ignoring the injustice and dispels any lingering suggestion that the lynchings were somehow justified.
"We need to remove that from the minds of all those people in Minnesota and across the world who believe there's some thread of support for the notion that there might have been a crime," Gregoire said. "We need desperately to help those who want to abandon the racism of that fiction so his memory can be held in all of our hearts in a clear and innocent way."
The board quickly determined it had the legal authority to grant a posthumous pardon under state law and approved the pardon without objection.
During the vote, which took place remotely over a video call, the weight of the decision was evident on the faces of Tusken, Gregoire and Blackwell.
It was not just about the pardon of one man, Ellison said, but "our community."
"Racial terror is not limited to one section of our country," Ellison said. "This is part of a process of letting our country really be a place of liberty and justice for all."
A number of current and former elected officials and legal groups supported the pardon, including, in a rare move, the U.S. District Court for Minnesota.
"I have read the entire transcript of the trial of Mr. Mason, and to say that he was convicted on the flimsiest of evidence is a vast understatement," Chief Judge John R. Tunheim wrote in a letter of support for the pardon. "We can only do what we can now, and that is to try to address the injustices that can be remedied, and never, ever, forget this sad and awful history."
To commemorate the lynching, the federal courthouse in Duluth will be closed on Monday and three minutes of silence will be observed at other courthouses starting at noon.
On Friday afternoon Duluth Mayor Emily Larson apologized to Mason's family and said the decision put "a little bit of hope in the air today." The city's human rights officer, Carl Crawford, said it is a "historic time" for Duluth.
"We said for a long time that he was innocent. But now it's true. And it's entrenched. And we know it to be true," he said.
Despite a sudden timeliness with the death of George Floyd still reverberating around the world, the pardon application first came before the board in December, and Walz said it had been "decades in the making."
Still, the governor said: "There is a direct line between what happened with Max Mason and Clayton, Jackson and McGhie. There is a direct line to what happened to George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis."

Gov. Tim Walz issued a proclamation that morning to coincide with the 46-year-old's funeral service in Houston and honor other lives cut short by "systems of racism and discrimination" in the state.
But when prison administrators cleared the air for the remembrance, a voice crackled through on their radios:
"Is this for the injustice of having Derek Chauvin locked up?" the Stillwater prison guard reportedly said, referring to the veteran Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd's neck before he died on Memorial Day.
The comment was met with stunned silence. The officer who made the remark was escorted out of the prison and remains on paid leave. Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell confirmed the nature of the incident and status of the pending investigation.
Several minority officers filed complaints about the incident, describing the conduct as inappropriate.
It's unclear whether prisoners nearby overheard the exchange.
"In the interest of everyone, we made a decision to send him home," Schnell said. "Comments like that have the potential to affect the safety of the facility."
Union officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Despite the differences in their roles, many corrections officers view themselves as another critical rung of law enforcement and identify with the daily challenges police face on the job.
Chauvin is awaiting trial at Oak Park Heights prison on a second-degree murder charge in Floyd's death. It's the state's only maximum-security facility. As is common with other high-profile inmates, he is being held in administrative segregation -- meaning that he is isolated from the general population for his protection but maintains certain privileges.
In the aftermath of Floyd's death, Schnell sent an e-mail to all 4,300 corrections staff members to address the tragedy and announce his intent to hold two employee listening sessions, one specifically for minority employees.
"I would particularly like to provide space for our DOC colleagues of color to discuss and process our collective work in a system that reflects a profound disparate impact on people of color," he wrote. "These realities cannot be overlooked and their impact cannot be underestimated. Starting these conversations will not be easy, but they are profoundly necessary."

Full text: Minneapolis voters would decide in November whether to eliminate the City Charter's requirement for police staffing and replace it with a new department "to provide for community safety and violence prevention," under a proposal floated Friday by five City Council members.
The announcement comes at a time when council members are facing pressure to explain their plan to "begin the process of ending" the Minneapolis Police Department following George Floyd's death.
The council and a separate body, the Minneapolis Charter Commission, would need to work under an expedited schedule as they face a tight deadline to add items to the November ballot. The city's charter, in essence its constitution, requires the City Council to fund a minimum number of police officers.
Council Member Jeremiah Ellison said he still expects to spend a year seeking feedback from residents about how they want to change the Minneapolis Police Department, but he fears that if that charter provision isn't removed, it will hamper their efforts.
"Without it, we can't actually have an earnest yearlong conversation with community that will mean anything," Ellison said. "And by making this change, it doesn't eliminate the police. … Until we have an emergency response system that is ready to deploy, we're going to have police in its place."
Minneapolis' charter requires the City Council to "fund a police force of at least 0.0017 employees per resident, and provide for those employees' compensation." Based on the latest census data, that amounts to roughly 730 police employees. The department had 892 sworn officers and 175 non-sworn employees at the beginning of the month.
During Friday's council meeting, Ellison and four other members -- Alondra Cano, Cam Gordon, Steve Fletcher and Council President Lisa Bender -- announced plans to introduce on June 26 a plan to amend the City Charter. Their proposal would remove the police department requirement and create a new department "to provide for community safety and violence prevention."
Gordon said they have discussed possibilities but haven't yet settled on the wording of the measure. "I don't know that there is necessarily a consensus among the authors," he said.
After the proposal is introduced, they will need seven council members to vote to refer the matter to the Charter Commission. If it chooses, the commission can take several months to review the proposal.
After they receive the Charter Commission's recommendations, which are not binding, council members must then vote on whether to send the measure to the ballot. Mayor Jacob Frey would also need to approve or veto the proposal. The deadline for completing all of that this year is Aug. 21.
"The Charter Commission, to be frank, probably could sort of use their process to obstruct this action," Ellison said. "My hope is that they won't."
Barry Clegg, chair of the Charter Commission, said it was too early to tell where commission members fall on the issue, but he would be willing to convene a special meeting.
If they do not meet the deadline for getting the item on the Nov. 3 ballot, council members could try again next year to get the measure on the 2021 ballot, an idea Gordon said he is open to.
In the days following George Floyd's death, many activists called for Minneapolis to "defund" or abolish its police department, but some business groups and Frey have said they prefer changing the department over eliminating it completely. In recent days, some business owners have said they need more clarity from the City Council on its future plans before they decide whether to rebuild from the riots.
Separate from a new charter proposal, the City Council on Friday unanimously approved a resolution that declares its "intent to create a transformative new model for cultivating safety in our city." That resolution creates a work group of city staffers who are tasked with recommending policy changes for transitioning to a new approach and for seeking community input during that process.
Also Friday, the council voted to remove the requirement for off-duty officers to work at some special events, allowing organizers to use private security. And it ended the state of emergency that was declared following George Floyd's death. An earlier emergency, put in place to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, remains in effect.
Later Friday, Frey announced that he is also convening three task forces to recommend new policies. One group will involve "national partners," including the National Network for Safe Communities at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at City University of New York; Cities United; Prevention Institute; the NAACP, and the American Civil Liberties Union.
Another group will consist of local government agencies, including Hennepin County, the Hennepin County Public Defender's Office and Metro Transit Police.
A third group will consist of "community partners." More details are expected next week.

AVENUE TO A LASTING MEMORIAL

Full text: The searing images of a makeshift memorial to George Floyd, the black man who died beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer, have become iconic.
Soon, that shrine at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue may also become permanent.
City, state and community leaders are exploring ways to create a lasting tribute to Floyd at the intersection where he was killed -- and where thousands of visitors have since paused, protested and prayed -- that would remain long after the flowers and plywood paintings are cleared away.
Andrea Jenkins, Minneapolis City Council vice president, along with state Sen. Jeff Hayden and neighbors, say they want to commemorate the Memorial Day event that cost Floyd his life and fueled worldwide demands to fundamentally change policing.
"This is a conversation that is happening. There will be something memorializing George Floyd's life," said Jenkins, who represents the area.
Possibilities include a traffic roundabout, a peace garden, or perhaps a sculpture, said Jenkins, who added that she has spoken with Gov. Tim Walz and several members of Congress about the idea.
"I don't know if I can make promises right now, but I will be working to make a memorial at that site," she said. "And it will be something that is substantial. It will be more than a plaque, I'll tell you that."
Victoria Lauing, executive director of the nearby Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center, said her organization has heard of informal discussions regarding a permanent memorial.
"As an arts organization based here, we are committed to sharing our resources to support community-driven responses, whether that is a permanent memorial, or other events and activities," she said in an e-mail.
The center is willing to listen to and support whatever the community decides to do, she said.
Hayden, assistant Senate minority leader who also represents the neighborhood, said he could see a traffic circle or roundabout -- with a memorial to Floyd at the center.
While the community should help determine a memorial's exact form, he said, it's critical that Floyd's "murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer" be permanently commemorated for healing to occur.
"It's an atrocity. ... You don't want to forget it," Hayden said. "And we're destined to do it again if we don't remember it -- if we don't tell the story."
Earlier this week, as dozens of visitors quietly walked through the intersection taking pictures and capturing video, Rico Morales used duct tape to affix signs and posters both praising and mourning Floyd to the windows of Cup Foods.
Just a few feet away from the spot in front of the store where Floyd made his last gasps for air, Morales talked about a memorial that could include a community garden, a traffic circle and maybe an interactive display where visitors can learn about Floyd's life as well as his death.
Morales, who said his main job at Cup Foods is food safety manager, said he's in charge of helping make a permanent memorial a reality. It's important work, he said.
"It's important to have the longevity and the permanence of a memorial to a life that was taken by brutality and violence," he said. "Also to have a space for the community to have a place to come with your feelings, your emotions, your memories."
Until a permanent memorial is decided, Morales said, he doesn't expect the temporary tributes -- the paintings, the flowers, the brown wooden raised fist at the center of the intersection -- to be taken away anytime soon.
Nor does he expect Chicago Avenue to reopen to traffic.
"That's up to the community. That's up to the people, basically working with the city," Morales said, adding he would prefer it stay closed for as long as needed. "I mean, that would be the worst thing for the city workers or staff to do is to come in and just say, 'OK, this is over now. Your grieving and your mourning process is over now.' That's not for anybody to decide. Hopefully, that will happen naturally and organically."
Sitting nearby and holding a Black Lives Matter sign was Patricia Rogers, who has been visiting the site since Floyd was killed.
The growing makeshift memorial "brings a lot of light, a lot of life and it brings everyone together with a real feeling of peace," she said.
She would like to see a permanent memorial, maybe a "huge" statue of Floyd, perhaps something that would list the names of other black men and women killed by police.
"I would love it," Rogers said. "A lot of people do come here for peace, you know, and to pray. You get redemption. As minorities, we don't really have places that we can go and pray and reflect. They need to make Chicago 'George Floyd Avenue.' "
Less than 400 feet away from where Floyd was pinned on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind his back, Jamie LaBlanche watched his little ones.
A stay-at-home dad, LaBlanche has also taken on an unofficial role as neighborhood guide to the countless visitors to the site over the past two-plus weeks.
"Being that I'm a person of color as well, I have been out in the community letting people see my face, making sure they feel welcome," he said. "I've talked to rural white people from 45 minutes past Brainerd who came down here to see what it was like."
Although the constant traffic and noise from crowds of visitors and protesters has meant only a few hours of uninterrupted sleep at night, LaBlanche said the peace the memorial has brought to the neighborhood has made it worth it. He hopes, too, that the site becomes home to a lasting monument -- it's been that important to helping spread understanding, he said.
"Honestly, before this happened, we were looking at moving," he said. "But now? I think I need to be here. And I think [a permanent memorial] would be really good for the community."

St. Paul to dismiss some cases following Floyd's death: Those cited for property damage and other offenses may be offered alternatives.

Full text: The St. Paul City Attorney's Office will dismiss cases against people who protested peacefully following George Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer and will offer alternatives to traditional prosecution to others.
The office is reviewing nearly 100 cases, including 87 curfew violations, City Attorney Lyndsey Olson said Friday. While some cases involve other crimes, such as property damage, none are arsons, she said.
"The City Attorney's Office will make charging decisions on a case-by-case basis and proceed with traditional prosecution when deemed necessary," Olson said. "The approach to review and charging on these cases is not unique -- rather, it's an example of our whole commitment to stewarding just outcomes in prosecution."
The office makes charging decisions for all cases on an individualized basis and has a restorative justice program for first-time, nonviolent offenders already in place.
The office may give those facing charges the opportunity to participate in the ETHOS program, which would involve talking to people in their neighborhood and developing a plan to remedy the harm caused, Olson said.
"One of the saddest parts of all of this is just how historically unsurprising George Floyd's murder is," Mayor Melvin Carter said as he stood alongside Olson at a City Hall news conference Friday afternoon.
"As my children have shared with me, it shouldn't be surprising to anyone that people have been as angry as they have been."
As he has throughout the aftermath of the protests that spread across the Twin Cities in recent weeks, Carter drew a distinction between "those voices of peaceful protest [that] have challenged and renewed our country's spirit in every single generation" and violence against people and property.
"I fully support City Attorney Olson's planned approach and appreciate that critical distinction ... between those who sought to build a better future and those who tried to tear us down," he said.

Officers condemn Chauvin, salute chief

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 6/13/2020: This story incorrectly attributed criticism of Mayor Jacob Frey at a news conference to an entire group of activists and community faith leaders. Not everyone held the same position and the faith leaders said they support Frey. Several Minneapolis police officers issued a public letter Thursday condemning the killing of George Floyd, embracing Chief Medaria Arradondo and vowing to work toward regaining public trust.
The letter, obtained by the Star Tribune, begins, "Dear Everyone -- but especially Minneapolis citizens," and says it represents how the "vast majority" of Minneapolis police officers feel.
"We want to work with you and for you to regain your trust," it read, while also making clear that the letter is not representative of the Police Officers' Federation of Minneapolis, with which Arradondo said Wednesday that he was halting contract negotiations.
The writers "wholeheartedly condemn" fired officer Derek Chauvin, who is in jail awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge in Floyd's death. Chauvin was captured on video pressing his knee into Floyd's neck on a south Minneapolis street on May 25 as Floyd pleaded for breath before losing consciousness. Two other officers, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, held Floyd down, and a third, Tou Thao, kept onlookers at bay. They were also fired and are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
"Like us, Derek Chauvin took an oath to hold the sanctity of life most precious," the officers wrote. "Derek Chauvin failed as a human and stripped George Floyd of his dignity and life. This is not who we are."
The four officers involved in Floyd's death were fired by Arradondo the next day. The crime ignited days of protests and led to the current movement to defund or disband the Minneapolis Police Department. Mayor Jacob Frey has said he supports reforms in the department, not a wholesale deconstruction, while nine members of the City Council have said they want to "begin the process of ending" the department.
The letter writers declined further comment, saying the letter speaks for itself. But their action marked a rare example of officers taking a stand outside their ranks.
The signees include some of the department's most prominent and respected officers, including Cmdr. Charlie Adams, who now runs its community engagement efforts.
Lt. Mark Klukow, who now works in the First Precinct in downtown Minneapolis, provided security for former Mayor R.T. Rybak, as did officer Mike Kirchen. The two also worked as "Bike Cops for Kids" for years in north Minneapolis, delivering donated bicycles to children and taking them to Twins games.
Other names on the letter are Lt. Rick Zimmerman, who runs the homicide unit, and Sgt. Darcy Klund, who commands the First Precinct community response team, two of the most experienced homicide investigators in the past three decades. John Delmonico, the former head of the union that represents the police, also was a signee.
"We are leaders, formal and informal, and from all ranks within the Minneapolis Police Department," the letter said. "We're not the union or the administration. We are officers who represent the voices of hundreds of other Minneapolis Police Officers. Hundreds. We acknowledge that Chief Arradondo needs each of us to dutifully follow him while he shows us the way."
The others who signed the letter include officers Christie Nelson, Nick Torborg, Pete Stanton, Gary Nelson, Rich Jackson, Mohamed Abdullahi, Molly Fischer and Steve McCarty.
Also Thursday, a group of community civil rights activists expressed support for Arradondo and slammed Frey and the City Council for what the activists called political grandstanding on national media.
The group of more than two dozen, led by Nekima Levy Armstrong and the Rev. Brian Herron, also called for the police union to prove it's on the side of public safety by ousting elected union chief Bob Kroll.
Levy Armstrong said council members who called for disbanding or defunding the police are trying to make political points without offering specific proposals. None of the activists was informed or consulted about the ideas before nine council members endorsed them last weekend, she said.
"They're usurping the will of the people by jumping so far ahead without actually" consulting activists, Levy Armstrong said.
Arradondo, however, immediately fired the four officers involved in Floyd's death and moved to sever discussions with the union, she said.
After the news conference, some members of the group were upstairs in a large conference room talking candidly to Frey about wanting to be involved in community building, bringing in jobs and keeping out crime.
"No one's attacking you, but we're at you because you're the man," said Alfonzo Willis, a contractor who lives in the city. "The world is watching; we need to send the right message."
V.J. Smith, president of the Minneapolis Chapter of MAD DADS, a nonprofit that fights drug abuse and social destruction, said the right people are present and willing to do the work, but they also need access to good jobs with benefits and help from the city. "We have the greatest opportunity, mayor, to change the community," he said.
Frey listened intently and thanked everyone for their leadership and commitment. "As we move forward, it will be black voices, it will be your voices, at the center of this change," he said.
Later Thursday, several hundred people gathered at a rally outside the Hennepin County Government Center. Wearing masks and holding signs, the crowd listened as speakers took the stage for more than an hour.
Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said a year is too long to wait to reform the Police Department -- an allusion to City Council President Lisa Bender saying a pledge to begin the process was the start of a "yearlong conversation."
"We're not waiting a year for justice," Gross said. "There are things they could have been doing all along the way."
"Now is not the time to be quiet," said Minneapolis NAACP President Leslie Redmond. "Now it's time to get loud. It's time to represent. Now is the time to activate like we've never activated before."

"For the refugee population, witnessing police brutality and torture at the hands of an authority figure in broad daylight is going to be extraordinarily triggering," said Jill Davidson, a social worker with the Center for Victims of Torture. "This was something they thought they left behind."
Davidson said Minnesota, with its large refugee population, is home to an estimated 50,000 victims of torture -- which typically occurred at the hands of a police officer or other authority figures. For her clients, "this [George Floyd] situation has caused a significant setback for, I would say, the majority of them."
They have been hurt physically or psychologically, sexually assaulted or had food and medical care withheld. Watching Floyd struggle to breathe churned up memories of similar experiences, she said.
Even if not torture victims, many refugees carry trauma from seeing conflict firsthand.
Siyad Farah, 90, was born in northern Somalia and grew up in Mogadishu. He came to the U.S. in 1999, fleeing war, and now lives near Minneapolis' Third Precinct police station.
When the rioting started, "The first thing I thought that was going to happen was a civil war," he said through an interpreter. Previously, he thought American police had the best training in the world, but watching the video of Floyd's last moments changed Farah's mind. Floyd's death looked like terrorism, he said, and reminded him of how feared police were in Somalia.
To cope, Farah has been reading the Qur'an and working to stay busy. "I hope things change," he said.
The blaring sirens, the smell of burning buildings and the sight of the National Guard patrolling the streets has been traumatic for first-generation Somalis, who experienced similar scenes during that country's civil war.
"They were like, 'We can't believe it. This is America,' " said Fartun Weli, executive director of Isuroon, a nonprofit that helps Somali-American women and families.
While Weli was "freaking out" during the protests and the riots, many Somali elders were "incredibly calm," she said. Then she realized why.
"I was like, 'Oh, they are in that survival mode where everything is shut down,' " she said. For a refugee, it's an everyday instinct, she added.
Suud Olat, 29, grew up in a Kenyan refugee camp and has been in the U.S. for eight years. He's running for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council and has heard some Somali-American community members wonder if they will now have to flee their new home.
"They are asking, 'What is going to happen now?' " he said. "The emotional part is that this is in our neighborhood. That's shocked us and taken a big emotional toll."
When a person is reminded of past trauma, "even if a person is not in immediate danger, their body responds as if they are," Davidson explained. Cognitive functioning turns off and a "flight, fight or freeze" response sets in.
They are afraid to go to work or leave the house and are suddenly fearful of police, she said. Some are having intrusive thoughts, trouble sleeping or waking from nightmares. Others can't stop crying.
Compounding the problem, some lost access to basics like grocery stores and pharmacies when stores burned down or were looted, Davidson said.
When mayhem erupted on St. Paul's University Avenue after Floyd's death, many Hmong-American farmers were driving home from farm fields in rural areas. Most are in their 60s or 70s and have vivid memories of the Vietnam War. Others in the Hmong community tried to alert them to what was happening so they wouldn't have to see it.
"They escaped a war-torn country to come to America," said Bao Vang, executive director and CEO of the Hmong American Partnership. "They didn't expect that the looting, the rioting would happen in broad daylight with no police presence."
What they saw in St. Paul reminded them of being "hunted and persecuted" in Laos and Thailand, she said. Some took refuge at the suburban home of a family member. Others got back to their house, locked the door and lay awake all night. Still others froze up, focusing only on survival.
The Center for Victims of Torture teaches its clients strategies to calm themselves if they see or hear something that retraumatizes them. They may try to focus intently on one thing, such as a tree or bird outside their window, to ground themselves in the present. Medicine can help, especially if sleep is an issue, Davidson said.
"I am just amazed every day at the resilience of the people we're working with … and how they still manage to find a way," she said. "Our community has a lot to learn from them."
Out of tragedy, Weli said, she sees hopeful signs in the Somali community. Many young people now want to register to vote or learn how to organize their communities. Others hope to become citizens. "Even though it's really a hard time, I also see opportunities for the community to become more politically active, with intention," she said.

Baker is reappointed as Hennepin County's chief medical examiner: One commissioner raised concerns about his autopsy of George Floyd.

Full text: The Hennepin County Board reappointed Dr. Andrew Baker as the county's chief medical examiner, despite some controversy over his recent autopsy report on George Floyd.
Commissioners on Thursday voted 5-2 to reappoint Baker, replaying a committee vote taken by the same margin Tuesday. One of the dissenters, Commissioner Angela Conley, had raised concerns that the autopsy report -- which ruled Floyd's death a homicide -- mentioned fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, which she suggested downgraded the severity of the crime. The other vote against Baker came from Commissioner Irene Fernando.
"Everybody is watching this case like a hawk," said Conley. "Institutional racism is embedded in all levels of government. Once again, we have to understand why people don't trust this system and the process."
Floyd, a black man, died May 25 at the hands of Minneapolis police. Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, restrained Floyd for more than eight minutes and has been charged with second-degree murder.
Other commissioners, including Mike Opat, said it was misleading to say that listing Floyd's toxicology results in the autopsy report damaged the public trust.
"Toxicology is often listed in autopsy reports," he said. "It's obvious Floyd died by the hands of Officer Chauvin. I believe in Baker as a leader."
Baker has been the county's chief medical examiner since he was first appointed in 2004. The National Association of Medical Examiners, of which Baker has served as president, released a statement Thursday calling him "one of the most highly regarded and esteemed forensic pathologists in the United States ... known for his expertise and integrity." Listing drug intoxication in the autopsy report "provides a more comprehensive statement of the cause of death," the statement said.
In other action, the board approved funding for several projects related to COVID-19, including:
• $3.5 million to encourage absentee voting amid the pandemic;
• $1.7 million for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing at long-term care facilities and in neighborhoods disproportionately hurt by the virus;
• $1.5 million for distance learning for children involved with the county;
• $1 million for summer youth programs and organized sports.
Funding came from more than $93 million in federal money designated for COVID-19 projects.
The board also passed a resolution supporting state, regional and local efforts to secure state and federal aid for emergency protective measures relating to civil unrest and for disaster relief for properties that were damaged during the unrest following Floyd's death.

Post offices burned in Floyd riots leave void: Neighbors miss branches on Lake Street, Minnehaha.

Full text: As fire consumed dozens of businesses along E. Street in the unrest following the death of George Floyd, the Minnehaha and Lake Street post offices were reduced to gaping, charred hulks.
Now the United States Postal Service (USPS) is "exploring many options" to re-establish itself in the south Minneapolis neighborhoods affected by the recent fires and looting.
"We are already moving forward to provide customers a local facility to call their own," said Nicole Hill, a USPS spokeswoman, in an e-mail. "It is too early in the process to provide a timeline."
But the simple scrawl on the remains of the Minnehaha post office seemed to reflect the neighbors' views: "Rebuild!!!"
"Tears came to my eyes when I watched [the Lake Street] post office go down in flames," said Tiwanna Jackson, president of Tweak The Glam Studio, a small beauty business at Lake and Lyndale Avenue. "The whole community is crushed."
Jackson said she stopped by the Lake Street station every week to retrieve mail for her business, which was damaged by looting. "They need to bring it back," she said.
The 43-year-old Lake Street facility, which is owned by the USPS, spanned 80,000 square feet on nearly two acres of land at 110 E. 31st St. near Lake and Nicollet Avenue, according to Hennepin County property records. Because it is a federal property, no market value is listed.
The Minnehaha post office at 3033 S. 27th Av., built off
Minnehaha Avenue on nearly an acre in 1970, is owned by a Bloomington-based limited liability corporation and leased by the postal service. Its market value is just over $1 million, county records state.
Local residents and business owners say the post offices not only provided a critical lifeline, they served as an impromptu meeting place for neighbors.
"The post office is part of the fabric of the community," said Jane Aldrich, a Longfellow neighborhood resident who used the Minnehaha facility frequently, especially to send care packages to family.
Aldrich said she knows many of the postal clerks by name. "The post office is a great leveler. Everyone uses it and it's so representative of our community," she said.
That being said, she added: "Buildings can be replaced. George Floyd cannot."
As the community continues to recover from the unrest, mail delivery that lapsed on May 28 was restored by June 1, Hill said.
"We are happy to report that all of our customers are receiving mail to their homes and businesses," Minneapolis Postmaster William Jones said in a statement.
For the time being, mail service for the Minnehaha facility has been redirected to the downtown Minneapolis post office. Lake Street post office patrons should go to the Loring Park station on the western edge of downtown.
The Postal Inspection Service is investigating looting and fires at both facilities, a federal crime that could result in severe penalties should the perpetrators be charged.
About 70 employees worked out of both post offices, but no one was present or injured as the fires raged, said Brad Sandberg, president of Local 125 of the American Postal Workers Union in Minneapolis. Employees are now working in other facilities, he said.
Both post offices were very busy, he said. Several hundred P.O. boxes in the buildings were destroyed, too.
"Especially with COVID, a lot of people running small businesses went online to sell their products to survive," he said. "People would be in line with armfuls of boxes. They were so thankful we remained open."
Hill said the bulk of the deliveries had been made from both locations before the fires, though some mail and packages were damaged. "Due to the ongoing investigation, we are unable to address specific volume," she said. But if customers believe they are missing mail or packages, she said, they should contact the sender.
A third post office in the Lake Street vicinity, the Powderhorn station at 3045 Bloomington Av., sustained some damage but reopened Tuesday.
"We were very lucky," said Eduardo Barrera, manager of nearby Mercado Central on Lake Street. "The post office provides a critical service."
While other post offices nationwide were damaged in the riots and looting that followed Floyd's death, none were burned as extensively as those in Minneapolis, Hill said.
As the community rebuilds, the memory of the post offices lingers. Someone spray-painted on a partial brick wall left standing at the Lake Street post office: "We [heart] our postal patrons! We will be back to serve you!"

Teen is lauded for George Floyd video: Chief Medaria Arradondo praised her quick thinking.

Full text: The Minneapolis teenager whose video opened the world's eyes to the death of George Floyd wasn't looking to be a hero when she coolly documented 10 minutes of history unfolding before her eyes, her lawyer said Thursday.
"She had no idea she would witness and document one of the most important and high-profile police murders in American history," Darnella Frazier's attorney, Seth Cobin, said. "If it wasn't for her bravery, presence of mind, and steady hand, and her willingness to post the video on Facebook and share her trauma with the world, all four of those police officers would still be on the streets, possibly terrorizing other members of the community."
Cobin said Frazier wasn't looking to be a hero but is "just a 17-year-old high school student, with a boyfriend and a job at the mall, who did the right thing. She's the Rosa Parks of her generation."
The imagery of the white officer's arrest of an unarmed and handcuffed black man played a crucial role in Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin being charged with murder and manslaughter, as well as three officers who were with him being charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All were quickly fired.
Frazier is not ready to speak publicly about her role in telling the story of Floyd's death beyond what she told the Star Tribune the next day. "The world needed to see what I was seeing," she said. "Stuff like this happens in silence too many times."
The benefits of Frazier's quick thinking drew praise and gratitude from Police Chief Medaria Arradondo during a nationally telecast news conference Thursday.
While "we should never have to rely upon" witness video to keep police accountable, the chief said, "I am thankful, absolutely, that this was captured in the manner that it was."
He went on to encourage others to do the same when confronted with such a scene involving officers' actions.
"Record. Record, absolutely," Arradondo said. "Record, call. Call a friend. Yell out. Call 911. We need a supervisor to the scene. Absolutely. I need to know that. We need to know that. So the community plays a vital role and did two weeks ago."
In the moments before Frazier found herself feet from where Floyd was being pinned to the pavement, her 9-year-old cousin asked to go from the family's apartment to nearby Cup Foods at the intersection that now serves as a shrine to the 46-year-old native of Houston.
"When she was a few storefronts from the shop," Cobin said, "she saw four officers roughly removing a black motorist from his vehicle. Because police brutality is so common in that neighborhood, and the officers rarely face consequences, she pulled out her iPhone and started recording."
Frazier is "doing well in terms of her outlook and attitude," said Cobin, who is based in Minneapolis. "She's staying positive and avoiding the drama on social media."
Cobin said Frazier "hasn't received threats or anything like that" but acknowledged she's been the target of "trash talking and 'shade' " on social media since her cellphone video May 25 showed Chauvin using his knee to pin Floyd to the pavement at the intersection of E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue.
Many people have been inquiring about how to help Frazier and say thank you for her role in the saga.
Cobin verified the legitimacy of a GoFundMe page that has been established by two women who previously had no connection to Frazier. They wrote that the teenager "deserves peace and healing [as] she has had to deal with trolls, bullies and ignorant people harassing her online."

sentiment runs against disbanding police: Small-business owners are wary of the radical notion favored by Minneapolis City Council members.

Full text: Small-business owners in Minneapolis who lost everything in the riots don't want to lose their police department, too. But nobody thinks it should be business as usual, either.
That view is shared by large and small companies, according to an informal survey conducted by the Star Tribune, which asked dozens of business owners if they support the recent pledge by a City Council majority to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department in response to public furor over the death of George Floyd.
"What I feel in my heart, and what millions of people feel, is that there is a young girl without a dad who should still be on the planet," said restaurant owner Charles Stotts, whose Town Talk Diner & Gastropub was destroyed in the riots. "There needs to be a fix to this, whatever that fix is."
Jonathan Weinhagen, president & CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber, said the group's members believe the city must reach out to "communities of color" and deliver "significant reform" to the department. After years of complaints, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights recently launched an investigation of the police department to determine if its officers have engaged in discriminatory practices toward people of color.
"We stand with Chief [Medaria] Arradondo and his efforts to hold officers accountable and dramatically overhaul policing in Minneapolis," Weinhagen said in a statement. "Businesses are
concerned about calls for abolishing or eliminating the police department. We believe it is important to maintain and improve public safety. And the necessary changes for the MPD will take consensus from the community and continual work from leaders across Minneapolis."
The business community was rattled when nine of 12 seated council members told protesters in Powerderhorn Park on Sunday that they will soon "begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department." The announcement came one day after Mayor Jacob Frey told a crowd of protesters he does not support abolishing the MPD.
"We recognize that we don't have all the answers about what a police-free future looks like, but our community does," the council members said in a joint statement. "We're committed to engaging with every willing community member in the City of Minneapolis over the next year to identify what safety looks like for you."
The nine members offered no details on the proposal, but some business owners seized on the phrase "police-free."
"I was already kind of fed up with a lot of the lunatic ideas that have come out of the City Council, even before this," said Don Blyly, who is facing $2 million in losses from the destruction of Uncle Hugo's and Uncle Edgar's bookstores on Chicago Avenue. "The police department needs to be fixed. But if they do the kind of things they are talking about now, then I will not rebuild in the city of Minneapolis."
The council's lack of specifics is infuriating to many business owners, some of whom accused the council of pandering to the mob.
"They are just looking to please some people," said Khaled Aloul, owner of two GM Tobacco stores that were heavily damaged during the riots. "We don't even know what it means: dismantle the police department."
Like other business owners, Aloul was frustrated when he turned to the police for help during the riots. After looters broke into his store on Lake Street, he said he spotted several officers and asked for help.
"They said we have instructions from the mayor not to interfere," said Aloul, who lost an estimated $800,000 in tobacco products to looters. "I understand they were overwhelmed, but I think if they had fired off a couple of shots they could have scared people off."
Despite the experience, Aloul doesn't like the idea of disbanding the department.
"How do you know the new thing is going to be better?" he asked. "Can you imagine a town without police? Look at what happened when the police didn't come. The whole area is a disaster. It looks like we had a civil war here."
Some business owners said they would like to see the department relinquish some duties to others, such as dealing with mentally ill individuals or the homeless. The Minneapolis Downtown Council has recommended that mental health professionals "co-respond" to police calls involving emotionally distraught residents.
Some business owners believe that violent outcomes could be avoided if police were better trained. In Floyd's case, things spiraled out of control when officers responded to a complaint that Floyd passed a counterfeit $20 bill, a minor crime. The Minnesota Business Partnership, which represents some of the largest companies in the Twin Cities, has called for increased training on "interactions with African Americans and people of color."
"Getting rid of crime fighters won't eliminate crime," said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Partnership, whose members include U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and the Star Tribune. "So we support that crime fighters get good training and that they be held accountable if they exceed the rules."
The partnership is asking state lawmakers to make it easier to get rid of problem cops, including the repeal of laws requiring binding arbitration for law enforcement officers accused of misconduct. The group also is calling for a change in collective bargaining rules that impede discipline of officers who "seriously betray the public trust."
That doesn't go far enough for some business owners.
"I definitely want the city to defund them and start over," said Ray James, whose Fade Factory Barber Shop on West Broadway was destroyed during the rioting. "I think we need to start letting people from our community police our own community, because we all love each other and we kind of know the problem people. And sometimes, problem people ain't really problem people."

Full text: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz laid out a wide-ranging overhaul of law enforcement Thursday as lawmakers return to the State Capitol for a special session shadowed by the memory of George Floyd, a black man who died in the hands of Minneapolis police.
Walz, accompanied by DFL leaders, challenged the Legislature to meet calls for action sparked by his death and the protests in Minnesota and across the nation. The DFL plan would reform use-of-force standards, increase oversight of police discipline and encourage community-based alternatives to traditional law enforcement.
But addressing racial inequities in policing will be only a part of the complex and fast-paced work of the Legislature that convenes Friday, as lawmakers forge ahead on a list of unfinished business left behind when they wrapped up the regular session in May.
Topping the list is a massive public works borrowing bill that fell apart amid partisan sniping over Walz's emergency powers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Walz's declaration of another 30-day extension of those powers -- the act which
triggered the special session -- remains a potential roadblock as lawmakers in both parties seek to attach conditions to a public works bonding package expected to top $1 billion.
Lawmakers also need to agree on distributing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance to local units of government from the CARES Act, one of the last major initiatives of Congress before Floyd's death turned the nation's attention from the pandemic to issues of race and police behavior.
Legislators expect to pass a tax relief measure and grants to help businesses recover from the shutdowns prompted by the pandemic. And there are discussions about helping Minneapolis and St. Paul recover from the damage wrought by several days of violent protests following Floyd's death.
While the pandemic dominated the closing days of the regular session, the mood of the state and the nation has changed palpably since Floyd's death on Memorial Day, with swelling demand for state leaders to reform police practices with regard to people of color.
"This call to a special session is not a call just from me. It's that primal scream you heard from people on the streets demanding justice, demanding it now and demanding us step into this moment," Walz said Wednesday as he announced the new session.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have proposed changes, though it is unclear how much common ground may emerge. Amid a fast-changing political landscape, legislative leaders say they could pass some changes in the next week or two, and they plan to dive into more in-depth measures after that.
GOP Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said last week that he thought criminal justice changes need to be vetted and should not be made too quickly. But this week he said he has had many conversations on the topic and changed his mind.
He said he now believes Republicans could agree to ban chokeholds, eliminate binding arbitration for public employees, put the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in charge of investigating use-of-force cases and make it the duty of officers to intervene and report unauthorized use of force.
There seems to be bipartisan support for some of those proposals, though a couple of public employee unions that largely support Democrats have said they oppose ending binding arbitration.
Walz and a group of DFL leaders laid out more details on their police accountability and reform plans Thursday, saying the world is watching and legislators need to capitalize on the moment to change state laws. Some of their key measures would change the standards for use of deadly force, mandate more training, enhance the power of the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Board and make the board more diverse. The plan would specifically ban "warrior style" police training backed by the Minneapolis police union.
House Republicans criticized aspects of the plan Thursday for not eliminating binding arbitration and for adding felon voting rights into the mix.
Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, DFL-Roseville, called felon voting rights a key part of the DFL plan. "Giving folks the ability to vote is the most core thing we could possibly do right now to give folks a voice in what their government is doing and how we move forward," she said.
House Speaker Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, said legislators are gathering community input to identify short-, medium- and long-term priorities. In all, the Democratic-controlled House plans to introduce about 20 bills related to criminal justice reform.
DFL Rep. Carlos Mariani, chairman of the House public safety and criminal justice reform committee, believes increasing POST Board diversity is one of the changes that could happen quickly. He said the office of Attorney General Keith Ellison could quickly be made the default organization to prosecute police-involved deaths, instead of county attorney offices.
Gazelka said county attorneys have raised concerns with that, and he opposes the idea. Gazelka also said he opposes any effort to defund police, an idea raised by Black Lives Matter activists and a majority of Minneapolis City Council members.
It remains unclear whether the push for police reform will be tied politically to other bills. The infrastructure bonding bill requires a supermajority to pass, making it one of the few points of leverage for the minority party in each legislative chamber. House GOP leaders sought to tie the bonding bill to an end to Walz's emergency powers during the regular session in May.
Republican House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown, said while he still opposes the extension of the powers, he is "very willing to be flexible" on a bonding bill during the special session. His caucus wants to see a borrowing package that includes important projects that would spur economic growth during the coronavirus outbreak, Daudt said. But he also said Republicans have "grave concerns about increasing our spending during a time of deficit."
Since Floyd's death, Sen. Jeff Hayden, the assistant DFL minority leader in the Senate, has talked about linking the bonding bill to police reform instead. "If it's up to me, you're not going to get our votes for a bonding bill until we pass significant law enforcement reforms," he said.
But DFL leaders such as Hortman and Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury, have not taken that hard of a line. The House's People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, which is leading the DFL work on police reforms, is not talking about holding up bonding right now, Mariani said. He described blocking the bonding bill as pulling "a nuclear switch."
The debate over the bonding bill also is playing out against the backdrop of a projected $2.4 billion budget deficit. Daudt said if the Legislature agrees to new spending during the special session, such as additional debt payments for a bonding bill, the costs should be offset by state budget cuts.
The special session, anticipated since May 18, has taken on new urgency since the protests after Floyd's death. State general obligation bonding could include money for a library and career development center damaged during protests, Hortman said. But state leaders are discussing a separate appropriations bonding bill to help private businesses. The time frame to get all this work done remained unclear. Gazelka said they could finish the bills they agree on in less than a week, then other items could take all summer. But he said, "I don't see being in session unless we agree."
Hortman said she doesn't think they should leave until their work is done.
Every time Walz opts to extend his emergency powers for another 30 days, he needs to call the Legislature back into session. So even if lawmakers do end the session quickly, they could be back in a month.
"I anticipate that this is going to be a summer where we're pretty much in session," Walz said this week.

Musicians plugged into the tumult

Author: Riemenschneider, Chris

Full text: One was arrested while manning a first aid station for protesters. Another went on CNN and CNBC to talk about his troubled city and his legendary bar.
One sang at the memorial service for the man whose death sparked international cries for justice. And another did what musicians do best: use their talent to try to make a difference in the world.
These are just some of the many Twin Cities musicians heavily involved in the crises that overtook their hometowns over the past 2 ½ weeks, starting with the May 25 death of George Floyd while in police custody through the protests and riots that followed.
We spoke to these vital scene makers about their experiences at this historic time, as well as their thoughts on what the Minnesota music community can do to bring about positive change.
Matt 'Nur-D' Allen
The arrested first-aid provider
The Rosemount-reared, comic-book-loving rapper, 29, spent four long days and nights after Floyd's death providing first-aid care, supplies and water to protesters around south Minneapolis. He had no prior medical training; he just happened upon a station abandoned by trained medics the first night and "just did what we could from there."
They formed the Justice Frontline Aid Crew and enlisted support from Modist Brewing and other donors to provide aid and supplies over the next few days. On the fifth night, June 1, Allen and other members of his team were arrested near the State Capitol just after 10 p.m. for breaking curfew. He is awaiting a court date and expecting a $1,000 fine.
Looking back: "Me and my team saw things I don't think any of us will ever forget. The chemical eye damage from tear gas was horrible, people coming in with red, ripped-up eyes. We saw a girl who got hit in the face with a rubber bullet; her teeth were broken and she was spitting out bits of teeth.
"On Saturday, the scariest day, the police came through and fired on our medic station deliberately. One girl got hit with a rubber bullet at point-blank range, and our nurses had to try to save her eye and face in the basement of a home by cellphone light. We couldn't go anywhere because we would've been arrested. Anytime we called for an ambulance they wouldn't send one.
"As the curfew neared [that Monday], my team and I made the decision to stay with the protesters because we had seen in prior events that the police were using extreme force to silence every kind of protest. Just after 10 p.m., there were maybe 50 kids seated on the Capitol grounds singing 'Stand by Me.' This militarylike police force surrounds them in full riot gear, lights blazing, jumping out of the bushes and all that. We were blessed that violence didn't occur, but we felt like we had to be there if it did."
Going forward: "Justice Frontline Aid is transitioning into more food-shelf service, taking donations and distributing them. But we know there are going to be more protests, and we want to be ready. If not for George Floyd, there will probably be something else that triggers more protests.
"COVID had already given the music community a sucker punch in the gut, and this has kind of been another thing. We all want to help, but there are other things standing in our way. This would normally be the time musicians are throwing benefit concerts and special events. In the meantime, I'd like to see more musicians who are more established than I am take a more vocal and financial stance toward these communities as they rebuild."
Dua Saleh
The musical activist
Not surprisingly, the Sudan-born, St. Paul-raised rapper/singer/poet already had a song in the can related to police brutality. Just five days after Floyd's death, Saleh released the haunting track "body cast" as a stand-alone single to benefit the Minneapolis-based Black Visions Collective.
"There were already eyes on me prior to this, and on Minneapolis as a hub for transformative work and transformative artists," said Saleh, a nonbinary performer, citing write-ups for the song already from Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and even the Grammys website. "We didn't solicit any of it. I think that tells you how all eyes really are on Minneapolis right now."
Looking back: "I wrote 'body cast' in 2019. Like many of us in Minneapolis and St. Paul, I was still processing the murders of both Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, so I wrote it with them in mind. After [the Floyd tragedy], I just felt like I wanted to do something with the platform I've been given, and music is where I have the most visibility.
"So my idea was to release that song and put all the money toward Black Visions Collective, which is mobilizing around defunding MPD because of the violence they have enacted in the community and the murders they have committed. Alec Ness and Psymun [engineer and producer] worked together to master the song quickly. We are all community members, and we care about the black community in Minneapolis, so we wanted to get this out there fast."
Going forward: "I'm not going to lie, I feel kind of vulnerable about the media attention. There are many other people and artists that are working on the front lines that deserve attention. But I understand because of my higher visibility the media pays attention to me, and I want to use that to benefit the community.
"I'm also going to train to be a medic to help at protests. That'll be how I can contribute immediately. I'll learn things like CPR, bandaging, removing tear gas from people's eyes. I understand in doing that, I'll be at risk of being arrested or shot at with tear gas or rubber bullets, but I'm preparing my body and soul for that."
Tiwana Porter
The memorial singer
Porter arrived in Minneapolis just two years ago from Sacramento, Calif. Her husband, the Rev. Ellington Porter, is a professor at North Central University, where Floyd's memorial was helmed by the Rev. Al Sharpton on June 4. She had also previously worked with Sharpton's National Action Network.
Between those two connections, she earned what she called "an incredible honor" to sing "Amazing Grace" at the service alongside Darnell Davis & the Remnant (with whom she regularly performs around town). Surprisingly, she had endured neck surgery just two days earlier at the Mayo Clinic.
Looking back: "[The surgery] just added to it being a bittersweet moment full a lot of emotions. I still had a big bandage on the back of my neck. So I was careful, somber and nervous all at the same time. That song is like a national hymn to me, so I wasn't so nervous about singing it. My focus was more wanting people to be uplifted.
"My prayer was that it would bring hope and a sense of peace to everyone -- not just his family, but everyone who'd felt pain and heartbroken over the past week. So much has happened since he was murdered, I wanted to let God's light shine through me to heal that pain."
Going forward: "The music community really has a powerful tool we can use to bring people together across racial lines, whatever kind of music it is. I truly believe there is healing power in music. I've seen it firsthand singing to Alzheimer's patients and others with medical needs. We're all hurting in one way or another. Music is one of God's gifts to heal us."
Tony Zaccardi
The bar owner
Already well known around town after years of playing bass in Romantica, Eleganza!, Kruddler and other bands, Zaccardi became even more of a local institution after buying the West Bank watering hole Palmer's Bar in 2018. He's still happy he made the leap, even after having to board up the place and worry about its destruction during the riots. He gained national media attention after he spray-painted "Black Owned Business" on the plywood over his windows.
Looking back: "I just threw that message up quick and didn't think much about it. It just seemed like maybe one little thing that might help protect the place. I painted it before I knew neo-Nazis were part of the mix. Once I learned that, I thought, 'Oh, great, I painted a bull's-eye on the place!'
"And then it kind of went viral, starting with Newsweek, then CNN, then CNBC. I'm not much of a spokesman for anything, but I figured if I was going to be handed this platform, then I should definitely try to make something positive out of it and help my community.
"Hell, yeah, I'm in support of the protesters, but not at the cost of somebody's dream. Seeing a building like Minnehaha Liquor destroyed -- which had been in that family for decades -- that place was somebody's dream. I certainly didn't want to see Palmer's destroyed. This place is my dream come true now."
Going forward: "I know so many people in bands who want to help. They'd be throwing up benefit concerts left and right, but nobody can do that because of the coronavirus. In the meantime, my biggest hope is some of the best songs of our generation come out of this.
"It really feels like we're in the middle of the biggest civil rights movement since the '60s, and our city is at the center of it. For me to be on CNN and CNBC just shows that's the case. These issues are back at the forefront, and we're seeing the best and worst of people at the moment.
"With the amount of people I'm seeing who are trying to make things right, trying to help each other and the community, I think we're mostly seeing the good in people here."

Vikings unveil social justice plan: Team to make $5 million commitment to fight racism

Author: Goessling, Ben

Full text: The Vikings unveiled plans to increase social justice work in the Twin Cities on Wednesday, with a scholarship in George Floyd's name and a $5 million commitment from ownership to fight racism and inequality.
The Vikings' three-year-old social justice committee, led by co-defensive coordinator Andre Patterson and a half-dozen players, established the George Floyd Legacy Scholarship with a $125,000 gift in the days after police killed Floyd in south Minneapolis. The endowment is expected to generate $5,000 annually for a black Twin Cities high school graduate pursuing post-secondary education.
The committee distributed $250,000 to organizations around the metro area in both 2018 and 2019 after gifts from the Wilf family. This year, it will help Vikings ownership make decisions about how to use the $5 million donation across the U.S.
"When the tragedy happened a couple of weeks ago it was real easy for [General Manager] Rick [Spielman] and I to get the committee together, and they were very strong with, 'How can we help?' " Patterson said Wednesday. "And what they wanted to do was find a way to help his family or put something together so he would always be remembered. And so one of the things they brought up was trying to put a scholarship together in George Floyd's name. It only took one week and the Vikings came together and got that done."
In an 83-minute conference call Wednesday, Vikings players and executives told emotional stories about their own experiences with systemic racism
and shared candid thoughts on how the NFL can drive change on issues ranging from food insecurity to education and criminal justice reform.
Linebacker Eric Kendricks, who challenged the NFL to take action with a series of June 2 tweets and appeared with teammate Anthony Barr and 17 other players in a June 4 video asking the league to condemn racism, discussed how his initial trepidation about speaking up gave way to a realization he couldn't stay silent. Running back Ameer Abdullah, who'd knelt during the national anthem while with the Lions in 2017, talked about his father's participation in the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march and the Vietnam War and his own experiences in Alabama as a "double minority" growing up black and Muslim.
And Spielman teared up as he shared how one of his adopted sons was once pulled over for driving an expensive car, having to call home so Spielman's wife, Michele, could tell a police officer the driver was her son and the car was hers.
"When I'm able to go out in the community with my wife and we have our kids with us, they see a whole different world," Spielman said. "But when they go out on their own, one of my sons gets pulled over because he's driving my wife's car that's a really nice car. And he gets pulled over because of the color of his skin. To think that black man can't be driving that car, he must've stolen that car. … I struggle to try to explain to our kids why they have to live in two different worlds."
Kendricks said Roger Goodell's June 5 video response -- during which the commissioner said, "Black lives matter," and admitted the league had wrongfully discouraged players from peaceful protest -- was "what we wanted," adding he expects to talk with the commissioner in the next few days.
"We want to try to keep it to football as much as possible, but these are issues that are facing the majority of the players' communities," Kendricks said. "For us to feel like we can't speak up about it, it just didn't feel right."
The linebacker said the NFL's gesture could give more players the freedom to protest during the 2020 season, though he added the Vikings -- who haven't publicly protested since linking arms during the national anthem for much of the 2017 season -- have recently spent more time discussing community efforts than protest plans. Spielman said the 2017 decision reflected the team's belief in doing things together, adding, "I just think it's so important [to realize] the message gets lost sometimes, what the actual problem is."
The general manager demurred when asked about former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's continued unemployment, saying, "Down the road, if there's an appropriate time, we can address things, but I want to keep the football-related stuff out of this, because I don't want the message to get diluted from what we're trying to accomplish today."
Vikings Chief Operating Officer Andrew Miller called Floyd's killing "a tragic and senseless act" that "highlighted a number of facets of our society that are broken, including law enforcement. And that's led to a culture of systemic racism that needs to be fixed."
Players, Miller said, have led efforts to have conversations with Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo; 10 of them, including Kendricks and Barr, met with Arradondo last weekend.
The Vikings, Miller said, are "still talking through" whether to end their relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department.
"We're trying to understand the different perspectives that people have, and trying to make the best decision possible," he said. "There's complexities to any relationship, and ultimately we want to do what's best for our organization and for our fans."

A low-key opening day for MOA: Only about 150 of the mall's 500 stores were available to shoppers on Wednesday.

Full text: Raekwon Martin of Bloomington drove to Mall of America on Wednesday morning to be part of its reopening after 11 weeks of being closed because of COVID-19 and then the unrest after George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody.
"I wanted to catch my shopping before everyone else," he said. "I'm used to coming here every week, but during the last few months, I have grown used to disappointment. It feels good to be here again and beat the wave."
With only about 150 of the mall's 500 stores open on Wednesday, many customers were likely to find favorite stores still closed. Macy's opened last week and Nordstrom opens Thursday, but Nickelodeon Universe, many food-court restaurants, Sea Life and CMX movie theaters remain closed. An increasing number of retailers are expected to open each day.
On a normal day, the mall would expect about 150,000 visitors, but Jill Renslow, senior vice president of business development, expects far fewer than that initially.
"Parking spaces have been reduced by 50%, and that should keep the number of mall visitors at about 35% capacity," she said.
Ramp spaces on levels five through seven have been closed in some wings. The east surface lot on 82nd Street and 24th Avenue is closed. The south-side surface lot and a part of the north-side lot near Ikea is closed.
Face masks are not required to enter the mall, but some retailers in the mall are requiring them before entry.
The most popular destinations were easily discovered. Many shoppers thought the mall opened at 10, but stores did not open until 11. Mall doors open at 8 a.m., and stores close at 7 p.m. daily.
The line at JD Sports stretched to about 50 people as it opened at 11. Andrew Tran of Eagan got in line at 8 a.m. to nab a pair of just-released athletic shoes, the Air Jordan 1 Royal Toe.
"With so many stores closed, I have a good chance of finally getting them," he said. "It helps to be first in line."
JD store employees were distributing slips of paper for customers to write down their shoe size. Only two customers were allowed in the store at a time for safe distancing.
Martin Hallkvist, owner of Scandinavian North, couldn't open his store Wednesday because he couldn't round up enough
employees to work. The mall gave store owners only a few days' notice regarding the reopening.
"All of my five employees are eager to come back, but they needed more than five days' notice," he said. "Our customer demographic is a bit older so I think our traffic will be down 80% initially. I feel blessed for the government assistance to be able to reopen."
MOA neighbor Ikea reopened earlier in the week.
Several shoppers in line to check out said they had tried to "click and collect" their order at Ikea's website, but the time slots were always full. The company has become a target of social media complaints about its slow adoption of e-commerce.
Orders have been canceled, phone lines are busy and home-delivery waits are three to five weeks. With slots opening up for click and collect at midnight, only night owls were able to nab time slots for pickup.
To check to see if a Mall of America retailer is open, go to MallofAmerica.com. The site also lists retailers offering curbside pickup, which has moved to level one east and west parking ramps. About 25 retailers participate.
Malls were able to open in mid-May, but because of its size, MOA was planning to take some extra time to figure out the logistics. The week before the planned opening George Floyd died in Minneapolis police custody, and the ensuing protests and unrest had MOA postponing opening plans again.
The Twin Cities metro's other malls are open as well.

Full text: Donations from outside of Minnesota are flooding Twin Cities nonprofits in a surge of giving after the death of George Floyd and the riots that destroyed parts of Minneapolis and St. Paul.
Organizations that were looted or burned, or that work with racial justice issues, have seen an unusual uptick in out-of-state donations as the Twin Cities remain the epicenter of a global outcry over Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Local foundations and nonprofits also have launched rebuilding funds. On Wednesday, the Pohlad family, the owner of the Twins, announced it was dedicating $25 million to racial justice, partnering with organizations to address inequities.
More than $8 million has streamed in on the fundraising website GiveMN, mostly from out-of-state donors -- more money in the past two weeks than all the money
given during March, April and most of May to help nonprofits during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"It's incredible that the support is coming in and it's going to need to continue," said Jake Blumberg, who heads GiveMN. "It's really heartening … the response has been so significant."
But about 85% of donations on GiveMN's site the past two weeks are from outside of Minnesota -- the opposite of what the site typically sees. The average donation is smaller, about $45, three times less than the average amount on GiveMN's Give to the Max Day, the largest giving day in the state each year.
Like the influx of giving for COVID-19 relief, Blumberg said, the increase in giving to organizations such as the Little Earth Residents Association, which is providing food and resources to the American Indian community, and media organization Unicorn Riot is a "disaster reaction, too."
The Minnesota Freedom Fund, which pays bail bonds, didn't do any organizing campaign, and yet the small Minneapolis nonprofit has drawn $30 million from more than 900,000 donors, mostly outside of Minnesota thanks in part to celebrities such as Justin Timberlake and Steve Carell promoting it. The average donation: just $41.
One of those distant donors is Lea Klein of Los Angeles. Though far from the Minnesota protests, she was moved to help, contributing to the Minnesota Freedom Fund.
"It's the heart of the George Floyd protests," Klein said of Minnesota. "If there's any injustice in the U.S. it affects everyone."
Steve Boland, treasurer for the nonprofit, said "It's stunning to see that kind of thing. Donors … came to us."
At one point, the nonprofit was so overwhelmed by donations that it asked people to send money to other groups. Boland said people across the country have felt compelled to do something to create change in Minneapolis after Floyd's death. Since arrests have subsided, he said the Minnesota Freedom Fund will use donations for a campaign to end cash bail in Minnesota.
In St. Paul, the Hamline Midway Coalition and Union Park District Council also received a burst of donations, with about $500,000 given over two weeks to help damaged businesses.
"There's some hope; people want to build something better," said Brandon Long, executive director of the Union Park District Council. "We're showing the community can lead itself."
Communities of color have been hit especially hard.
Arson destroyed the building housing the American Indian nonprofit Migizi, and it will take several million dollars to rebuild. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations have come in, mostly from outside Minnesota. Kelly Drummer, who leads the nonprofit, credits Indian news coverage and help from the state's 11 Indian communities in spreading the word.
"I didn't expect this at all," Drummer said. "It really puts Migizi and the urban Indian community on the map. Out of this, there is a lot of light."
At the Northside Funders Group, executive director Sarah Clyne hoped to bring in $1 million after West Broadway Avenue businesses were destroyed. Within days, donations poured into the site from all over, pushing their goal to $5 million.
"I don't think anybody expected the incredible amount of support we've received," Clyne said. "I think all eyes are on our city right now."
However, Clyne said, it will take much more than $5 million to rebuild the North Side. North Minneapolis was already dealing with disparities such as higher business vacancy rates. Some businesses were still recovering from the 2011 tornado. Then the pandemic shuttered businesses, and arsonists hit.
North Siders quickly mobilized to create a temporary food shelf and start the rebuilding process.
"This is actually what north Minneapolis does; we're constantly in triage," said Felicia Perry, executive director of the West Broadway Business and Area Coalition, which will disburse the donations. "It's really a show of what grassroots compassion can do."
Dozens of GoFundMe sites have also drawn thousands of dollars for businesses and local efforts, and more than $14 million for Floyd's family.
At the 38th Street and Chicago Avenue intersection that's turned into a massive memorial to Floyd, Valerie Quintana, 51, and Mary Claire Francois, 18, saw some needs that weren't being addressed. So they organized street cleanups, put up port-a-potties and provided hand sanitizer, garbage bags and canopy tents for those handing out water and food thanks to a fundraiser that's topped $12,000.
The St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation has given $100,000 to nonprofits to heal racial trauma. More than 40 foundations -- from Target to the Vikings -- are giving $2 million to organizations helping black and Indigenous communities.
The Greater Twin Cities United Way, Minneapolis Foundation and St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation teamed up with a fund to aid small minority-owned businesses and also started an initiative to reform the criminal justice system.
The Headwaters Foundation for Justice is looking at both short- and long-term needs with a new fund to support both rebuilding businesses and pushing for racial justice.
"People are feeling really inspired," said Maria De La Cruz, the executive director, adding that donations have come from as far away as the United Kingdom. "What's really interesting is how much money is flowing into Minnesota during a pandemic."

Full text: Harry Davis Jr. was on the phone with Printice Gary in Dallas last week. They were discussing the epic response to the death of George Floyd at the knee of a Minneapolis cop on May 25.
Gary and Davis were part of Minneapolis Central's Class of 1964, which included tremendous athletes who became very successful adults. Davis was known as "Butch" to that group and speaks with love and pride of teammates and classmates of 56 years ago.
For instance: Emerson Carr, one of the first two black football players at the Naval Academy, Marine fighter pilot, industry executive. Eric Eversley, Ph.D., Harvard. And Gary, Carleton grad and MBA from Harvard, one-time member of the University of Texas Board of Regents.
"Printice is a smart guy and said to me, 'What has happened since the death of Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis, the reaction around the globe … our grandchildren are going to grow up in a different world than we did, Butch.'
"This time is different for sure. What we've known as black Americans now everyone has seen. Forming committees and words are not enough.
"The eyes of younger generations, black and white, were opened by that video. They realize the same opportunities for black Americans are going to have to come."
This conversation was taking place Tuesday morning at Hiawatha Golf Course, 2 miles southeast of the street where Floyd was killed two weeks earlier. A loose organization of black golfers has gathered for league play at Hiawatha for decades.
There were 20-some players, with tee times starting at 10 a.m. I attended one of these outings in June 2019, to write a column on Bob Shelton, the ageless wonder (now 87) of the group.
No celebration this time; just a search for perspective on where we are, where we could be going, in a city and a state these older black men have made home.
Brett McNeal was the first Minnesota basketball player to be coached by Clem Haskins when he was recruited from Minneapolis North to Western Kentucky in 1985.
McNeal is now the athletic director at Minneapolis Edison.
"We are all human beings," McNeal said. "We all are capable of love and compassion for one another. Wise counsel should be the first response for adults, not punishment. There are certain individuals that don't believe that. Their immediate reaction is to punish."
McNeal paused, took a sweeping lefthanded swing on the driving range and said: "All change comes from power. The alt-conservative groups have been telling us how they came to power. You can get mad about it, but they are correct.
"And those that are strongly committed to change after George Floyd's death … the only answer is to take the power."
Change will come, McNeal said, if not now, eventually.
"The younger generations that I work with are a mixed society," he said. "Absolutely, things will be different when they have power."
As Printice Gary said to Butch Davis: Their grandkids will live in a different world.
Which isn't soon enough as the video of Floyd's killing continues to create outrage around the world.
"I saw video of a man in Syria who had drawn an image honoring George Floyd on a wall," Davis said. "Even in Syria this was deemed terrible."
John Henry, an instructor and inventor in technology and electronics, moved to Minneapolis in the '70s, getting bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Minnesota.
I was talking with Henry before he teed off and suggested the reaction "seemed different" this time because of the clear, gruesome video.
Henry shook his head slightly and said: "The reaction from some is starting to look very familiar to me. We're hearing about George Floyd's fentanyl, this and that about the victim, as though that made him a threat, down on the pavement in handcuffs.
"What concerns me is what I would hope concerns reasonable people: a license to kill with impunity."
John Henderson, the former Vikings receiver, is a regular on Tuesdays. He brought along his grandson Noah Layton, a Benilde-St. Margaret's graduate headed to Columbia University to play football and get an Ivy League education.
"Younger people see race differently," Layton said. "Look at 18-to-25 voting. We believe in equality. Look at the peaceful protests with thousands of blacks and whites marching together. I have confidence in us."
Davis' father, Harry, ran for Minneapolis mayor vs. incumbent Charles Stenvig in 1971 and was decisively defeated. As the first black candidate for the office, there were enough threats that the Davis family home had security from the city leading up to the election.
"As baby boomers, what we went through with the assassinations, and in the '70s, I thought we had seen it all," Harry Jr. said Tuesday. "I thought we might be turning the corner. But the George Floyd tragedy tells me we have a long way to go."

2010 DEATH AN UNLEARNED LESSON?

Author: BJORHUS, JENNIFER; Sawyer, Liz

Full text: In 2013 the city of Minneapolis paid $3 million to the family of David Cornelius Smith, who died after police pinned him face down, while handcuffed, on the floor of a downtown YMCA.
It remains one of the largest payouts for a police misconduct lawsuit in the city's history, and Smith's death in 2010 focused public attention on the dangerous prone restraint tactic.
Now, following the death of George Floyd in a similar restraint, Smith's family wants to know whether the Minneapolis Police Department ever fulfilled a promise in the city's settlement to require all sworn officers undergo training on the dangers of positional asphyxia.
Smith's sister put the question to the civilian Minneapolis Police Conduct Oversight Commission (PCOC) on Tuesday evening. Billed as a community-listening session, the virtual meeting was the panel's first since Floyd's death May 25 and the violent protests that erupted afterward.
Speaking from Atlanta, David Smith's sister Angela choked back tears as she told the commission how devastated her family is that another black man has died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Smith, 41, said that her family fought for a settlement that included MPD reforms on the use of such extreme restraints, so that "nobody else would have to die like my brother did."
"But now I heard George Floyd cry out for his mom, and people stood by as he died," she said. "We want to know: Why didn't the police train officers to let them know how dangerous this type of restraint is, and these people don't have to die?"
Of the nearly 20 people who spoke, some offered concrete recommendations for altering the current state of policing.
The Rev. Daniel Wolpert, a Presbyterian minister who lives just two blocks from where Floyd was killed, blasted the commission for "milquetoast" statements regarding Floyd's death and its inability to create meaningful reforms.
"You are certainly not a credible public body. That's not surprising. Most civilian oversight commissions have no power and no teeth," Wolpert said. "You should try to be honest about the fact that you can't really do anything."
Commissioners thanked the public for their comments and said they were necessary, if difficult to hear.
Chairman Afsheen Foroozan told Smith that he would find out whether the MPD did the agreed-upon training. Commission member Abigail Cerra said that she asked the MPD and was told to submit a data practices act request for it, which she did.
The seven-member commission is a civilian group appointed by the mayor and City Council. It directs and guides the Office of Police Conduct Review, which investigates misconduct complaints. Unlike the commission, the review office is made up of paid city staff and law enforcement officers and is part of the city's Department of Civil Rights.
Jeff Storms, a lawyer who represented the Smith family in its lawsuit, said people have known for decades that holding individuals in a prone restraint position, particularly with weight on their back, can kill them.
"It would be deeply disturbing to believe that any officer in the year 2020 would not train on the risks of positional asphyxiation, particularly in Minneapolis," Storms said.
Storms said the MPD announced in 2012 that it distributed a video for officers on the dangers of prone restraint tactics to play during roll call. The video included a medical examiner advising officers "not to restrain subjects in the prone position with weight on the subject's back," court documents show.
That was before the 2013 settlement with the Smith family, however.
Minneapolis Police spokesman John Elder told the Star Tribune on Tuesday that he did not know whether all officers received the training, and advised the newspaper to submit a data practices act request.
Veteran MPD officers privately said they didn't think it was possible that a seasoned officer such as Derek Chauvin didn't know about the dangers of body weight pins, or positional asphyxia. For decades, the department's annual in-service training regularly mentioned the term, one retired senior official said, and repeatedly taught law enforcement not to leave an individual on their stomach -- especially while handcuffed.
Al Giraud-Isaacson, a former member on the civilian watchdog panel, lamented that nothing has changed since the commission's founding in 2013. It still struggles for funding, begs for City Council members to engage and lacks real authority.
"There's no oversight of police conduct with this commission -- and it's not the commissioners' fault. They do everything they can under their power to influence changes, influence policy," he said, but urged current members to fight for greater authority.
"Demand the City Council rewrite the city ordinance that regulates oversight of the police; take the police completely out of the process," Giraud-Isaacson said. "Lobby the state to change the state statute … that severely restricts what Minneapolis can do on oversight."
Giraud-Isaacson was referring to the changes made in 2012 taking away the ability of civilian oversight bodies to make a finding of fact or determination regarding a misconduct complaint or impose discipline on an officer.
In an interview following the meeting, Commissioner Cerra said she had her marching orders.
"I received the clear directive from residents and the Smith family: Step up and get at it," Cerra said. "The PCOC has power, and I will use it to demand systemic change."

Medical examiner faces challenge by board: Baker, who is up for reappointment, issued autopsy of George Floyd.

Full text: Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker, up for reappointment to his fifth term as the county coroner, faced a challenge Tuesday from a county commissioner unhappy over his recent autopsy of George Floyd.
Commissioner Angela Conley voted against Baker's reappointment because of his findings on Floyd, whose death May 25 at the hands of Minneapolis police has sparked an international outcry for police reform.
Commissioner Irene Fernando also voted against Baker's reappointment because the board was given a short deadline to act. Baker's reappointment would take effect Friday, which Fernando said didn't allow time to evaluate his office's performance and get feedback from residents.
County Administrator David Hough said the vote was delayed for three months due to the pandemic. The board, acting in committee, approved Baker's reappointment on a 5-2 vote and is expected to ratify the committee vote Thursday.
Baker's report ruled Floyd's death a homicide and mentioned police restraint and underlying health conditions as causes. But Conley took exception to the report's mention of "potential intoxicants in his system," which she said criminalized him even in death. Floyd's toxicology report showed that he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system when he died.
"Why would this be listed?" said Conley. "The community lost trust in the system. That report was ultimately the catalyst of an insufficient [third-degree] murder charge by the county and later upgraded to [second-degree] murder by the state."
An independent autopsy by Floyd's family also listed his death as a homicide but said he died as a result of mechanical asphyxiation caused by the police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Conley said that report proved "what millions of people around the world saw with their own eyes."
"Baker's report gave the very reason not to trust these processes that haven't brought justice in the past," she said. "With a good conscience, I can't approve this today."
Baker was first named the county's medical examiner in 2004. A former president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, he has been spearheading plans for a new medical examiner facility in Minnetonka.
Several commissioners agreed with Conley's concerns but said Baker has an excellent reputation. Commissioner Debbie Goettel said the county needs to revisit "how we do business" and how to improve its operations.
Board Chairwoman Marion Greene said one of the few things that County Attorney Mike Freeman and Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarity agree on is Baker's expertise.
Commissioner Jan Callison said she's worked with Baker for 12 years and said his list of credentials is impressive.
"In my experience, I find him professional, honest and trustworthy," she said.

Full text: Federal authorities are asking for help in identifying several suspects who allegedly set fires in Minneapolis during protests over the killing of George Floyd while in police custody.
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) released several pictures Tuesday of suspects captured on security cameras allegedly setting fire to a school, grocery store and the Minneapolis Third Precinct police station, among other buildings.
"Progress has been steady in the Minneapolis fire investigations, and we are at a point where we need help identifying people," said Jeff Reed, assistant special agent in charge of the ATF St. Paul Field Division, in a statement. "These arsons are adversely impacting our communities, business owners, employees and their families."
Also on Tuesday, two more people were charged with conspiracy to commit arson for allegedly starting fires at a St. Paul health and nutrition store on May 28. Samuel Elliott Frey, 19, and Bailey Marie Baldus, 19, allegedly entered the Great Health and Nutrition store at 1360 University Ave. W., along with three other people and used flammable hand sanitizer to start a shelving unit on fire.
At least 570 buildings were vandalized or looted across the Twin Cities as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets several nights in a row to protest the death of George Floyd, who was killed on May 25.
At least 67 buildings were completely destroyed.
Floyd, a 46-year-old black man from St. Louis Park, died after then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds while two of his colleagues held down the rest of Floyd's body. His death set off peaceful protests and vandalism across the country and around the world.
All four officers at the scene -- Chauvin, J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- were promptly fired. All four have been charged in the case.
The ATF released photos of several suspects who allegedly set fire to the Minnesota Transitions Charter School, the Minneapolis police Third Precinct building, an AutoZone store, a Wells Fargo Bank building and an Aldi's grocery store. The agency said it was working with the FBI, Minneapolis police, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and other law enforcement agencies to investigate the fires and other crimes related to the protests.
The agency also put out a plea for cooperation from anyone who "incited or promoted violence of any kind."
Anyone with information about the identities of the people involved can call the ATF at 1-888-ATF-TIPS (1-888-283-8477), e-mail ATFTips@atf.gov, or submit information online at ReportIt.com.
Witnesses who have digital evidence to share or tips can call 1-800-CALLFBI (1-800-225-5324), or visit fbi.gov/violence.

Prayers on plywood: Artists waste no time spreading messages of hope, healing and social change on boarded-up buildings in the Twin Cities.

Full text: Artist Ryan Stopera slapped a stencil outline of George Floyd's face over a plywood board painted deep purple. Sheets of wood covered the street-facing windows of Fallout Urban Arts Center in the Whittier neighborhood, one of countless boarded-up Twin Cities buildings being transformed with paint and passion.
Stopera held the stencil in place while another artist shook a can of gold spray enamel and took aim at the cutup paper.
"Art can be an expression of prayer, a hope for the future, and a way of dealing with systemic racism," said Pastor Peter Wohler, executive director of Source MN, a faith-based organization that sponsors the Fallout and works with at-risk populations.
In the wake of last week's riots, hundreds of artists around the city are transforming boarded-up windows with messages of remembrance, hope, demands for justice, healing community and pride for minority-owned businesses. Some create their own variations of Floyd's familiar portrait. All are infusing powerful, positive energy during a painful time of growth and reconciliation.
"I think a lot of people have found themselves in this space of 'What to do?' and some of us went to art," said Stopera. "Even the act of painting is so meditative -- and this is traumatic."
Using the hashtag #creativesaftercurfew, Stopera, Leslie Barlow and 20 to 30 other predominantly BIPOC (black/indigenous/people of color) artists are part of one crew painting murals on boarded-up businesses.
They received $5,000 from the Graves Foundation, discounts on paint supplies and free brushes from Wet Paint in St. Paul. Blick Art Materials chipped in $2,000 toward future murals. There's no time to apply for grants, so donations are essential.
"There's a momentum right now with everything that happened," said artist Mackenzie Owens, who joined on Day 2 of painting. "We've got to get out."
As of Thursday the crew had done five murals. The boards could stay up for three to four weeks, and the crew has 20 businesses on deck. They focus on BIPOC businesses, with BIPOC artists developing the mural messaging.
At Fallout, Wohler gave the artists free rein to do whatever they wanted on its big boarded-up windows. The pastor sees a double injustice in the wake of Floyd's death: the perpetuation of systemic racism and the destruction of immigrant-run businesses. Murals, he believes, are one way to combat visual signs of violence that the charred storefronts on Lake Street represent.
The artists work quickly. The two-panel mural -- showing Floyd, silhouettes of people with a pair of brown hands holding nutritious food, and a phoenix rising from the ashes -- was painted by 15 community members in about 11 hours.
Last-minute location change
Everything is done on the fly, making plans flexible and often last minute. The artists moved to Fallout after their plan to paint the soon-to-be demolished Kmart on Lake Street fell apart.
Barlow thought of painting large hands holding up phones, symbolizing how people are getting the word out through social media, but on the screens they'd paint images of the future they wanted to see, whether it was "abolish the police" or "housing for all."
Kmart had been working with Wohler on the mural idea -- that morning, volunteers from the Fallout had whitewashed over graffiti there -- but then a store manager came out to talk with the artists.
"I don't want this to be a mural with a political message one way or the other," said the manager, who would only identify himself as Dan. "We don't want to be on either side. We just want to be out of the middle."
"The problem is that people don't want to take a side," said Barlow. "You are a business in a predominantly black and brown neighborhood."
The artists asked if there were any words or images he preferred. Dan suggested words like "peace" or a mural with flowers. The artists packed up their supplies.
When asked why the artists felt it was important for the mural to be here, Barlow pointed to Kmart's location in a heavily Latino and immigrant community, just one block from the Fifth Precinct police station that was under siege just days before.
"It's right here, in the middle of the community."
Mystery muralists
Hisham Hassan, owner of the pizza shop A Slice of New York in the 2400 block of Nicollet Avenue, got a message from a friend that someone had painted a mural on his boarded-up front window: A portrait of a black man wearing a bright orange shirt pops out against a light orange background. He has no facial features. Two fists holding orange-and-white-patterned cloths appear under blue-outlined yellow-and-orange letters with the text "George Floyd!"
"I want to keep this," said Hassan. "It's too big, but I will find a place. It is a part of history."
Hassan has no idea who the artist is, but he welcomes the mural's presence.
"Maybe the sadness, maybe something good will come of it," he said. "Maybe, people will wake up and understand."

Chauvin's bail raised to $1.25M: Prosecutor says severe charges and public outrage make fired officer a flight risk.

Full text: Unconditional bail for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was raised by $250,000 to $1.25 million Monday afternoon in the May 25 killing of George Floyd while in police custody.
Chauvin made his first court appearance by video feed, handcuffed in an orange jumpsuit sitting at a small conference room table in the Hennepin County jail.
In a hearing that lasted just 15 minutes, prosecutor Matthew Frank argued that the severity of the charges and the strength of public opinion against Chauvin made him a more likely flight risk. Frank asked District Judge Jeannice Reding to raise his bail from $750,000 to $1 million with conditions, and from $1 million to $1.25 million without conditions.
The conditions include: that he remain law abiding, that he not have any contact with Floyd's family, that he not work in law enforcement or security, that he surrender any firearms and licenses to carry, that he remain in Minnesota under court supervision, and that he sign a waiver of extradition upon his release.
Neither Chauvin nor his lawyer, Eric Nelson, objected.
Chauvin, 44, of Oakdale, faces charges of second-degree murder without intent, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Chauvin did not enter a plea at the hearing. His next court appearance was set for 1:30 p.m. June 29.
First appearances are typically procedural: The charges can be read to a defendant, although most attorneys waive the reading, bail is argued and another hearing date is set.
Chauvin was charged four days after he killed Floyd, a 46-year-old black man from St. Louis Park, on May 25. He is being held at the state prison at Oak Park Heights.
The courtroom was mostly empty, occupied only by a handful of sheriff's deputies, reporters and lawyers. Plastic covers had been added along the bar separating the audience and lawyers as a precaution against the pandemic. Two large flat-screen televisions were placed in front of the judge's bench to show a live feed of Chauvin, who sat with jail personnel in a separate conference room.
Chauvin waived a reading of the complaint against him.
Frank quickly summarized the charges and what has been seen by millions from around the world in witness videos of the arrest and subsequent death of Floyd.
Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck "while he went limp and eventually lifeless," Frank said. "Obviously, the death of George Floyd has had a strong reaction in the community, to put it mildly."
Chauvin sat with his hands under a table for most of the hearing, at times looking like he was leaning forward to better hear questions from the judge and the video stream.
Nelson, Chauvin's lawyer, quickly ducked out of a side door at the courthouse after the hearing as dozens of reporters from around the country waited outside.
"I'm not making any comments at this time," Nelson said.
Chauvin's former colleagues, J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, are charged as accomplices.
A video recorded by a bystander showed Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck as he told the officers he couldn't breathe and that he was going to die. Lane and Kueng were out of view restraining Floyd's body.
The video also showed bystanders begging the officers to stop, and Thao standing watch nearby dismissing witnesses' concerns.
All four were fired days after Floyd was killed on Memorial Day.
Kueng, Lane and Thao are each charged with one count of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.
The three are being held at the Hennepin County jail on $1 million bail without conditions or $750,000 bail with conditions.
Attorneys for Kueng and Lane told a judge during their clients' first appearances last week that they were rookies with just a few days' experience and looked to Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene, for guidance.
"At all times Mr. Kueng and Mr. Lane turned their attention to that 19-year veteran," Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, said last week. "[Kueng] was trying -- they were trying to communicate that this situation needs to change direction."
Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, argued last week that his client had asked two times if they should roll Floyd onto his side, but Chauvin said no.
"What was [Lane] supposed to do … go up to Mr. Chauvin and grab him and throw him off?" said Gray, who plans to argue at a future hearing that there's not enough evidence to prosecute his client.
Lane and Kueng had responded about 8:08 p.m. to a call that a man used a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods on the corner of Chicago Avenue and E. 38th Street. They found Floyd sitting in a car nearby, handcuffed him and attempted to put him in their squad car. Chauvin and Thao arrived to assist.
While charging documents said Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the squad, Gray said last week that Floyd resisted arrest, "asserted himself" and later "flew out" of the squad through his own actions.
Lane restrained Floyd's legs, Kueng held onto his back and Chauvin knelt on his neck as he lay in the street.
At one point, Kueng took Floyd's pulse and told his former colleagues he couldn't detect one. Chauvin is accused of keeping his knee on Floyd's neck for about two minutes after Kueng's statement.
Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the complaint.
Kueng, Lane and Thao are scheduled to make their next court appearance on June 29.

New flash point: Police reform: Defunding roils national politics

Author: Bierschbach, Briana

Full text: Hours after a majority of Minneapolis City Council members announced plans to dismantle the city's police department, the idea reverberated in campaigns from Minnesota to Washington.
President Donald Trump went on the attack Monday, his campaign calling on Democrats to denounce the "radical" move, which Republicans say will only create more chaos in cities already damaged by riots. "We're already seeing leading Democrats join this movement, and indeed it is consuming the entire Democrat Party, as the most extreme elements have the loudest voices and demand acquiescence," said Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign.
Democratic candidate Joe Biden responded immediately in a campaign statement saying that while there's "urgent need for reform," he does not support defunding the police. "He hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change, and is driven to ensure that justice is done and that we put a stop to this terrible pain," Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.
In a pivotal election year, Democrats in Minnesota also were forced to grapple with how far police reform efforts should go, with some swing-district Democrats weighing the mood of their more moderate constituents against the anger of an activist base mobilizing in response to the police killing of George Floyd.
U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar,
D-Minn., who represents Minneapolis and some surrounding suburbs, told protesters at a rally to defund the police over the weekend that she supports the move from the council. But outside of Minneapolis, Democrats in Minnesota were hesitant to fully embrace the movement on Monday, instead directing attention to a series of police reform proposals they're supporting in the Legislature and in Congress. Neither package includes a push to defund or dismantle police departments.
"There's no doubt that the criminal justice system is failing black communities and communities of color at disproportionate rates," said Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, DFL-Woodbury. She described dismantling the Minneapolis police as a local issue that the Legislature shouldn't dictate. Kent is leading Senate Democrats as they attempt to reclaim a narrow majority from Republicans this fall.
While the Legislature's top Republican, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, has invoked the fears of suburban moms watching the cities in flames, Kent said outrage over Floyd's death extends beyond the cities' limits. "What I am comfortable with is making sure we are fighting for all Minnesotans, and right now what I'm hearing loudly and clearly from suburban moms and others is we need to do a much better job of protecting our black communities and our black neighbors," she said.
But the issue of dismantling the Minneapolis police in some form will be particularly challenging for Democrats in rural districts that lean Republican. Sen. Kent Eken, DFL-Twin Valley, represents a rural district in northwestern Minnesota where he said the police department is respected in the community.
"I've always had concerns about painting things with a broad brush, and I do feel that in greater Minnesota and our rural communities, law enforcement is integrated into our communities and very involved in our communities," Eken said. "I don't want to see a situation where the state takes over implementing statewide approaches that are all based on what's happening in Minneapolis. I've always been an advocate of more local control."
Republicans in the Legislature are calling on Democrats in control of the House to hold hearings on the proposal to dismantle the police during a likely upcoming special session on Friday. And in campaigns, they are using the push in Minneapolis to paint all Democrats, from top to bottom, as "extreme."
"It's rare that a statement by a single City Council can reverberate not just through state politics but through national politics so rapidly," said Steven Schier, a retired Carleton College political science professor. "It's going to be an issue in state politics and you can bet that Republicans are going to be bringing it up time and again."
Facing a crucial election year, with control of the Legislature up for grabs, as well as a U.S. Senate seat and all eight congressional seats, both sides will be navigating a new mood in racial politics and voters' perceptions of policing.
Republican candidate Tyler Kistner, running against DFL U.S. Rep. Angie Craig in a suburban swing district this fall, called on her to denounce the move by the Minneapolis City Council, saying law enforcement "deserves our support, not to become the target of extreme ideas and ridicule."
Craig is serving her first term in Congress and represents a district Republicans have already been targeting. "When it comes to protecting Minnesota's families and neighborhoods -- we very much need our firefighters, police officers and first responders," she said. "We need real reform, but eliminating them is not the answer."
In the state's U.S. Senate race, Republican candidate Jason Lewis said Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith's "silence on the issue can only mean that she stands with Ilhan Omar and the City Council in wanting to abolish the police."
Smith said in a statement Monday that she doesn't support abolishing police departments. "But it is clear that we need to reimagine policing in a way that emphasizes de-escalation and community engagement," she said.
While Republicans clearly see a wedge issue in defending law enforcement, Democrats sense a seismic change in attitude that they say can't be ignored.
Rep. Carlos Mariani, DFL-St. Paul, chairman of a Minnesota House public safety committee, said he's open to discussing the Minneapolis proposal during the upcoming special session as part of a broader conversation about how to reimagine policing, not just in Minneapolis but across the state.
He rejects the idea that this is an "urban-only reality." He notes that the suburbs are growing more racially diverse each year, as are many rural cities where immigrant communities have planted roots and are growing.
"When folks came out to protest in large numbers, they came out from everywhere. You had suburban moms protesting in our cities and they were racially diverse. You saw actions in greater Minnesota towns, you had rallies," he said. "This is Minnesota's issue. This is not just south Minneapolis' issue. This whole divide-and-separate us out is an old tactic that Minnesotans are not going to buy."

New flash point: Police reform: No road map for Mpls. to defund, scrap police

Author: OTAROLA, MIGUEL

https://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/new-flash-point-police-reform/docview/2411204047/se-2?accountid=12598

Full text: Protesters in Minneapolis and across the country have found a new rallying cry: Abolish the police. And they're determined to make the city where George Floyd died a national example of radical change.
They may differ on what it means to dismantle or defund the police. But the idea has gained momentum across the country, with activists asking people to redefine public safety without armed, uniformed officers of the law.
Black Visions Collective and Reclaim the Block, advocacy organizations that have pushed to defund the Minneapolis Police Department in recent years, have now captured the attention of the city's leaders and its residents.
Kandace Montgomery, executive director of Black Visions, said the process to create something in its place begins now.
"So much of our existence has been the lies fed to us that police keep us safe, and no other alternative has really been presented," Montgomery said Monday. "What happens here in Minneapolis is going to shape the rest of the country and, I believe, the world, so we want to get it right."
This week, movement leaders have forced elected officials to take a public stand. On Saturday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was heckled and sent away by protesters after he told them he did not support a full abolishment of the police department.
The next day, in front of a massive crowd at Powderhorn Park, a majority of City Council members stood on a stage and said they would "begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department."
But doing so means more than just creating a "police in T-shirts" model, Montgomery said. It means investing in other facets of society that lead to a safe and healthy population, such as education, housing and health care.
It also means building a different structure to respond to danger that is "culturally appropriate and competent," she said. Instead of officers responding to calls of domestic assault, substance abuse or mental-health issues, they would be handled by professionals in those fields.
And while a majority of council members made a commitment to end the department, Montgomery acknowledged there needs to be education on the history of the police department -- and on the disproportionate violence enacted by police against black people -- to sway those who support it.
"We offer an opportunity for those individual officers as well as the institutions to be in a real process of truth and reconciliation," she said. "It's clear that not everybody is going to come with us."
Black Visions was formed in 2017 in part by people who helped establish the local chapter of Black Lives Matter, Montgomery said. After defining the collective's message, the group held a protest in front of Frey's home in 2018 asking him to divest from the police department.
Their push for police divestment continued and strengthened when they joined forces with Reclaim the Block. Their campaign in part influenced the city to create its Office of Violence Prevention within the city's Health Department, Montgomery said.
After a wave of violent crime in downtown Minneapolis last year, a survey showed a majority of Minneapolis residents supported Police Chief Medaria Arradondo's request for hundreds more cops in the coming years. The City Council voted to increase funding of the Minneapolis Police Department in last year's budget from $184.9 million to $193.3 million.
But Floyd's killing, and the resulting violent clashes between police and protesters around the nation, convinced many city leaders to listen to the defund police movement.
Council members on the stage Sunday said they would now begin to tackle dismantling the police department through budget negotiations.
Those pushing for the end of the police department said they believe it cannot be patched through reforms.
"We have had citizen review boards, body cameras and a black chief," sMiski Noor, an organizer with Black Visions, said at Sunday's rally at Powderhorn Park. "But we are still here, watching black people get murdered and tear gassed in our streets.
Noor continued: "We are here to rebuild our city on a different foundation. A foundation of real safety, protection for black people, for native people, for immigrants, for disabled folks, for queer and trans people."
The previous day, thousands marched in northeast Minneapolis toward Frey's home, demanding the defunding of the Minneapolis Police Department.
Huda Yusuf, who was at the protest with her 12-year-old son, Jamal Farah, said that while she supported defunding the police, she did not know if it was realistic.
"You know when an executive comes into a corporation and then cleans house and then hires people? You need to clean house," she said. "To me, defunding the police really means that the community is looking at other options."
Farah agreed and had his own solutions, including changing officer training and requiring officers to live in the city they serve.
"People say that there's some good cops and some bad cops," he said. "But the good cops are in a bad corporation. They should change the police or just abolish the police, in my opinion."
Another protester, Maisah Outlaw, said the police department is beyond reform, citing how officers voted in Bob Kroll to become president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis.
She said she'd rather see money go toward experts who treat mental health and substance abuse.
"This isn't the first time an institution that is rooted in racism has been abolished. It's not impossible," she said. "We don't need to scare people and beat people into submission."

Full text: Each year, hundreds of complaints of police misconduct -- from citizens and from inside the Minneapolis Police Department itself -- land before a civilian review board tasked with investigating them.
Only a tiny fraction result in the discipline of an officer.
Instead, the civilian review authority and the MPD have increasingly relied on "coaching" officers accused of misconduct, a Star Tribune analysis of data compiled by the city's Office of Police Conduct Review shows. This gentler form of corrective action for low-level violations has a decided benefit for police. Most disciplinary records are public information, but the department does not recognize coaching as a form of discipline; complaints classified this way are, by state law, kept closed and out of view.
It's possible that some of the 16 misconduct complaints against now-fired Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin that were closed with no discipline, for example, were addressed with coaching.
There is no way for the public to know.
The May 25 death of George Floyd under Chauvin's knee spurred international outrage and renewed calls to restructure or abolish the department. Council members and activists calling for the action often cite union protections -- along with the department's unwillingness or inability to discipline its own -- as a barrier to changing its culture and improving relationships with distrustful minority communities.
In Minneapolis, the state's largest police force, only about 3% of misconduct complaints result in discipline. That number strikes civilian watchdogs and academics alike as low for a department of nearly 850 sworn officers. Comparisons are difficult, however, because there is no central repository for tracking police misconduct in the United States, and every agency counts things differently, said Susan Hutson, president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement.
Two departments under federal consent decrees show very different results. In Seattle, roughly 20% of citizen and internal misconduct complaints combined result in discipline. In New Orleans, 14% of outside civilian complaints were sustained with discipline in 2018, while 53% of internal complaints were sustained with discipline.
Around the country, civilian oversight commissions are frequently criticized for lacking the necessary authority to hold officers accountable for their actions. Yet the vast majority lack funding for investigative auditors and don't have subpoena power, she said.
"We are sometimes fighting with one hand tied behind our back," Hutson said. "We need unfettered access to all the data. Period."
Imani Jaafar, a lawyer who directs the Minneapolis Office of Police Conduct Review, defended what she called "a very good layered civilian oversight system." Minnesota law does not permit any civilian oversight group to discipline law enforcement officers, Jaafar said, and that is not the review board's purpose. All it can do is try to help ensure a just process so officers are held responsible within the confines of the law, she said.
When asked if the 3% discipline outcome and use of coaching was acceptable, Jaafar said that was a question for the police department. Only A-level violations -- such as foul language, speeding through a neighborhood or not turning on a body camera at the start of a call -- are eligible for coaching.
Jaafar said her main frustration is the inability to provide information on cases that don't result in discipline, such as coaching cases. Minnesota's public records law does not allow it. That's a "huge problem," she said.
The Minneapolis Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Velma Korbel, who heads the city's Department of Civil Rights, which houses the civilian oversight group, said the low discipline rate and use of coaching are both the result of factors "outside of the Office of Police Conduct Review oversight." She pointed squarely at the discipline matrix Minneapolis police use to sort out infractions.
The state Department of Human Rights investigation of the Minneapolis Police Department underway will look at both, she said. "That is something that absolutely must be looked at in Minneapolis," Korbel said. "I think everything should be on the table. Now is the time."
Michelle Gross, president of Citizens United Against Police Brutality, called the discipline rate "unconscionable." She blames it on the ineffectiveness of the civilian review process, which she said is too dominated by law enforcement and city employees.
Gross estimates the national average for discipline from civilian oversight bodies handling civilian misconduct complaints about 7 to 9%. "It makes us the low end outlier for the entire country," said Gross.
Of the 1,600 police misconduct complaints filed in Minneapolis from 2013 through 2018 -- the last year of completed data -- only 45 resulted in an officer being disciplined. Most of it was a mix of reprimands and suspensions. Five officers were successfully fired during that six-year period, and one was demoted.
During that time more than 270 misconduct allegations were resolved with nondisciplinary coaching.
In Minneapolis, police officers are sometimes not disciplined even when the city pays significant sums to settle allegations that their use of force crossed the line and violated civil rights.
Tou Thao, videotaped watching Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck, was sued in 2017 for allegedly beating Lamar Ferguson while he was handcuffed, breaking his teeth. The city paid $25,000 to settle the lawsuit. Thao was never disciplined for his actions, according to police records.
The low rate of discipline troubles Michael Friedman, executive director of the Minneapolis Legal Rights Center, a nonprofit law firm specializing in criminal defense and restorative justice. He said he doubts outcomes have changed much since he chaired the Civilian Review Authority, the earlier version of the oversight board that collapsed in 2012 amid concerns about effectiveness.
"That concerns me because I don't think that could possibly reflect the rate of the misconduct that's being noted by investigators," said Friedman. "I have no reason to think that the overall pattern has changed."
Two retired senior Minneapolis police officials told the Star Tribune that the department leans heavily on coaching because it offers an immediate corrective action. It's faster and more effective to stick an officer in the hot seat in their supervisor's office, they said, than to deal with paperwork, combative union representatives and hearings -- which often lead to arbitration. A formal internal affairs investigation could take more than a year before discipline happens. By then the officer has moved on.
"It's kinda like if I whacked my dog an hour after he [misbehaved]," said one former senior official, who is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
But others are adamant that coaching shouldn't be used to address deeper problems.
"You can't coach race-based policing," said Merrick J. Bobb, a court-appointed monitor overseeing the federal consent decree that the Seattle police department is operating under.
Bobb and others noted that coaching and its secrecy in Minnesota invite misuse.
"It's not just an administrative workaround; it might also be an intentional way of misleading the public about the true nature and extent of officer misconduct and discipline in the police department," said Metropolitan State University Prof. James Densley.
That's what concerns Friedman. He called Minnesota's public records law "the fundamental issue" complicating efforts to hold Minneapolis police accountable. It says that if an allegation of misconduct does not result in discipline, then all details about who did what are off limits and not open to the public.
"It creates a built-in incentive for police management to let things go so as to avoid public scrutiny for major incidents and preserve their credibility as witnesses," said Friedman.
Bobb was shocked by this provision in state law.
"I find it astounding and disturbing that Minnesota would have a law that prevents citizens from finding out ... what the underlying conduct that was coached was," Merrick said. "One would think that in the wake of the death of George Floyd that coaching and all disciplinary records should be open and transparent to the public."

Torched factory won't be rebuilt in Minneapolis

Full text: A Minneapolis manufacturing company has decided to leave the city, with the company's owner saying he can't trust public officials who allowed his plant to burn during the recent riots. The move will cost the city about 50 jobs.
"They don't care about my business," said Kris Wyrobek, president and owner of 7-Sigma Inc., which has operated since 1987 at 2843 26th Av. in south Minneapolis. "They didn't protect our people. We were all on our own."
Wyrobek said the plant, which usually operates until 11 p.m., shut down about
four hours early on the first night of the riots because he wanted to keep his workers out of harm's way. He said a production supervisor and a maintenance worker who live in the neighborhood became alarmed when fire broke out at the $30 million Midtown Corner affordable-housing apartment complex under construction next door.
"The fire engine was just sitting there," Wyrobek said, "but they wouldn't do anything."
Two days after the riots began, Gov. Tim Walz described the city's response as an "abject failure." Walz ordered the National Guard into Minneapolis to restore order at the request of Mayor Jacob Frey. The violence sometimes overshadowed peaceful protests over the death last month of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.
Frey said Monday that he was unaware of 7-Sigma's decision to move, and he declined to say whether the company's decision reflects the challenges facing city leaders as they try to persuade business owners to rebuild in Minneapolis. Many business owners have criticized the city, saying their pleas for help went unanswered.
Frey said the city was overwhelmed by the riots. He said every fire truck was operating during the protests.
"This was a Guard-sized crisis and demanded a Guard-sized response," Frey said. "And once we had the full presence of the National Guard -- which by the way hasn't been deployed since World War II -- there was a significantly different result."
The city's first survey of property damage shows that nearly 1,000 commercial properties in Minneapolis were damaged during the riots, including 52 businesses that were completely destroyed and 30 other locations that sustained severe damage.
Owners and insurance experts estimate the costs of the damage could exceed $500 million. That would make the Twin Cities riots the second-costliest civil disturbance in U.S. history, trailing only those in Los Angeles in 1992, which were also sparked by racial tensions with police and had $1.4 billion in damage in today's dollars.
To accelerate the recovery, Frey announced Monday the creation of Minneapolis Forward: Community Now Coalition, which includes representatives of local business and community groups. Frey said the group will seek input from black residents and business owners to make sure rebuilding efforts accommodate their needs.
"George Floyd moved to Minneapolis for a fresh start," Frey said. "In honoring his memory and generations of black people who have been victimized before him, we will rebuild as a stronger, more equitable and more inclusive city."
Frey said the coalition will seek financial help from a broad range of private and public partners, but he refused to say how much money the city of Minneapolis is willing to commit to the rebuilding effort, saying that would be "premature." He said the group does not yet have a fundraising goal.
"The city will need to do its part, as well," said Frey, noting that he will request that any new permits or license be "expedited as much as possible."
Wyrobek said it is too late to keep his company in the city. 7-Sigma is a leader in the production of precision rollers used in high-speed printing systems used to produce bank statements and social security checks.
When asked if he thought of relocating before the riots, Wyrobek said, "not in my wildest nightmare." On Monday, he was sorting through the remnants of his business, figuring out how to get up and running again.
"We are cautiously optimistic we can do that," he said. "But we are certainly not able to do that in Minneapolis."

DIVERSITY STEPS UP IN JUSTICE FIGHT

Author: Rao, Maya

Full text: During George Floyd's memorial service, Somali-Americans erected a large portrait of him down the street and offered passersby markers to write messages in his honor. They wore Black Lives Matter shirts and handed out sambusas, or stuffed pastries, to mourners in Elliot Park.
"We're also black, and we go through a lot of the same things that the African-American community goes through: police brutality, just the way people see us," said Fatuma Ahmed, 24, of Minneapolis.
Massive demonstrations following the police killing of Floyd, who was African-American, are unfolding in a far more varied and expansive racial landscape than that of the Minneapolis riots in 1967 during the civil rights movement.
At that time, Minnesota was 98% white, 1% black, and had few foreign-born residents like Ahmed. Now people of color who are not black descendants of slaves are talking about how to show up in the fight for equality, acknowledging in some cases that past battles for civil rights led by African-Americans opened up opportunities for other minority groups.
Among nonwhite people -- who now comprise 16% of all Minnesotans -- African immigrants and refugees have been the most obvious allies in the Black Lives Matter movement. Though their families arrived here from war-ravaged Somalia in the last few decades rather than on slave ships centuries ago, they say white society in the United States essentially views both groups as the same: black.
But other minority groups are stepping up, too. The family of Fong Lee, a Hmong teenager shot dead by Minneapolis police in 2006, is calling on the Southeast Asian community to unite with African-Americans in fighting police brutality.
And Latino immigrants, who lost many businesses on Lake Street to arson and vandalism, are pledging their support to fighting racial injustice alongside black immigrants as they rebuild.
"We're MINORITIES too," reads a sign outside Mercado Central, a Lake Street market of 35 Latino businesses that saw vandalism and looting. "We aren't against you, we are with you."
State Sen. Patricia Torres Ray, DFL-Minneapolis, issued a call for black and brown unity last week, noting that African-Americans led the way during the civil rights movement and Latinos followed. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mexican-American civil rights activist Cesar Chavez had a common goal of unity in the face of oppression, she said.
"As we mourn George Floyd's murder, we must remain united," wrote Torres Ray, who represents the district where Floyd was killed and was the first Latina to serve in the state Senate.
Referring to the city's main Latino and African-American corridors, she added: "As we rebuild our small businesses along Lake Street and in north Minneapolis, we must do so as one."
In 1967, riots protesting racial injustice erupted along Plymouth Avenue on the North Side of Minneapolis. Fires engulfed several blocks; the National Guard was deployed. Uprisings demanding equal rights for black people spread across the U.S. in the late 1960s much as they have now.
The civil rights movement helped pave the way for the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that transformed predominantly white America by opening the border to millions of newcomers from Asia, Latin America and Africa. Much of Minnesota's increased ethnic diversity emerged out of resettlement of refugees from Somalia and Laos.
Outside of East Village Grill in Elliot Park, where Somali-Americans posted a display with Floyd's image, Ahmed said that she grew up in America hearing older Somali relatives speaking negatively of African-Americans.
"We're slowly trying to parse that out and dissect that and say that's not OK," Ahmed said.
She noted that her community also was recently affected by police violence. Isak Aden, a Somali-American man, was shot to death last year by Eagan police during a standoff. Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom said police were justified in using deadly force.
"I think just with the amount of Somali people that have come out with the protests, that just shows that solidarity is there," Ahmed said.
Ahmed's husband, Abdi Sheikh, 23, said Somali-Americans face the same racial disparities in the U.S. as African-Americans. "We might be Somali, but at the end of the day, people see us as black," he said.
He said Somali-Americans owe much to African-Americans for the civil rights movement that opened doors for black newcomers. Sheikh's family came here for salvation, he added, "and there's better opportunities in America due to the African-American community, the civil rights movement and all the rights they've been fighting for. It only makes sense to stand in solidarity."
Abdullahi Farah recently went out to Lake Street with other volunteers to distribute donated food and supplies. Though Farah, executive director of Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center, was born in Somalia, he said that any black person in the U.S. is considered African-American.
"The Somali community, we are hurting, we are in pain," he said of Floyd's death.
State Rep. Jay Xiong, DFL-St. Paul, said in an e-mail that there is anti-blackness in the Asian community that has to be confronted and worked on. And there's complexity as "we find ourselves searching for our souls now," he said, because one of the three officers charged with aiding and abetting Floyd's killing, Tou Thao, is Hmong.
"It is important for our community to stand with black communities -- our values and our missions are bound together," said Xiong. "Hmong-Americans today owe much of their own freedoms to the black people who were enslaved on this continent."
The family of Fong Lee has been urging fellow Hmong citizens to support the black community just as African-Americans supported them when police killed the 19-year-old man. The white officer who shot Lee remained on the job in Minneapolis after a jury ruled he did not use excessive force.
As the Lee family demanded answers, they had supporters from the black, Native American and Latino communities "to help us voice our concerns and our fight for justice for our son's death," said Fong's father, Nou Kai Lee, in remarks interpreted from Hmong by activist Tou Ger Xiong during a Facebook Live discussion Thursday.
"And so this is important because now George Floyd's family is going through the same thing we went through," he said, "and we need to come together to support them to find justice because we are in this together."
"What does George Floyd have to do with Fong Lee?" asked Pakou Hang, chief program officer at VoteRunLead, a nonprofit that trains women to run for political office. "It's the collective anguish and injustice of our people without any type of accountability by police officers."
Hang, who lives a few blocks from the site of Floyd's death, said the toxic nature of police culture is embedded in white supremacy. Until that's untangled, she maintained, police will kill racial minorities without repudiation.
"White culture and white supremacy does not value people of color's lives, and you see that just with the pattern of people being killed over and over," she said.

Arts groups regroup after rioting: Juxtaposition Arts, the Somali Museum and Hmong Cultural Center all suffered damages.

Full text: The art wasn't burned, but several arts organizations, including three run by people of color, are recovering from looting and vandalism following the death of George Floyd in police custody.
The Hmong Cultural Center in St. Paul, Juxtaposition Arts in north Minneapolis and the Somali Museum of Minnesota in Minneapolis are among more than 360 Twin Cities businesses that were ransacked or damaged.
At Juxtaposition Arts, aka JXTA, a community watch guarded its VALT Space and Artist Co-op at 1108 W. Broadway the night of May 28 until 2:30 a.m. After warding off unwelcome visitors, they retired for the night. According to security camera footage, a dozen young people broke into the space about 30 minutes later.
JXTA's chief cultural producer, Roger Cummings, estimates the damage to be less than $10,000, including broken windows and the theft of three desktop and two laptop computers.
"They didn't take any art," he said. "It was probably worth more than those computers."
Three or four looters also tried to damage JXTA's gallery and shop at 2007 Emerson Av. N., but North Side organizer Roxxanne O'Brien stopped them from throwing a brick through
the window, Cummings said.
JXTA, which owns three buildings on the North Side, is using its donation page to replace the stolen goods and to fund community policing from sunset to sunrise through the summer.
At least 17 North Side businesses have been damaged, most of them on W. Broadway. There are already street patrols there, banding together to guard the neighborhood's remaining grocery store, So Low Grocery Outlet.
"We are looking at community policing models," said Cummings. "People stand outside, and when it becomes nighttime, they'll make sure everybody is OK at [JXTA's] skate park, the four corners, back of the buildings."
What struck Cummings was that the youths who looted JXTA could've been employed there. The organization is an incubator for artists aged 12 to 21, building skills that are both empowering and entrepreneurial, and offering the opportunity to work with professional artists. Since its founding, JXTA has helped 3,000 children and young adults through its training programs. Currently it employs 77 young people a year.
"If they register for the summer, they could buy their own computer," he said. "We could provide them with jobs and purpose and place."
The Hmong Cultural Center, at 375 University Av. W., also was damaged on the night of May 28. Vandals broke windows on the side and back of the building.
"We were specifically concerned about the one in the back because people could've come in," said Mark Pfeifer, director of programs. The next morning, the center's staff boarded up the windows and moved key artifacts to staffers' homes.
Pfeifer was unsure about the financial damage, but "it could've been a lot worse." Closed since the coronavirus pandemic started, the Hmong Center had planned to reopen soon, but now things are up in the air.
The Somali Museum of Minnesota, at 1516 E. Lake St., holds more than 700 objects, and is a hub for education on Somali culture. The museum did not respond to a request for comment, but according to its GoFundMe page, some artifacts were lost, and others in the gift shop were damaged. The museum has raised more than $28,000 toward repairs, and has moved most of its objects to secure storage.
"We empathize with the anger and the pain of our community," said a statement on the museum's GoFundMe. "The unjust killings of our black brothers and sisters has to end. We pray that everyone stays safe during this time, we pray that Allah protects the protesters fighting for justice."
St. Paul nonprofit Springboard for the Arts also experienced fire and property damage on May 28. Executive Director Laura Zabel declined to elaborate, saying only that "the Springboard building will be OK," and emphasizing that people are more important than property.
"We want the focus to be on justice for George Floyd and the many organizers who are demanding an end to the white supremacy and racism that is baked into our systems and our city."

Full text: Madeline Clive grabbed a whistle and flashlight as night fell on Minneapolis, stashing her pitchfork nearby, ready for hours of anxiously sitting, watching Lake Street late last week.
After arsonists burned buildings and looters hit stores in the Longfellow neighborhood during protests following the death of George Floyd, she rushed door-to-door plotting nightly patrols. A week later, she was still on alert.
"Let's protect our block," said Clive, a petite 64-year-old who's lived there for three decades. "You're under assault, but you don't know from who."
Bleary residents across Minneapolis -- from Little Earth and Longfellow to the North Side -- had rushed to help neighbors and formed vigilant citizen patrols to protect their homes, businesses and churches at all hours. They barricaded streets with lawn chairs, strollers and cars. They hid garbage bins from arsonists.
A week out from the height of the violence, a fragile calm is descending as neighbors exhausted from overnight vigils reach for a new normal. It doesn't take much for the adrenaline to return. A speeding truck. A car without license plates slowly rolling down the block. Cellphones snap photos and alerts go out.
But neighbors, united over phone apps and group texts in the midst of the crisis, hope to pivot this fresh neighborly energy to push for racial justice and police reform.
"There's an increased feeling of hopefulness that we will get through this, that people will recognize racial injustice," said Gary Berger, as he sat two blocks south of Lake Street in the night's stillness with a neighbor and her dog.
A few nights earlier, Berger had been stationed at the corner of his block with neighbors who erected a makeshift roundabout with traffic cones to slow traffic. They reported at least three cars without license plates to police every night, he said. But now, they're exhausted from sleepless nights and the constant threat of danger.
Nearby in the Powderhorn neighborhood, a group of residents wearing COVID masks gathered under a canopy of trees next to a pop-up herbal clinic and free cups of "Liber-tea."
"How vigilant should we still be?" organizers asked.
After a week of clearing brush and dousing porches with water to guard against arson, they debated how intense their crime watch should be. One resident argued it's time to stop peppering passersby with questions and barricading the street -- it felt unwelcoming.
"The potential for a stronger community and less police force is real," said Morgan Kavanagh, a Powderhorn resident who watched her street from her porch until 4:30 a.m. last week.
Jessica Flannigan and her husband, also of Powderhorn, had been using a baby monitor as a makeshift security camera since the unrest began. Now they're juggling the crime watch with caring for their three children and volunteering to hand out food to those in need.
"No one has had a good night's sleep since this began," she said.
'They're not done with us'
In Longfellow, about 40 neighbors gathered late last week for one of the many crime watch meetings still taking place each night. They ticked off a plan for the evening: Keep outdoor lights on, don't put up wood barriers, wear bright green or yellow. At curfew, they blocked the street with sawhorses.
"We know a lot of people haven't left and we don't know what their intentions are," Clive said as a man pointed out a car without license plates. "We know they're not done with us."
The heightened vigilance has also led to false alarms. When neighbors were told to look for bottles of gasoline reportedly stashed by troublemakers, someone reported a jug outside a restaurant and at the Riverview Theater; both were just cooking oil. A woman rummaging around was homeless, so Clive drove her to a shelter.
"At some point we just have to stop," Anne Thompson, 58, an Australian transplant, said before the block voted Thursday night to end patrols and barricades.
As Clive stood with neighbors in an intersection, a woman reminded them why they're there: a tragedy by another intersection. As the sun set behind pink clouds, they chanted George Floyd's name in unison.
Keeping watch
As armored vehicles rumbled along Lake Street enforcing curfew still in effect last week, a group at Longfellow Market prepared for a long night. The market has been a center of watch groups, guarding the area's last remaining grocery store.
Jay Kloskowski, in a yellow vest and wearing roller blades, clutched a bottle of Gatorade. "You can't outrun me in these," he said of the well-worn blades. "I can get to the corner fast, see the cars before they're gone."
During the height of the violence, the store had up to 20 protectors. Paul Vesey, the market's butcher, said he's relieved the violence has subsided, but still worries.
"I'd like to have a day when I don't have to worry if the store will still be here when I get up in the morning, if the store will be on fire," said Vesey, who works an 11-hour day at the meat counter, goes home for a rest, and then spends several hours on guard.
Some residents fled for cabins or the suburbs during the riots. Melanie Majors, executive director of the Longfellow Community Council, worries some might move altogether.
"I think now we're feeling vulnerable," she said of Longfellow, an enclave of businesses and bungalows, where young families seek starter homes and hipsters seek coffeehouses. "It can all be wiped out in three days. I would not be surprised if in the next year you see people leave."
James Christenson, 51, didn't sleep for three nights as the riots hit businesses near his home. With the smoke still heavy over his house, he drove to his sister's farm. "It was really horrible," he said. "I needed to get away."
Now he's sitting on a folding chair on his lawn in the 3100 block of 30th Avenue S. Next to him, an empty chair and an open invite. His role is to listen, he said. So he welcomes anyone walking by to sit down and chat.
"We're all going to feel some emotion about this, no matter what color our skin is," he said. "Sitting here and talking with all kinds of people has been a way to release that."
Andres Perez was among a group of young Latinos watching an artist put finishing touches on a George Floyd mural near his home in the Erickson neighborhood. "We are so close to where things happened," Perez said. "Even this week, a guy drove by and yelled a racial slur at a black neighbor cutting his lawn."
But Perez said the neighborhood patrols have had a silver lining: He has met more neighbors in one week than he'd met in seven years as a homeowner on the block. So did Mike Lasota, 41, a Powderhorn resident.
"I knew two people [on my block before last week]," he said. "Now I know 20. We don't need the police. I think it's the community keeping us safe."

Full text: Hard days behind us. Harder ahead.
If you made it this far, there's something Autumn Knights, age 11, wants you to hear.
"Just know that you're strong," said Autumn, standing with her family near the place where George Floyd died under a policeman's knee.
Around her, the intersection of Chicago and 38th was full of flowers and murals and donations spread on tables for anyone who comes in need. There's food and music and poetry and prayer. There are children everywhere, watching every move Minnesota makes.
The children know what happened to George Floyd, and to too many black men and women before him.
They've smelled smoke in the night and heard Blackhawk helicopters overhead. They've seen neighborhood shops, libraries, post offices and schools smashed and looted. They know Americans marched in protest and they know police beat and gassed the marchers.
This is what Autumn learned from two weeks of history and heartbreak in her city.
"Things like this happen, but you have to stand up," she said. "Because if you just stay still, you're helping it happen again."
Emma, Maya and Audrey Skibbie live a few blocks from the memorial site. The sisters came by last week with their parents and a protest sign: Black Lives Matter.
"It was not OK, what that police officer did," said Audrey, who turns 9 later this month.
"I think it would be very scary, and it would hurt, to not be able to breathe for eight minutes," added Maya, age 10.
During these long, anxious days, the Skibbie family talked about George Floyd and all the hard questions his death has raised.
"It's important to have honest conversations" with children, said their mother, Vang Skibbie, a child psychologist. "They're part of this community as well, and it's important for them to have the words to describe what's going on."
It's just as important, she said, for parents to help their children feel safe.
"It's important to give extra hugs, reassure our kids," she said. "To let them play a little and still have some time to have fun."
In north Minneapolis, fun was piling up at the beloved neighborhood bakery, the Cookie Cart, which offers job training to hundreds of teens in Minneapolis and St. Paul while offering cookies to everyone else.
Art supplies. Games. Yoga mats. Super soakers. Snacks.
How can we help? Cookie Cart staff asked the teens. What would make you feel better?
"Something fun," the kids told Cookie Cart sales director PJ Stoe. "Something normal."
The donations, the murals the students are painting at the bakery, the yoga classes, they're all meant to help the kids focus on the here and now, Stoe said, rather than dwelling on what just happened or what might happen next.
To help the Cookie Cart, visit cookiecart.org. Their work relies on your cookie orders, and you probably know someone who could use a cookie right now.
Back at the George Floyd memorial, the Knights family is looking with hope to what happens next, starting this weekend.
Isis Knights is graduating from high school. Instead of a party, her family planned to return to the memorial with chocolate-covered strawberries to share.
Her high school, Cristo Rey Jesuit in south Minneapolis, had a few windows smashed in the unrest.
"But it's still standing," said Isis, who enters the University of Minnesota next fall with a double major in prelaw and political science. "Just like us."

CHIEF IS CAUGHT IN HIS FORCE'S RACIAL LEGACY

Full text: As the hearse carrying George Floyd pulled up to North Central University, Minneapolis police Chief Medaria Arradondo tucked his cap into the crook of his arm and dropped to one knee. It was a symbolic gesture of solidarity with a growing movement against police brutality, popularized by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
Arradondo has been a visible and vocal presence in the tumult that has engulfed the city and nation since Floyd, a black man, died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day. He condemned and fired the four officers involved. He visited the location where Floyd was killed. He spoke directly to Floyd's family members on national television. He pledged to cooperate with the state's probe into his department's practices and make "substantive policy changes."
In an interview, Arradondo called Floyd's death "absolutely pivotal" in the city's history.
"This moment in time is writing its own chapter in the history of our city," he said. "The best that I can hope for is that everything that has occurred to this point, all of the work that all of us were trying to do to move forward, it's not done in vain."
But the city's first black police chief now finds himself in a harsh national spotlight, the face of a mostly white department that killed another black man. Last week, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights launched an investigation, and some elected officials are pushing to disband the police department altogether.
Arradondo's defenders credit his willingness to speak out about the pains of racial trauma and the need for police
reform. They say it's unrealistic to think that he would be able to overturn more than a century of institutionalized racism in just three years on the job.
His chief of staff, Art Knight, agrees that "something has to be done on holding our cops accountable," but he questioned the timing of the state's human rights probe.
"When the investigation looks at policy and procedures, we're 100% completely with them, and maybe they do find something that's of concern and needs fixing and we'll work with them to fix it," Knight said. "When we had white chiefs in office nothing was done, but now that we have the first African-American chief and now you want to sue the department?"
So far Arradondo has drawn praise for quickly firing the officers involved in Floyd's death. In past scandals, from undercover marijuana stings that critics say unfairly targeted blacks to allegations that his officers were urging paramedics to sedate agitated people, he also acted fast.
But Floyd's death has City Council members, the MPD and community members grappling over the future of policing in the city.
"We know that a lot of times when you are placed in a role when you've got to make systemic change and you've got to change the police culture, that does not happen overnight," said Ramsey County sheriff's commander Suwana Kirkland, head of the state's chapter of the National Black Police Association. Right now, the death of Mr. George Floyd has been devastating to the profession, the community, to his family, to his friends."
Violent crime has been on the rise since the protests following Floyd's death, and officers say morale is falling after the torching of the Third Precinct station. Adding to the pressure, a high-ranking police official sent out a departmentwide e-mail suggesting that some officers walked off the job or retired abruptly in protest.
Besides that, Arradondo has faced criticism about the department's lack of women and people of color and being too slow to discipline officers accused of on-the-job misconduct. In addition, police use-of-force rates -- which are greatly affected by call volumes -- have risen over the past three years after a long decline, with blacks bearing the brunt in nearly two-thirds of such cases.
Andrea Brown, a public defender who once chaired the Police Conduct Oversight Commission, a department watchdog, said that union boss Lt. Bob Kroll's defense of the officers involved in the death of Floyd and his public alignment with President Donald Trump damages trust in the MPD.
"I think it completely destroys any reconciliation that could happen," she said. "The union is real. ... Cops who don't actually uphold the service and protect for all, they feel like they have its backing."
Arradondo has been seen as the MPD's silver lining by the black community. The 53-year-old Minneapolis native joined the force in 1989, starting as a patrol officer in the precinct covering north Minneapolis. He's remained visible as chief, attending barbecues and basketball games citywide and visiting barbershops. He also talks with unusual bluntness about the historical mistreatment of minorities by police, and in 2007 was one of the lead plaintiffs in a discrimination lawsuit against the department.
But critics say the use of tear gas and rubber bullets on those protesting Floyd's death is a sign of how little the department's culture has changed.
They also wonder why Derek Chauvin, the subject of at least 17 civilian complaints and who had been involved with several police shootings, was still working on the same shift. Some claims that the department's early intervention system -- designed to identify potentially troubled officers and get them help -- has failed.
And having a black chief didn't stop officers from using deadly force, said Sam Sanchez, an organizer with the activist group Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar.
"People are talking about rebuilding, but you can't rebuild something that never worked for the people in the first place," said Sanchez, pointing out that Arradondo is a product of the same system that he says he wants to reform. He said any proposed reforms in the months ahead should include community input.
Arradondo is also being asked to answer for the strained race relations of past years, says retired Hennepin County Judge Pamela Alexander. While more reform is needed, she says that the department has improved in many ways.
"There are ways to substantially improve the system without totally breaking it down, but it does need to have a broader, more expansive view," she said. "It's going to take time and that's unfortunate, but maybe this crisis will then show [rank-and-file officers] why it's necessary to have allies in the community and to improve those relationships."
But there needs to be an honest assessment of how the police can contribute to or harm community health and public safety, said Tabitha Montgomery, executive director of the Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association. Not all incidents in south Minneapolis need police intervention, and there should be discussions about finding solutions for other inequities in the area, she said.
"Just the reliance on police is not getting us better outcomes, it's not driving fewer disparities when it comes to what we are expected to endure in south Minneapolis," she said. "I have no evidence to suggest there is a further erosion [of trust in police] whether it be black people in the community or other people from other ethnicities and racial groups, but what I do know for sure is ... a life that should've been deemed equal to any other was demonstrably illustrated to be less than."
With the Floyd investigation, people are "looking for a fall guy" with Arradondo, and seek to weaken his power, says Resmaa Menakem, a clinical social worker who has led cultural awareness training sessions with the MPD. He said Arradondo understands better than most of his predecessors that nothing will change until something is done about systemic racism that criminalizes people of color.
"The system is sick, the structure is sick, America is sick -- and it stands to reason that if America is sick, the spear and weapon it uses, which is the police department, is also going to be sick," said Menakem. "It's not addressing the bad apple cop -- it's addressing the structure that alienates and brutalizes black and brown bodies, and poor white bodies."
Even after Floyd's death all is not lost, said Korey "XROSS" Dean Sr., founder and executive director of the Man Up Club, an organization focused on mentoring black males, teaching them about conflict resolution, interactions with the police and civic responsibility.
He still believes in Arradondo, calling him "a good man." Dean said one of the ways to overhaul the department is to build up its diversity, including encouraging black men like Arradondo to sign up for the police academy.
"I'm optimistic about the future of the relationship between the police and that's only because of the leadership that I know [Arradondo] has, but at the same time I will say that young black males are still in fear of the police," Dean said. "That is the current relationship that exists between young black males in the inner city and the police department, and there is no relationship there."

Full text: Protesters peacefully took to the streets in Minneapolis on Saturday in a plea to defund the Minneapolis Police Department -- a demand that Mayor Jacob Frey told them he could not support.
There was no official estimate of the crowd's size, but organizers say several thousand attended the march.
The protest was one of many nationwide over the death of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd's death has sparked a national conversation about defunding or downsizing police departments.
Organized by the Minneapolis advocacy group Black Visions, the event began at Bottineau Field Park, passed by the Minneapolis Police Federation's union headquarters, and ended outside Frey's home.
While several members of the Minneapolis City Council support disbanding the department in favor of a model calling for community-led safety, Frey has said he favors reforms instead.
As protesters stopped near his home, Frey emerged and said, "I have been coming to grips with my own responsibility, my own failure in this." When protesters asked whether he will defund the department, Frey said, "I do not support the full abolition of the Police Department." He was then told to leave the gathering, and did.
The march featured poetry readings, indigenous prayers, dancing, placards of all sorts and chants of "George Floyd!" and "Black Lives Matter!"
When the throng pulled up outside police union headquarters on University Avenue, which is surrounded by chain-link fence, they shouted, "You are about to lose your job!" A banner that stated "Closed for Business" was draped from the building.
The police presence at the march appeared to be limited to a few officers on bicycles who kept their distance. March organizers, wearing bright orange and yellow vests, some on bicycles, redirected traffic away from the marchers' path.
Participants pushed strollers, hoisted toddlers on their shoulders and walked dogs.
Addressing the crowd, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said the time for departmental reform has passed. "The Minneapolis Police Department is rotten to the root and so when we dismantle it, we get rid of that cancer and we allow for something beautiful to rise."
Natasha Byers of Bloomington said she attended the march and supports the cause because "police are destroying black folks, they're killing us for no reason."
Others said they hope change will occur. "I want to be able to walk outside my home and not be afraid that I'm going to be attacked" by police or die, said Jaaz Cousin of Minneapolis. "It's our generation; this is the world we live in."
The City Council voted Friday to ban police officers from using chokeholds and neck restraints and strengthened rules for officers to intervene if a colleague is using excessive force. The action needs a judge's approval.

Full text: Volunteers from urban-outreach group Source painted over graffiti on plywood last week at Kmart on Lake Street in Minneapolis. A planned mural could soon encase the Kmart until the building is torn down.
The building now is being cleaned out, marking an unceremonious end to one of the most profitable Kmarts in the country. The liquidation sale stopped soon after it started with discounts ranging from 25 to 75% off merchandise as it wound down to the planned June 30 closure.
Instead, the looting and violence that followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police accelerated the closing.
As Kmart ends its run across the country, the Lake Street location was the one still operating in Minnesota after nearly 50 existed in the state in the 1990s. The Kmart stubbornly stayed put despite multiple attempts by Minneapolis officials to displace it. Early last week as city employees surveyed the damage, Kmart employees swept up broken glass and debris in the entryway and mopped up pools of water on the store floor.
"Kmart provided needed low-cost goods and services within walking distance for many residents and those along the transit corridor," said Steve Poor, director of developmental services for Minneapolis' Community Planning & Economic Development (CPED) office. "The building appears to have no structural damage but since the sprinkler system went off, we have to get rid of the water to avoid mold. We're considering temporary uses of the space."
Rebecca Parrell, CPED's project supervisor, said there is no timeline for the building to be razed after last week's destruction. "Back in March the City Council said demo would begin at the end of 2020 but that was before this happened. Now it's in a period of assessment."
Todd Finney of Medford stopped by on Tuesday to help paint over graffiti on the walls. He grew up in the neighborhood populated by Latinos, blacks and African immigrants.
"It was both a pleasure and a pain for the neighborhood," he said. "A lot of people dont realize it, but it was the main bloodline in the neighborhood. There was lots of foot traffic."
Parrell said the lack of cars in Kmart's parking lot was deceiving. "People felt as if it was never busy because there weren't a lot of cars in the lot, but that was because so many people walked or took public transit."
Renee Cottier, who checked last week to see if Kmart was still open, lives two blocks away and shopped there for 25 years.
"It's an unbelievable loss to the neighborhood," she said. "First we lost Supervalu, and then Kmart became the only place you could buy clothes, shoes, food, and gifts in one spot. With Kmart, Cub and Target closed in the area, I'll have to find someone to take me to the suburbs."
The need for Kmart contrasted with constant calls for a face-lift or complaints that it was a roadblock that cut Nicollet Avenue in two at a critical juncture.
In the early 1970s, the city had big plans for the Nicollet-Lake district that would remake it into a mini Southdale with apartments, offices, a movie theater and restaurants. Land was cleared by 1974 but financing dried up.
With its back against the wall to prevent taxpayers from footing the nearly $2 million bill for bonds coming due, the city hastily accepted an offer from Kmart that included the Nicollet closure.
That decision has been the core of countless attempts to move the store and reopen the thoroughfare since Kmart opened its doors in March 1978 -- all deflected by Kmart or its subsequent owners.
Residents dubbed its stark north exterior the "Berlin Wall" or "Nicollet Wall" and requested a second entrance there. Kmart officials rejected the request, but paid $3,500 to commission a mural on the wall with a design chosen by a committee of five neighborhood groups and painted by six local artists. Parts of the mural remain on the back wall.
Fewer than 35 Kmarts remain in the U.S. as its blue light dims. The St. Paul, International Falls and Rochester stores closed last year. But at its peak, the S.S. Kresge chain operated more than 2,100 stores.
By the 1990s, competitors Walmart and Target began to seal its fate. In 2002, the company declared bankruptcy. Many saw its merging with Sears in 2004 as hastening its demise.
Minneapolis began serious attempts to take back the space when in 2017 it paid $8 million for the 7 acres beneath the store site, becoming Kmart's landlord for a mere $10,000 a month.
Earlier this year, the city bought out Kmart's lease for $9.1 million, nullifying a contract that extended to 2053.
What began by a city willing to ignore the wishes of a neighborhood for a cash infusion is now ending for a retailer desperate for cash.
The city is still assessing its options for redeveloping the site.
"This is a loss of services to the community, but with community engagement and a new street, we are considering those needed goods and services for the neighborhood in the new development," said project manager Parrell.

Key philanthropic forces join up to rebuild, reform

Full text: Three of the largest philanthropic funders in the Twin Cities are dedicating new resources to rebuilding small, minority-owned businesses damaged in last week's riots and reforming the criminal justice system.
The Greater Twin Cities United Way, Minneapolis Foundation and St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation announced Friday they've teamed up, launching a new fund that's reached $1.3 million so far to help pay for repairs, relocation expenses and other aid to those small businesses starting this month.
The three organizations are also beginning a new initiative to reform the criminal justice system through convening meetings, starting educational efforts and examining policies or testifying at the Legislature. While the initiative, led by community activist Huda Ahmed, was in the works for about a year, it was announced Friday -- nearly two weeks after 46-year-old George Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.
"We are looking for lasting systematic change," said Acooa Ellis, senior vice president of community impact at United Way. "George Floyd's death was an example of what's happening too often."
The multiyear initiative will be led by people of color affected by racial disparities, helping define the problem and coming up with solutions.
"The community is ahead of us," said Pahoua Yang Hoffman, senior vice president of community impact at the St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation.
The three organizations were also responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chanda Smith Baker, the Minneapolis Foundation's senior vice president of impact, said the collaboration will now be able to address immediate and long-term needs, putting the time and leadership where their money is -- especially after Floyd's death, which has sparked protests around the world.
"It has activated us to a new level," she said. "That should not be nothing."
Ahmed added: "We're not just going to give grants and expect the community to make things happen."
To donate to the organizations' "Twin Cities Rebuild for the Future Fund," go to tcrebuild.org or text TCREBUILD to 51555.
Other organizations are also stepping up to help businesses that were burned down and looted in Minneapolis, many of which were owned by people of color.
The Lake Street Council has raised more than $4.7 million in its fund while the Longfellow Community Council has raised nearly $30,000 to support food assistance, boost security measures and rebuild businesses.
The Northside Funders Group has also raised more than $1.4 million to help damaged north Minneapolis businesses. And this week, Minneapolis-based Target pledged $10 million to social justice organizations such as the National Urban League and community rebuilding efforts.

Damond reliving the pain after Floyd death: Fianc of police-shooting victim feels solidarity.

Full text: Don Damond sat under a hulking white maple tree in his backyard, 4 miles from where less than two weeks ago a Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on George Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.
A cardinal trilled cheerfully. Dusk began to fall, and the mosquitoes descended in force.
The days since Floyd's death have been disorienting for Damond. In one way, he feels a sort of spiritual connection to the Floyd family.
It was less than three years ago that Damond's fiance, Justine Ruszczyk Damond, was shot and killed by a Minneapolis police officer in southwest Minneapolis.
The past couple weeks have made his fiance's killing fresh again: "I just find myself crying, and I haven't cried in a while."
Damond knows that Floyd's family's pain will not subside in the coming months as the judicial process runs its course.
The situation will only get worse. That's what Valerie Castile -- the mother of Philando Castile, shot and killed by a Twin Cities police officer in 2016 -- told Damond after his fiance's death.
Damond plans to reach out to the Floyd family and offer his sympathies as well as his empathy of having experienced a loved one killed by a Minneapolis cop.
It's a club no one should have to be a member of.
He gets how the two deaths are different. Ruszczyk Damond was a white woman; Floyd was a black man. Mohamed Noor, believed to be the only officer in Minnesota history convicted of murder for an on-duty killing, was a black Somali-American.
Derek Chauvin, the fired officer charged with murder in Floyd's death, is white.
One was a freak occurrence; the other symbolized centuries of American racial history.
Damond's fiance's death was an in-the-moment reflex by Noor: If only the police officer had taken a breath before firing his gun, Damond thinks.
Floyd's death appeared to be about Chauvin exerting control and domination: He didn't want to let Floyd breathe, Damond thinks.
When Damond watched the video of Floyd's death, he focused on Chauvin's face.
"I just watched him," Damond said. "What's going on in his face? Is it fear? No. There's no fear. It's like a sociopathic killer. There's no remorse, no guilt, no anger. There's nothing.
"It's like he could be sitting there drinking a beer with his buddies. The look on his face was, 'I'm just going to snuff this guy and not even bat an eye.' "
There are two things at the heart of the nationwide protests after Floyd's death.
One is about police departments becoming too militarized, too "us-versus-them." That, and they often have bad hiring policies, shoddy policing and poor training.
"To me we're so united in solidarity around excessive use of force, and the reckless and inappropriate use of force, that left us losing a loved one needlessly and tragically," Damond said.
In that way, George Floyd and Justine Ruszczyk Damond are intertwined symbols of a police culture that's lost its way, and of police officers who aren't given the emotional tools to deal with a difficult job.
This part of the story is about how police departments must focus more on training, on changing use-of-force guidelines, on officers treating citizens with more humanity.
But the other thing driving nationwide protests -- the reality of life as an African-American in 21st-century America -- is something Damond understands he will never know.
In another way, though, Damond feels Justine has been invisible during local and national protests after Floyd's death.
Last Sunday morning, six days after Floyd's death, Damond visited the memorial outside Cup Foods. Nobody noticed him.
He was in awe of the sheer number of flowers. He looked at the mural of George Floyd on the wall, and he was overcome by loneliness.
"SAY OUR NAMES," the mural reads, above a portrait of Floyd. There was Castile's name. There were also the names of Jamar Clark, killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2015, and Eric Garner, killed by a New York police officer in 2014, and Tamir Rice, killed by a Cleveland police officer in 2014, and more.
His fiance's name was not on the mural.
"I've suffered the same loss -- the same loss, at the hands of the same police department -- tragic, reckless use of force," Damond said. "I get it. It is so complicated, and I get it.
Damond fears what is to come for the Floyd family. He knows the police officers' defense attorneys will "try and tear down the victim" to sow seeds of doubt.
"They've already started," Damond said: Reports that Floyd had COVID-19, that he had recently taken fentanyl and meth, that he had a violent felony conviction 13 years ago.
He thought of what Valerie Castile told him after his fiance's death: "It's going to be a long haul, honey."
On Friday morning, while Damond was at work, his mother went to the memorial set up at the scene of Floyd's death. She spoke with protesters who were painting on the street the names of people killed by police officers.
The man running the project promised to paint Justine's name on the street, too.

Twin protests press messages

Full text: More than 1,000 protesters crowded downtown St. Paul on Friday afternoon below the offices of Attorney General Keith Ellison to hear speakers call for a review of recent police shootings and community control of police, in the wake of the police-involved death of George Floyd.
"Change is coming!" shouted Marques Armstrong of the Racial Justice Network. "I feel it in my spirit. I feel it in my bones."
The crowd heard from several people who had lost loved ones in police shootings, including the grandfather of Brian Quinones-Rosario, who was killed in September by officers from the Richfield and Edina police departments. Authorities said he had threatened the officers with a knife, but relatives said police didn't need to kill him to arrest him.
Don Williams, Quinones-Rosario's grandfather, told the crowd that "it is not the time to get complacent."
Ellison on Wednesday upgraded charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while arresting him. Ellison also charged three other officers at the scene with aiding and abetting murder.
Those moves followed more than a week of protests, sometimes violent, calling for tougher action against the former police officers.
D'Andre Tolson of St. Paul said he joined the protest because he "wanted to help out and do what I can and share my voice in the protest and be another body in the crowd."
Rachel Carpentier, also of St. Paul, said she came to listen. "For me, being a white person, I know that the black community cannot do it alone," she said. "We need the white people out here to stand up with them."
Maurice Perkins, a U.S. Army veteran and Iraqi war veteran, went to the rally at U.S. Bank Stadium Friday afternoon because "it's about George Floyd, but it's also about the fight to end systematic injustice in the country."
Perkins said he grew up in the same Houston neighborhood as Floyd and graduated from the same high school, and moved to Minnesota last year. "To see all of these people united together for the same cause, for me, I take it personally. I feel like they're speaking up for me," he said.
The U.S. Bank Stadium rally drew hundreds of peaceful protesters who expressed outrage over Floyd's death.
Hip-hop music blared over portable loud speakers as the crowd milled, with organizers handing out water and snacks and leading the now-familiar call-and-response, "Say his name! George Floyd!"
College students Teshawn Kelly and Chris Similhomme were part of the crowd of mostly teens and young adults outside the stadium. Kelly said staying home this week was not an option. Both men expressed frustration at "opportunists" who used protest as a cover to loot and burn.
"I don't want to see the change, I want to be part of the change happening," said Kelly, 22, who attends Minnesota State University, Mankato.
Similhomme, also 22 and a student at MSU Mankato, said he was heartbroken by Floyd's killing. The criminal charges filed against the four officers involved was "step one, honestly. The whole system needs to change," he said.
Margaret Engel, 18, of Minneapolis, was attending her seventh protest. She and two friends have been attending events all over the Twin Cities, and said that the speakers have made them excited about the Black Lives Matter movement. "We have a voice that we need to use, especially with our white privilege," she said.
Nicole Strom said the video of Floyd's death provided strong motivation to protest. "It was absolutely disgusting. No human being should be treated that way, especially based on their skin color," said Strom, 18, of Minneapolis.
Anika Bowie, vice president of the Twin Cities chapter of the NAACP, addressed the crowd and demanded the resignation of Bob Kroll, head of the Minneapolis police union whom many accuse of setting a belligerent tone for the rank and file.
Tamara McLemore, 22, of Eagan, came to the Minneapolis protest with a group of friends to "fight for justice." She said the widespread protests have forced public officials to act. "Protesting made them charge the officers," she said.
McLemore added that Floyd's death was shocking. "I cried and I was disgusted," she said. "Why do they keep killing black people? It's so easy for them."
Eventually protesters began marching from downtown Minneapolis to Cup Foods, the site of Floyd's death. As they chanted and waved signs, neighbors waved and cheered in support.

U.S. Bank pledges active role in recovery: The company will boost loans to black-owned businesses by at least $100 million.

Full text: U.S. Bank will increase new lending to black-owned businesses and rebuild three Minneapolis branches damaged in riots last week, its parent U.S. Bancorp said Friday as it announced other steps to combat racial inequality.
The Minneapolis-based company, which is the nation's fifth-largest bank, said it will boost its support for small and minority-owned businesses that create jobs and build social infrastructure, including $100 million annually in higher lending to black-owned and -led businesses.
The company's foundation also put aside $15 million to award grants to groups that are addressing systemic economic and racial inequities.
U.S. Bank also said it was looking at its own record of hiring and promoting people, saying it would change its "talent management strategy to develop and promote people of color to leadership roles."
Three of its branches, two along Lake Street and another in north Minneapolis, were closed after being damaged or looted in the violence that erupted from protests about George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
"We will not turn our backs or abandon the neighborhoods where so many are hurting right now," Andy Cecere, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.
The company, which has branches in 25 states, experienced damage at a handful of other branches as protests against police violence stretched across the nation in the past week. Those locations were able to quickly reopen.
On the day after Floyd's death and before the protests grew huge, Cecere wrote to U.S. Bank employees that he expected to be held personally accountable for U.S. Bank's "core value of drawing strength from diversity."
"We talk about the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion as a society, but it is hard to say progress
is being made when these are the headlines dominating the news," Cecere wrote in the note last week. "We have to do better, and I believe we can start right here at the bank."
With Friday's announcement, he tied the new efforts to the injustice of Floyd's death.
"George Floyd's life had meaning and purpose. We need to do what we can to give the heartbreak that has followed meaning and purpose, as well," Cecere said.
Throughout the country, every U.S. Bank staffer will be given a new paid day off to do volunteer work in their communities.
On Wednesday, Greg Cunningham, the company's chief diversity officer, noted in an essay two ways that large companies can confront racism against black people: by doing more to hire and promote black employees and working more closely with black-owned businesses.
"So many organizations hire for diversity but manage to assimilation, and that is a fundamental problem," Cunningham wrote. "We need to be more intentional about creating conditions in which all of our employees can develop leadership, demonstrate creativity and advance professionally."
He also said leaders at all levels of a company "need to be active in denouncing systemic racism and acknowledging privilege."
Cunningham ended the essay, written as a letter to employees, by noting that he is frequently asked: "What can our company do?"
"To my 70,000 colleagues, you ARE the company," he wrote. "Be the change you want to see."

Full text: Minneapolis mega-retailer Target has pledged $10 million to social justice organizations such as the National Urban League and the African American Leadership Forum, as well as community rebuilding efforts, after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
Across the country, cities including Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen both peaceful protests and looting and violence in response to Floyd's death, as well as calls for reform from around the world.
"Target stands with black families, communities and team members," said Target CEO Brian Cornell in a Friday statement. "As we face an inflection point in Minneapolis and across the country, we're listening to our team, guests and communities, committed to using our size, scale and resources
to help heal and create lasting change."
In addition to the monetary donations, which will come from both the retailer and its foundation, Target has committed to provide 10,000 hours of pro bono consulting services for businesses owned by people of color within the Twin Cities as they rebuild after recent riots left some damaged.
By mid-June, nonprofits that support businesses owned by black and other entrepreneurs of color also will be able to apply for grants from the Target Foundation to help rebuild business storefronts that were damaged in the riots.
The company's loyalty program Target Circle will offer customers the option to direct Target funds to local nonprofits and organizations supporting social justice.
And Target has created an internal task force of senior company leaders to help analyze the company's "path forward."
"At this critical moment in our Twin Cities communities and across the country, we appreciate the solidarity Target has shown to help rebuild as well as be part of the necessary systems changes ahead of us," said Marcus Owens, executive director of the African American Leadership Forum in the Twin Cities.
Target employees have volunteered hundreds of hours toward cleanup efforts in heavily affected neighborhoods of the Twin Cities, and Target has partnered with local nonprofits such as Second Harvest Heartland to provide truckloads of donated essentials like baby formula, medicine and more in recent weeks.
Target -- which has had a handful of its local stores damaged or looted in recent days -- has reopened most of its stores in the Twin Cities area, including the St. Paul Midway store.
Its Lake Street store in Minneapolis, which was one of the first to be looted and damaged, is anticipated to reopen before the end of the year.
Before the George Floyd protests, Target and the Target Foundation announced $10 million in donations to support organizations helping with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Plan would extend AG's powers to police cases

Full text: Minnesota's county prosecutors on Thursday voted to recommend giving the Attorney General's Office authority to take on all cases of police-involved killings in a move that would need signoff from state lawmakers during this month's special session.
The Minnesota County Attorneys Association (MCAA) will also call on the Legislature for extra funding for the Attorney General's Office and the creation of an independent unit at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to investigate police killings of civilians.
"Our entire association extends our heartfelt sympathy to George Floyd's family and to the collective community that mourns his loss and advocates for honest dialogue and real and immediate change in his name," said Aaron Jordan, Stevens County Attorney and MCAA president.
The group of county attorneys reached its conclusion after an emergency meeting organized Thursday that included Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is now leading the state's case against
the four former Minneapolis police officers involved in George Floyd's May 25 death. Lawmakers would need to pass legislation during this month's special session to give the Attorney General's Office the ongoing authority.
"If this is the path the Legislature and governor choose to take, my office will accept the responsibility," Ellison said. "But it must come with resources sufficient to do the job thoroughly and to do justice in the way Minnesotans have a right to expect."
Ellison is one of 18 Democratic attorneys general who on Thursday signed a letter asking Congress to grant their offices "clear statutory authority under federal law to investigate and resolve patterns or practices ... of unconstitutional policing by local police departments" in their respective states.
Ellison became the first state attorney general to prosecute Minnesota law enforcement officers who have allegedly killed civilians. Gov. Tim Walz asked Ellison to take over the case Sunday from Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who first charged fired officer Derek Chauvin with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter after a video showed him kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes as he begged for air and eventually became unresponsive.
Two days after Ellison formally took over the case, Chauvin's charges were increased to second-degree unintentional murder, and the three other officers at the scene -- Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- were arrested and charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
For Ellison to take the case, state law required that Walz ask him to do so and that Freeman consent. Under the proposed legislation, Ellison's office would have sole authority to prosecute alleged police killings. The office also could request help from a county attorney's office that is not located where the death occurred.
That change -- plus the additional independent BCA unit -- are among a sweeping package of police reform proposals that DFL lawmakers unveiled this week ahead of a special session expected this month. Many of the requests mirror recommendations put forward by a task force assembled by Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington aimed at curbing deadly police encounters.
This week, Walz and DFL leaders said they envisioned the topic to be a "centerpiece" of the special session, and some lawmakers have threatened to hold up the passing of a bonding bill if the proposals go unheard.
Freeman and Ramsey County Attorney John Choi -- who prosecuted former St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez in the death of Philando Castile during a 2016 traffic stop before Yanez was acquitted -- are both in favor of letting the attorney general take the lead on prosecuting police-involved killings.
"I think it reflects something that is really important, which is that recognition that we have to listen and act upon the call for change," Choi said.

Roundtable on race, policing envisions roadmap for reform

Full text: It wasn't long after George Floyd was honored in a stirring service beamed around the country that work resumed for both politicians and community members geared toward a goal of racial justice.
Reforms were the topic at a closed roundtable on police brutality just a few blocks west of 38th and Chicago late Thursday afternoon. Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, Mayor Jacob Frey and others listened to citizen concerns.
Walz said the meeting, which was closed to the press, was full of "raw emotion" and an overwhelming desire to seize the moment for changes to policing methods and oversight.
Minnesota lawmakers are set to convene a previously scheduled special session at the end of next week.
"To think that all this momentum is going to stop in a legislative session, that is absolutely ludicrous," Walz said.
Walz cited bail reform as one area where he sees the potential for bipartisan collaboration.
Omar also joined in the roundtable at Sabathani Community Center. The Minneapolis Democrat, joined by fellow U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, enumerated federal legislation they will push: an independent agency to investigate police-involved killings and excessive use of force, and emergency funds to help rebuild neighborhoods where properties were set ablaze or looted.
Frey said a road map for reform is taking shape but that the Minneapolis police union's contract is likely to be the stumbling block. City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison said the city needs to "dramatically reimagine" how it keeps residents safe and consider "if policing is needed at all."
While Minneapolis streets have largely been calm in recent nights, protests around the country in response to Floyd's death have continued to roil some cities. That includes in Fargo, N.D., where there has been violence amid protesting that prompted a National Guard deployment in that state.
Walz ordered Minnesota National Guard troops to Moorhead and surrounding communities late Wednesday out of concern for potential unrest in the Fargo-Moorhead area. There is a demonstration planned for Friday afternoon in Fargo's Island Park, which organizers have pledged will be nonviolent.
Neighbors grilled food, vendors handed out canned goods and fruit, and a mood of calm prevailed at the south Minneapolis memorial for George Floyd into Thursday evening.
Many in the crowd were pleased that all four officers involved in Floyd's May 25 death outside the Cup Foods at East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue are now all arrested and charged. After harrowing days of demonstrations and outbreaks of violence, there was pride in a community that banded together.
"All I can do at this moment is hope and pray and have faith that all this is going to work out," said Latoya Showers, who'd set up a stand nearby to hand out hygiene products.
"This is so beautiful," Showers said of the scene unfolding at the memorial for Floyd, which saw a visit by some of his family members and prominent mourners including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, following his afternoon memorial service in downtown Minneapolis.
Showers she said she would be holding her breath as the prosecution of the officers gets underway.
Janice Douglas said for her, true justice would go far beyond the potential conviction of the officers. She wants to see deep reforms to American policing and immediate policy changes, she said.
"I've been angry. I've been hurt," said Douglas, 59. "But I feel like we're going forward with making things better."

Zone coverage: Reporting on the George Floyd crisis, WCCO sports director Mike Max shows he's ready for the big leagues.

Full text: When WCCO's Mike Max crawled into bed at 3 a.m. the other night, after hours of covering the George Floyd protests, his wife tried to lighten the mood.
"I hope you don't have tear gas in your hair," she said. "I don't want to wake up coughing."
Not that the station's sports anchor is getting much sleep these days.
"Your adrenaline just spikes," Max said Tuesday while heading to report on a silent protest in St. Paul. "It takes a long time to come down from that."
Dozens of local and national journalists can relate. But Max has found himself getting more attention than his peers, proving that a guy known almost exclusively for covering athletes can handle a major league crisis as well as any hard-news reporter. Maybe even better.
At one point last weekend, he was the No. 1 topic on local Twitter feeds. Almost every post sang his praises.
"We've now elevated @WCCO's Mike Max to Legendary War Correspondent in our household," wrote one fan. "He needs a scooter and a 'CCO cape."
Even competitors have been impressed.
"Mike Max needs to win an Emmy for his protest reporting!" tweeted Cathy Wurzer, who hosts MPR's "Morning Edition" and TPT's "Almanac."
One colleague who isn't surprised by the seamless transition is Frank Vascellaro.
"He knows how to deal with people under a lot of emotional stress," said the WCCO news anchor, who hosts a high school sports show with Max most Fridays. "It's not easy to talk to people who have just lost the biggest game of their lives and do it with grace, charm and humor. He can talk to anybody about anything. That's a great personality to have out on the streets."
Vascellaro also believes his friend's experience working on deadline has benefited him in covering a story that's constantly in motion.
"The timeline pressure of turning sports stories is much greater than when you're turning a news story," he said. "You're often interviewing a guy when the game ends at 9:50 and have to get the story on the air at 10:05."
Max is quick to dispel notions that there is a
big gap between covering a playoff game and unrest in the streets.
"In an emergency, what's the difference between me or any other reporter?" said Max, struggling to figure out the volume control on the new phone he purchased during a rare hour off. "None of us know what's happening. We're all in the same boat. It's not that much different from sports. You think you know the story in the first quarter. It changes in the second quarter, and then in the third. The way you process is similar."
Almost immediately after George Floyd's death on May 25, Max started discussing law enforcement and race relations as part of his WCCO radio show, "Sports to the Max," but strictly through the lens of athletes participating in rallies.
Last Friday, word got to the WCCO-TV newsroom that protesters were starting to shut down the Hennepin Avenue Bridge. Max stood up and volunteered his services.
News director Kari Patey quickly accepted the offer.
"We sent him out because good reporters are good reporters," said Patey, who also notes that sports reporter Norman Seawright has been a valuable asset this past week. "This was an all-hands-on-deck situation, and Mike has an innate ability to tell stories through people's experiences."
That's especially true when it comes to covering Minnesotans.
Max, who was born in Gaylord, Minn., played baseball and basketball while attending Hamline University. He has spent his entire professional career working in the Twin Cities.
His knowledge of the area has come in handy, whether he's explaining how protesters were getting surrounded by police near Bobby & Steve's Auto World or offering detailed commentary while driving down Lake Street as locals protected storefronts.
He learned from Star Tribune sports columnist Sid Hartman how to build a vast network of contacts that he could trust and would trust him in return. From former WCCO anchor Don Shelby, he learned the importance of taking people aside and developing a rapport that would put them at ease before going on camera. Both of those lessons have come in handy.
"I can't begin to tell you how many people I've run into in the midst of all this that I have some background with, like covering them when they were in high school," said Max, who was promoted to sports director early last year following Mark Rosen's retirement. "I've taken some criticism for not wearing a mask, but that's strategic. If they recognize me, it's almost like comfort food. Everyone wants to talk sports. It's easy to strike up a conversation."
Max's folksy approach is just one reason WCCO has been the breaking-news leader in local ratings this past week.
"Mike's got incredible heart and sees people for who they are, just like all of my news reporters," Patey said. "It's no surprise he was able to capture humanity on some of our darkest nights."
Max's secret weapon? A constant consumption of coffee, preferably half-caff. His only complaint this past week is that with so many businesses closed at night, it's been hard to fill his cup.
"He should be a spokesperson for Caribou Coffee," Vascellaro said. "This dude has more energy than the Energizer Bunny. I've never, ever seen him fatigued."
As much as Max has enjoyed working on the news side, he's not thinking about a career change.
"I want to go back to sports," he said. "But I love the fact that the newsroom now knows that if they need me for anything else, they can call on me."

Full text: Amid the heat of a June afternoon, church came to the street where George Floyd died.
His memorial service, broadcast live from the sanctuary at North Central University in downtown Minneapolis, was private. But 3 miles away, at the site on Chicago Avenue where Floyd slipped from consciousness, hundreds listened, prayed and sang along. They bowed their heads, clapped along to a gospel song, shouted, "Amen!" and raised their fists as they called out Floyd's name.
As smoke from a barbecue wafted, they paid their respects to a man most didn't know but who has become a symbol of repression and the crying need for change. Just as important, they came to be part of a movement.
"The opportunities we have were born from activism like this," said Desmond Brown, who traveled from Rochester with his wife, four children and mother-in-law. It's a moment his children needed to witness, he said.
"They will have a personal responsibility to be part of the struggle to further the goals of justice," he said as he held his 14-month-old son.
As a black man, he said he has benefited from the sacrifices of those who came before him. Now, he said, a new generation will continue to push for change that will bring justice and equality, Brown said.
"I teach my children to strive for an education, but it may not matter, because their lives simply don't have the same value," he said. "So, yeah, I'm hoping for change."
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the Brown family, with face masks on, stood amid a crowd that wrapped around the corner where memorials to George Floyd continue to grow.
Nearby, Glen Ross was paying his second visit to the memorial.
"I wanted to show my respect to the family," he said. "I want to show my support for change."
It's unfortunate that yet another black man has died at the hand of police, Ross said. But he said Floyd's death may well be the catalyst for justice and reform.
"Look around," he said. "There are more people involved -- more white people. This may be the moment."
Standing in the crowd during the service was Tyler Wagner, a white guy from Lakeville who used a black marker to write "Black Lives Matter" on his white T-shirt. Like millions of people who have protested across the country and around the globe, he said he was compelled to take a stand "for what's going wrong in the criminal justice system."
A voice boomed over the speakers: "Say his name!"
"George Floyd!" the crowd responded.
Many listened intently, respectfully, to the memorial service being broadcast. A mother wrapped her arms around her daughter.
A couple stood hand in hand. Others wandered around the memorials, adding more bouquets, more poster-sized messages.
And then for eight minutes and 46 seconds -- the amount of time a Minneapolis officer ignored Floyd's pleas that he couldn't breathe -- the crowd stood still, mostly silent, some raising their hands in the air.
The time ticked down, and down the street, Shanniel Ashford of Minneapolis looked around the crowd.
"This is humanity," she said. "It's an uplifting experience because it's encouraging to see some kind of hope and that unity is possible."
Yes, she said, she wants the four officers responsible for Floyd's death held accountable. "But this just isn't a Minneapolis problem," she said. This is about seeking accountability and justice across the country, she added.
As the memorial service broadcast ended, a street celebration began. As performers took to the stage, the crowd was reminded to be respectful.
The Rev. John C.L. Howard arrived in a three-piece suit to join the throng. "I just came from the services," he said. "It was so moving, inspiring and healing. I've come here to continue to heal."
But even more so, he said, he wanted to help mark the beginning of a new movement.
"All people are coming together," he said. "This is about humanity."
It was a moment many cherished being part of, especially after the violence of last week, when protests spun off into fires and looting that ravaged the city before the National Guard was sent out to quiet the streets and allow peaceful protesters to dominate.
Darnay Benner of Minneapolis, his wife and three children said they needed the solace of Thursday's street celebration.
"It was important for us to bring our kids here to combat the images of people being destructive," he said.
Looking down the street, he saw something totally different.
"This," he said, "is the power of love."

Full text: George Floyd's body lay in a carefully polished gold casket reflecting a struggle and a beauty bigger than any one man.
In the surrounding sanctuary, hundreds of politicians, civic leaders and celebrities gathered Thursday to support a grieving family and pay respects to the 46-year-old black security guard who gasped for air in the final minutes of his life beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer. It was a scene that sparked global anger like few police brutality cases before it, challenging a nation to confront its racial disparities and injustices at the hands of law enforcement.
"When I looked this time and saw marches where, in some cases, young whites outnumbered the blacks marching, I know that it's a different time and a different season," said national civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, referencing a Bible verse in a eulogy that roused several standing ovations. "Go on home, George. Get your rest, George. You changed the world, George."
The private service at North Central University, about 3 miles from the site of Floyd's Memorial Day arrest, followed more than a week of escalating tensions in cities across the nation, his death spurring widespread arson, looting and destruction as well as massive but peaceful protests. It came amid economic hardship and national unrest spurred by a COVID-19 pandemic that's claimed more than 100,000 lives.
A few of Floyd's family members spoke with reverence for the man they said they looked up to growing up in Houston.
As he stood behind his brother's casket, amid displays with Floyd's image and sprays of white and purple flowers, Philonise Floyd said the family was poor and didn't have much.
They washed their socks in a sink and dried them on a water heater because they didn't have machines, he said -- but he and "Perry," as they called George, were happy playing video games and football and cooking and dancing with their mother.
"Everywhere you'd go and see people how they cling to him," the brother said. "They wanted to be around him. ... George, he was like a general. Every day, he walks outside, there'd be a line of people … wanted to greet him and wanted to have fun with him. Guys that was doing drugs, smokers and homeless people, you couldn't tell, because when you spoke to George, they felt like they was the president. Because that's how he made you feel."
"It's crazy, man," he said. "All these people came to see my brother. That's amazing to me that he touched so many people's hearts. You know, because he been touching our hearts."
Cousin Shareeduh Tate said they were raised in a family that welcomed everyone.
"George was somebody who was always welcoming, always making people feel like that they were special. Nobody felt left out," she said, adding that she will miss his hugs the most.
"He was this great big giant, and when he would wrap his arms around you, you would just feel like … everything would just go away. Any problems you had, any concerns you had would go away."
All four fired officers charged
As of Wednesday, all four officers involved in the case had been arrested: Officer Derek Chauvin, who was seen kneeling on Floyd's neck in a bystander video that went viral, was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
The other three officers on the scene face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder while committing a felony and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence.
Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said a team of lawyers is working together for the family because it will take "a united effort in the courtroom and outside the courtroom to get justice for George Floyd."
'Pandemic of racism'
Floyd wasn't killed by the coronavirus, Crump told the mask-wearing crowd inside the sanctuary, but by the "other pandemic that we're far too familiar with in America -- that pandemic of racism and discrimination."
Sharpton's speech drew both quiet reflection and loud applause from the crowd in the sanctuary, including Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who fired the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest.
Also sitting among them were civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Celebrities attending the two-hour service included actor Kevin Hart and rappers Master P and Ludacris, along with several members of the Minnesota Vikings and retired NBA standout Stephen Jackson, one of Floyd's closest friends.
Before the ceremony, Frey appeared to sob as he knelt before Floyd's casket.
Thursday's service was the first of three this week to memorialize Floyd. Another memorial is scheduled for Saturday in Raeford, N.C., where Floyd was born. On Tuesday, a funeral will be held in Houston, where he lived much of his life until moving to the Twin Cities about five years ago.
Knee of racism
In his eulogy Thursday, Sharpton drew parallels between the police officer's knee on Floyd's neck and a knee of racism on the necks of people of color.
"George Floyd's story has been the story of black folks," he said. "The reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being, is you kept your knee on our neck.
"We were smarter than the underfunded schools you put us in, but you had your knee on our neck. We could run corporations and not hustle in the street, but you had your knee on our neck. We had creative skills. We could do whatever anybody else could do, but we couldn't get your knee off our neck.
"What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life. It's time for us to stand up in George's name and say, 'Get your knee off our necks.'
"We don't want no favors," Sharpton continued. "Just get up off of us."
Sharpton referenced President Donald Trump, who held a Bible this week in front of a house of worship in the nation's capital.
"First of all, we cannot use Bibles as a prop," he said. "For those that have agendas that are not about justice, this family will not let you use George as a prop."
Solidarity outside
Outside the worship hall near Elliot Park, as the service broadcast on loudspeakers, a reverent crowd of hundreds did not chant or shout, but listened with solidarity.
A local chef had secured donations to grill free food. Other groups set up tables offering free groceries and dry goods.
Many spoke of the need to focus on a problem on which the nation cannot turn its back.
"This memorial service is a way to say goodbye and honor a life, but it also stands as a public marking point to say 'never again,' " said Matt Allen, 29, of St. Paul, a volunteer offering first aid and hand sanitizer. "It was important to me to be here and engage in that collective voice."
Maudeline St.-Jean and her sons Luke, 13, and Zachary, 15, came from Burnsville to show support for Floyd's family and the struggle.
Things can change. There's hope that change can come," said St.-Jean, who is black. Though she wonders, "Will it be slow or fast?"
Though the boys were wary of attending because of the violence surrounding many of the protests, St.-Jean reassured them. "You don't have to be scared or worried. This is about showing support," she said.
Still, some in the crowd wondered if, in the coming weeks and months, the attention would fade, as it has with so many cases before.
"White people coming here, feeling sad -- what happens when all those white people go back to their jobs in the suburbs?" said Jennifer Schnarr of Burnsville, who is white and was outside the memorial venue. "People need to get out there every day."
Minutes of silence
Near the end of the ceremony inside, the sanctuary grew quiet as Sharpton urged the crowd to stand for 8 minutes and 46 seconds -- the amount of time Chauvin knelt on a handcuffed Floyd's neck as Floyd repeated "I can't breathe" before falling motionless.
As soft keyboard music filled the sanctuary, tears streamed down the mourners' faces. A man blurted out, "I can't breathe." Another man fell to his knees in grief. Family members hugged each other gently.
"That's a long time. There's no excuse," Sharpton said as the time expired, referencing the officers who helped restrain Floyd or stood nearby.
"They had enough time. They had enough time. Now what will we do with the time we have?"

Full text: Attorneys for two former rookie Minneapolis police officers on Thursday rejected accusations that their clients aided and abetted the killing of George Floyd, casting blame instead on a senior officer who allegedly ignored his younger counterparts.
Early signs of a legal defense strategy began to emerge when former officers J Alexander Kueng, Thomas K. Lane and Tou Thao made their first court appearances in the Memorial Day killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in police custody.
Each officer is charged with one count of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. The charges allege that they did not intervene when their former colleague and 19-year police veteran Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, all while Floyd pleaded with them and told them him he couldn't breathe. All four were fired after Floyd's death.
Chauvin, 44, of Oakdale, was charged last week and is being held in lieu of $1 million bail. He faces second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges and is scheduled to make his first appearance Monday.
On Thursday, Hennepin County District Judge Paul Scoggin set bail for each of the other three at $1 million without conditions, or $750,000 with conditions. But their initial appearance, normally routine, turned contentious.
"What is my client supposed to do but follow what the [senior] officer says?" Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, argued in court. "The strength of this case, your honor, in my opinion is extremely weak."
Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank, who is prosecuting the case with assistance from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, argued for high bail amounts, noting that the charges were "very serious" and had drawn such intense public interest that the former officers were a flight risk. Each defense attorney rejected the claim, and asked for between $50,000 and $250,000 in bail.
Defense attorneys said Kueng, 26, of Plymouth was working his third shift ever as a full-time officer and Lane, 37, of St. Paul was working his fourth day as a full-time officer on the day they encountered Floyd.
Video of his arrest showed bystanders pleading with the officers to stop as Lane restrained Floyd's legs and Kueng held onto his back while Floyd, cuffed, lay stomach-down in the street.
A bystander's video also recorded Thao, 34, of Coon Rapids standing watch nearby and brushing aside witnesses' concerns.
"What was [Lane] supposed to do … go up to Mr. Chauvin and grab him and throw him off?" said Gray, arguing that there was no evidence to charge his client.
Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, also attempted to distance his client from Chauvin's actions.
"At all times Mr. Kueng and Mr. Lane turned their attention to that 19-year veteran," Plunkett said. "[Kueng] was trying -- they were trying to communicate that this situation needs to change direction."
Charging documents show that Lane asked twice if they should roll Floyd onto his side and was rebuffed by Chauvin. Kueng took Floyd's pulse and told his colleagues, "I couldn't find one," according to the criminal complaint.
Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for about two minutes after Kueng's remarks, the charges state.
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, declined to comment on the statements of the other officers' attorneys.
Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, did not shift blame onto his client's partner. Thao arrived at the scene with Chauvin.
Paule told the court Thao had given a statement to investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) on Tuesday and that he is not a flight risk because he has deep roots in the community.
Thao is a lifelong resident of the metro area, is married and has children, Paule said in arguing for a lower bail.
Several of the attorneys sought to humanize the officers, with Plunkett beginning his remarks by offering condolences to Floyd's family,
Kueng is a black man who grew up in north Minneapolis with a single mom who adopted four at-risk children from the community, Plunkett said.
"He turned to law enforcement because he wanted to make that community a better place," he said.
Kueng has always lived within 10 miles of his childhood home, was captain of the soccer team at Patrick Henry High School, where he graduated, coached youth soccer and baseball, and volunteered to build a school in Haiti, Plunkett said.
Lane previously worked as a juvenile counselor at a few "juvenile places" in the Twin Cities and once received a community service award from Mayor Jacob Frey and Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo for volunteering with children, Gray told the court.
Lane also provided a statement about Floyd's killing to two sergeants, gave a "lengthy" statement to investigators from the BCA and jumped into the ambulance that arrived at the scene and performed CPR on Floyd, Gray added.
Floyd was pronounced dead at 9:25 p.m. at HCMC after first responders and ER staff worked on him for about an hour.
Frank was unmoved by Gray's arguments.
"We recognize the statements that this defendant made, but beyond that [he] did nothing but hold the victim down [and] started CPR too late," Frank said.
Lane and Kueng had responded about 8:08 p.m. to a call that a man used a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods on the corner of Chicago Avenue and E. 38th Street. They found Floyd sitting in a car nearby, handcuffed him and attempted to put him in their squad car. Chauvin and Thao arrived to assist.
While charging documents said Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the squad, Gray said Thursday that Floyd resisted arrest, "asserted himself" and later "flew out" of the squad through his own actions.
Gray said he would file a motion to argue that there's not enough evidence to prosecute his client. Oral arguments will likely be presented at a hearing on June 29, the next time Lane, Kueng and Thao are scheduled to appear in court.
"I'm not claiming [Lane] was following orders," Gray said after Thursday's hearings. "I'm claiming he thought what he was doing was right because he asked the training officer [Chauvin], 'Should we roll [Floyd] over?' Twice."
Asked whether Lane had a responsibility to get Chauvin off Floyd's neck, Gray said, "I guess the jury will decide that. In my opinion, no. It would be unreasonable for my client to go up and drag Chauvin off the deceased. … You've got a 20-year [sic] cop in the front and my guy's back there with four days and he says, 'Should we roll him over?' and [Chauvin] says, 'No, we'll wait for the ambulance' twice. … I don't know what you're supposed to do as a cop."

Full text: A new March on Washington was announced Thursday from the Minneapolis sanctuary where George Floyd was eulogized.
The Rev. Al Sharpton said the date for the mass gathering will be Aug. 28, the 57th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream Speech" that further energized the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
Sharpton made the announcement before King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, and others assembled at the downtown campus of North Central University for the first of three services memorializing Floyd, the black man who was pinned under the knee of a white police officer on May 25 and died that night.
"We're going back to Washington, Martin," Sharpton said during his eulogy for Floyd. "That's where your father stood in the shadows of the Lincoln Memorial and said 'I have a dream.'"
The civil rights leader from New York said it's time "to restore and recommit that dream to stand up, because just like at one era we had to fight slavery, another era we had to fight Jim Crow, another era we dealt with voting rights. This is the era to deal with policing and criminal justice.
"We need to go back to Washington and stand up -- black, white, Latino, Arab -- in the shadows of Lincoln and tell them this is the time to stop this."

Full text: The show will go on for Minnesota Fringe Festival, which is digital this year but will take place when it was originally scheduled, July 30-Aug. 9. There will be two ways for audiences to participate. Each night will feature one or two live performances online, hosted by artists on their streaming platforms of choice. Those performances are free. The Fringe also is raising $100,000 for the 2021 festival and has set up a digital hub that will require the $5 purchase of a Fringe Button, plus ticket charges as determined by artists. Digital hub patrons can access an unlimited number of shows, both live and recorded. Through June 15, the festival also is accepting applications from shows and performers. For those who can't wait, the Fringe is connecting audiences to online programing from the sort of artists they might expect to see at the festival. "Which Middle Name of Philip Seymour Hoffman Are You," an award winner at last year's event, will be presented free, June 5 and 12. You can register for that live, Zoomed performance by Jake Mierva and Danylo Loutchko at allegedtheatre.com. Performances by Sheep Theater, Sam Landman and other artists are currently available at their sites, as well.

A song for our moment
One of the Twin Cities' most buzzed-about young hip-hop artists, Dua Saleh, has issued one of the first singles in reaction to the George Floyd tragedy. Titled "body cast," the haunting new track addresses police brutality. Downloads of the song via Bandcamp and streaming revenue will benefit the Minneapolis-based justice organization Black Visions Collective. Recorded with omnipresent Minnesota producer Psymun, the track was posted Monday along with a lyric video featuring the names of unarmed African-Americans killed by police. In a statement, Saleh said the song was recorded last year and is now being released to "demand justice for the family of George Floyd and countless others who have had their lives stolen by the police. [I] intended to save it for a project in the future, but I can't wait that long with what is happening in my city." Several national media outlets have picked up on the song, including Rolling Stone, which interviewed Saleh last week among other black musicians in Minnesota. "The last few days have been full of emotional anguish, triggers, and mobilization efforts," Saleh told Rolling Stone. "The community is grieving." Saleh is readying a new EP, "Rosetta," for release in the coming weeks.

Floyd's own hip-hop history
Floyd was a familiar face on the Twin Cities' hip-hop and Latinx music scene as a security staffer at Conga Latin Bistro. "He was family. His co-workers and friends loved him," said the restaurant/dance club's owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. "Thanks for treating us like royalty," said rapper Maria Isa, calling him "a gentle precious funny giant." Less well known was his history as an early member of legendary Houston hip-hop innovator DJ Screw's crew. A recording of him freestyling over a typically sludgy Screw groove -- under the MC name Big Floyd -- has circulated on social media, titled "Sittin' on Top of the World." DJ Screw, who died in 2000, pioneered the so-called chopped-and-screwed technique and is widely considered one of the most influential producers and mixmasters in hip-hop.C.R.
Nick Cannon at 38th and Chicago
Some big names have come to Minneapolis in the aftermath of Floyd's death. You might have seen Jamie Foxx, Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton or ex-NBA player Stephen Jackson at rallies. But Nick Cannon, best known as the host of Fox's "The Masked Singer," showed up in Minneapolis last Friday not to speak but to educate himself, he said in a first-person account for the trade publication Variety.com. "I needed to be right there on 38th Street and Chicago where George Floyd's life was tragically stolen from him. I needed to see the people in that community -- how much love they had for their community and their people and how much pain this has caused."

Carlile's birthday celebration
Twin Cities fans have seen Brandi Carlile perform four times in the past eight months, but they got another chance last week when she celebrated her 39th birthday with a livestreamed concert, playing her Grammy-winning album "By the Way, I Forgive" in its entirety. This promises to be the first in a series of full-album concerts, done in reverse chronological order. Next up: 2015's "The Firewatcher's Daughter," June 14 at 8 p.m. Twin Cities time, at brandicarlile.veeps.com. It's a ticketed event -- $10 minimum -- with all proceeds going to the singer's band and crew. "We're continuing to pay salaries and to pay everybody," said Carlile, "so I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support."J.B.

Full text: Minneapolis City Council members plan to vote Friday on some of the first changes to be made to the Police Department in response to the death of George Floyd.
Representatives for the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and city elected officials were working Thursday to negotiate a stipulated temporary restraining order that will mandate some immediate changes and also set a timeline for the state's investigation into whether the Minneapolis Police Department engaged in racial discrimination over the past 10 years.
City Council President Lisa Bender said the city was still working Thursday evening on details of the document, which the council planned to vote on during a public meeting Friday afternoon.
If the council gives its blessing, as is expected, the order will also require approval from a judge at a hearing that is likely to be scheduled next week, according to a presentation given to the city's Commission on Civil Rights earlier this week.
"The timeline for the impact of the [temporary restraining order] is for this weekend," Bender said. "It's for immediate accountability measures for the Police Department. It's not meant to be anywhere near starting this bigger conversation."
State Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said, without providing specifics of the negotiated agreement: "We are really committed to working very quickly to making sure we can implement some changes immediately. We continue to have that commitment and continue to move forward with that."
The state Department of Human Rights on Tuesday filed a civil rights charge against the police department, citing Floyd's death. It was the first time the human rights department has launched a systemic investigation into the largest police department in the state.
In the days since Floyd died, several elected officials have publicly floated various reform proposals, ranging from defunding the department immediately to taking a slower approach and sending social workers or mental health professionals to some calls that are now handled by police.
Mayor Jacob Frey has committed to "working with the community towards deep, structural reforms that address systemic racism in our laws and in policing." Spokesman Mychal Vlatkovich said the mayor "does not support abolishing the police department."
Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, one of the most vocal critics of the city's response to the protests and riots that followed Floyd's death, tweeted Thursday: "We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department."
Bender, a few hours later, issued her own tweet repeating that message and adding that they will "replace it with a transformative new model of public safety."
In an interview, she said she could imagine a scenario where the state's investigation results in Minneapolis police eventually entering a receivership that restructures the department.
Speaking only for herself and not for the council as whole, Bender said she would support shifting from a traditional police department to a wider public safety department oriented toward violence prevention and community-based services.
In that kind of scenario, it's possible that social workers or medics could respond to some calls now being handled by police.
Major reforms of that kind would not happen immediately, she said, but are more likely to be discussed later this year or next. And, she said, they would involve opportunities for community input.
"To do this kind of big work, we need a deeper, broader conversation than we've ever had before," Bender said. "We need white people like me and my neighbors to show up in a different way."

Park Board cuts ties to MPD: Other organizations cutting ties with MPD after George Floyd killing.

Author: OTAROLA, MIGUEL; Walsh, Paul

Full text: The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board voted Wednesday night to sever its longtime relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department, adding to the list of organizations that have cut ties with the local police following the death of George Floyd at the hands of its officers.
The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Public Schools, museums and venues have also chosen to limit or end their collaboration with the Police Department in the wake of Floyd's death May 25, which resulted in the firings and arrests of four officers.
The Park Board's unanimous vote directs Superintendent Al Bangoura to immediately stop using Minneapolis police officers to staff park-sanctioned events, and block Park Police officers from responding to nonviolent Minneapolis police calls.
"Recent actions by the Minneapolis Police Department in the alleged murder of George Floyd while in police custody have severely undermined community trust in, and sense of safety around, Minneapolis Police," the resolution read. "This ... does not support the mission of the [Park Board] and has no place in our parks."
Commissioners also unanimously voted to create a new uniform for the Park Board's police force that distinguishes them from Minneapolis police. Officers will now have to wear green; a new design would need to be presented to the board by Oct. 1, according to a separate resolution.
Earlier Wednesday, Bangoura expressed little confidence that park and city police would resume their working relationship anytime soon.
The Minneapolis Police Department "has a long road ahead of them," he said. "We can't judge an entire department by the few, [but] there is a lot that is going to have to change."
The Park Board's police force is made up of 33 officers, 91% of whom live outside the city, according to the board. Roughly 18% of the city of Minneapolis is Park Board land.
During the meeting, Park Police Chief Jason Ohotto said only 2% of serious violent crimes occur on parkland.
The Minneapolis Police Department assists the Park Police when there are multiple calls at a time, something which is common during the summer, Ohotto said. Its officers also answer calls in parks in the early mornings.
Ohotto added he could not speak for the Minneapolis police if they would continue to provide that emergency assistance following Wednesday's vote.
Bangoura said the Park Board's police would need to search for new partners to cover nearly 2,000 employee hours it needs each year for events large and small. Those agencies could be the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, the State Patrol, Metro Transit police and University of Minnesota police.
The vote was held after Park Board employees read an hour's worth of e-mails sent by residents, most of them supporting the resolution to cut ties with Minneapolis police.
A visibly shaken Bangoura, who is black, said during the meeting he was "angered, devastated and heartbroken" to see the video of Floyd's arrest.
"I stand in solidarity with those seeking justice, as does the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board," he said. "We denounce racism in all forms and we support and promote justice."
The board also voted to create a safety plan that would address policing in the city's parks by June 17.
"We still have our Park Police. They will be focusing on our parks spaces," Park Board President Jono Cowgill said. "This gives us a chance to step back and really have those discussions on what policing looks like in our parks system."
Other local organizations also announced they were cutting ties with the Minneapolis Police Department on Wednesday.
The Walker Art Center announced it would no longer contract with city police for security "for special events until the MPD implements meaningful change to by demilitarizing training programs, holding officers accountable for the use of excessive force, and treating communities of color with dignity and respect."
The Minneapolis Institute of Art and First Avenue said they would not hire off-duty Minneapolis police officers for their events. In a Twitter post, First Avenue said it would "instead work with local organizations who represent our community, and who will protect and affirm Black and Brown lives."
In recent days, Minneapolis Public Schools officials said they would no longer have city police act as school resource officers, terminating a $1.15 million annual contract with the city. University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel said her school also was cutting some ties with city police, including contracting off-duty security for football games, concerts and ceremonies.
A Park Police squad car is visible in the viral video of Floyd's arrest, stationed in front of the Cup Foods while he was pinned to the pavement. Bangoura and Park Police Chief Jason Ohotto said Wednesday that the officer was responding to a request for backup, that he was across the street monitoring a vehicle and that he could not see what was happening to Floyd.
The Park Police was subject to its own public outcry in 2018 after a video showed its officers handcuffing four Somali-American teens at Minnehaha Regional Park, yelling and pointing a handgun at them. The Park Board paid $170,000 in recent months to settle claims filed on behalf of the teens.
Commissioners and Ohotto on Wednesday decried the death of Floyd and the actions of the Minneapolis police. Some said the Park Board now needs to focus on reforming its own force.
"The Park Board has a small enough police force that we can actually make some real change," said Commissioner Londel French, who is black. "If we don't do it the right way, our communities burn."

TWIN CITIES SEE A SECOND NIGHT OF RELATIVE CALM

Full text: If you listened very closely Wednesday night, you could almost -- almost -- hear residents of Minneapolis and St. Paul heave a collective sigh of relief.
More than a week after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police, after days and nights of protests and marches and fires and looting and curfews and the deployment of National Guard troops and the charging of four former police officers with murder and aiding and abetting murder, the Twin Cities experienced a second night of relative calm. While state and community leaders said much more remains to be done, there was a sense that the grip of the past week is loosening.
On Wednesday, Attorney General Keith Ellison announced the addition of a more serious second-degree murder charge against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was shown on a witness' video kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes. Ellison also announced that the three former officers involved in Floyd's arrest were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Walz thanked Minnesotans for their sacrifices to stay home and keep their neighborhoods safe, but he wasn't ready to ease up just yet. He extended the curfews in Minneapolis and St. Paul for two more nights, 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., on Wednesday and Thursday out of continuing public safety concerns.
"Minnesotans need more than ever to lean on their neighbors, show up for their communities, and add their voice to this urgent conversation on addressing our systemic problems," the governor said in a statement. "Yet they've made those sacrifices to stay home through the curfew to help keep our neighborhoods safe."
People who have abided by the curfew are creating a space to allow state leaders to focus on other priorities, Walz said, priorities such as the civil rights investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department, charging the other officers involved in Floyd's death and introducing changes that need to be made during the upcoming legislative special session.
In at least one sign of a return to normal in the Twin Cities area, Metro Transit restarted some service Wednesday morning. Buses began rolling again at 4 a.m. Wednesday after service was halted late last week over concerns for the safety of riders and employees.
Blue and Green Line light-rail service was to resume at 6 a.m. Thursday, the agency announced.
"I ask for -- and I thank you for -- your continued patience as we work to restore service," Metro Transit General Manager Wes Kooistra said in a statement. "Please know that we are eager to return to fulfilling our mission to get people where they need to go. We recognize that reliable transportation is especially important in areas where food and other services are now harder to come by, and we will do all we can to meet those needs."
Transit spokesman Howie Padilla said that despite the extension of nighttime curfews until before dawn Friday, "we expect to have service at the same levels and times as we have had during the COVID-19 epidemic."
Some bus routes that usually travel in areas where unrest broke out in recent days may need adjusting. That includes the intersection of E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue, where Floyd was detained by police and where a sprawling memorial on the pavement now dominates the space.
Various suburban transit agencies are also moving closer to normal operations.
Floyd's death on May 25 prompted many days of protest in large areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul that included acts of looting, arson and property damage along with peaceful expressions of grief and outrage. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives National Response Team arrived in Minneapolis this week to investigate who was responsible for starting the fires during the riots.
While the unrest has ebbed since the mobilization of thousands of National Guard troops and the imposition of nightly curfews, nonviolent gatherings and activities have continued largely without incident. Protests have continued -- outside the governor's residence, on the grounds of the State Capitol and outside the offices of the Minneapolis Police Federation. Protesters there demanded the resignation of the union's president, Lt. Bob Kroll.
Kroll has been an outspoken critic of the city's liberal leadership, which he faults for being anti-police and holding back on needed resources and manpower. In a recent letter to the rank-and-file, he blasted the city's handling of the riots following Floyd's death, saying officers had been made "scapegoats" for the continued violence.
City leaders, in turn, have blasted Kroll for opposing reform and lacking empathy for the communities police serve.
Other statewide unions including Education Minnesota and the Minnesota Nurses Association joined the AFL-CIO in calling for Kroll's resignation.
The Star Tribune, too, has drawn criticism. A protest in front of the news company's offices on S. 3rd Avenue in downtown Minneapolis on Wednesday evening featured civil rights attorney Nekima Levy-Armstrong encouraging people to cancel their subscription to the newspaper.
The paper "regurgitates the news releases that come directly from the police department," she said afterward. In the case of George Floyd, she said, "They put out that news release without any investigative journalism, without talking to black witnesses to get a different narrative."
The protest drew thousands of people, nearly enough to fill the city block of S. 3rd Avenue between S. 7th Street and S. 6th Street.
Chief Hennepin County Public Defender Mary Moriarty also spoke, telling people, "This is a moment in history … We in the system need your help. We need you to help us. I vow to you that I will keep speaking out about systemic racism."
Monique Cullars-Doty is the aunt of Marcus Golden. He was shot and killed in 2014 by two St. Paul police officers. She said the "media repeated multiple lies from the St. Paul Police Department."
"They're not investigating, they're just putting out false narratives as if they're an extension of the law enforcement agencies," she said. "Their goal in doing that when the police try and demonize our loved ones is to justify the homicide."

Full text: Du Nord Craft Spirits, which had already switched to making hand sanitizer after COVID-19 orders shut down tasting rooms, is now adding food and supplies donation center to its menu.
One of the few black-owned distilleries in the country, the Longfellow business, like many others in the neighborhood, was damaged early last Friday during riots after the death of George Floyd.
Several fires were set inside the Minneapolis distillery's warehouse.
"The spot of the fire has now been converted into a community asset," said owner Chris Montana. "There's so much life in that space right now."
Across the Twin Cities metro area, many small businesses -- including those that have been damaged in recent riots after the killing of George Floyd -- have started to collect and distribute food and other essential items to communities where stores may have been shut down due to vandalism or boarded up out of precaution.
Du Nord, which is located just a few blocks south of the police's Third Precinct that was the epicenter of the riots last week, had at first helped store overflow donations from a drive organized by eatery Pimento Jamaican Kitchen. But after Montana noticed some residents had begun to start a donation campaign in a nearby parking lot, he decided the cleaned-out warehouse could become the site of its own donation drive.
"Why not?" he said. "We are in a position that we could do it. We can't do anything else."
Now the entire distillery, including the undamaged cocktail room, which is being used as a volunteer lounge, has been transformed with pallets of supplies and the constant buzz of activity since the drop-off and pickup drive began this week.
"It looks like a beehive in there," Montana said.
Molly Hoskin, founder of Samadhi Yoga Mpls, rode her bike down Lake Street on Saturday to take stock of how riots had left numerous businesses along the corridor destroyed.
"With COVID going on, it already was a tough situation with food," she said. "Everything was closed or destroyed, and I was just thinking, 'What are folks going to do?'"
The Longfellow part of south Minneapolis and about eight other neighborhoods have nearly become a food desert in the wake of large grocery chains and small markets being damaged. As of Wednesday, more than 360 businesses across the Twin Cities had been vandalized, looted or had doors and windows smashed, according to a Star Tribune database.
Samadhi's studio is on S. 27th Avenue in the Ivy Arts Building, which suffered damage to its front entrance and second floor. Hoskin created a Facebook event Saturday night to collect supplies for residents on the front lawn of the building. The community response the next day was overwhelming, she said.
Deliveries were nonstop, with an estimated 500 bags of groceries donated and mountains of other supplies, she said.
"It took up the whole lawn. … We ended up having to reallocate some stuff to other donation sites," Hoskin said.
Many businesses in the Twin Cities have already had to make significant changes to their services or products as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and the recent riots have made trying to stabilize even more complicated.
"It's been hard," said Hoskin, who started her studio last year to try to provide clients with an inclusive space to practice yoga.
At Du Nord, the fires and resulting water damage from the sprinklers caused about $100,000 worth of damage to the distillery's inventory and equipment. The repair costs could end up being a lot more due to delayed future production, Montana said.
While figuring out the future of his own business, Montana is keeping his eye on helping the community. In addition to the collection of food and hygiene products, Du Nord has also started a fund to help other businesses that may not have insurance to rebuild. The fund has already raised close to $250,000. Though not exclusive, the fund is targeted to help minority-owned businesses.
"I ask myself, would this be worth it?" said Montana, referring to the damage and rebuilding that will need to happen for Du Nord and other businesses in the community. "If it meant that we can plant a flag in the moment, and tell our kids that this is when there was change, yes, it would."

St. Paul schools' cops contract reassessed

Full text: The St. Paul school board will meet next week to discuss the future of its contract with the city's Police Department, following the recent death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
"After George Floyd's murder, many are questioning the role of the police in our city. We hear the voices of our students, families, staff and community members. We want to take those voices into consideration and make decisions that are in the very best interest of those we serve," said Jeanelle Foster, the board's vice chair.
The announcement follows a Tuesday vote by the Minneapolis school board to end its relationship with Minneapolis police because of Floyd's death.
Any potential action on the contract would happen at the St. Paul school board's June 23 meeting, according to the district. The district's contract with the department for seven school resource officers is worth up to $775,000 and expires June 30.
The Minneapolis and St. Paul districts have long faced criticism over the use of school resource officers, with both seeking to transform the role from enforcer to mentor. In 2018-19, a Minneapolis Public Schools survey gave mostly positive marks to the officers, but the data also showed that school cops had more interactions with black students than their peers.
In December, the St. Paul school board unanimously approved a new contract for the seven school resource officers to work in high schools.
St. Paul Public Schools has taken steps to soften the role of resource officers by having them find ways to avoid arresting students. Past surveys of St. Paul students have found an overwhelming majority in support of police officers in their schools.

Charges for all 4: CHAUVIN NOW FACES SECOND-DEGREE MURDER ; Floyd family calls AG Ellison's move a 'bittersweet moment'

Full text: Attorney General Keith Ellison's office on Wednesday upgraded charges against the former Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck and charged the other three officers at the scene with aiding and abetting murder.
The decision came just two days after Ellison took over the prosecution from Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and followed more than a week of sometimes-violent protests calling for tougher charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who had pinned Floyd to the ground and held him there for nearly nine minutes. Protesters also demanded the arrests of the three other former officers who were present but failed to intervene. All three were booked into the Hennepin County jail on Wednesday.
"To the Floyd family, to our beloved community, and everyone that is watching, I say: George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His life was important. His life had value. We will seek justice for him and for you and we will find it," Ellison said
However, he said, he doesn't believe that "one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel. The solution to that pain will be in the slow and difficult work of constructing justice and fairness in our society."
Chauvin, who was recorded on video kneeling on Floyd's neck as he begged for air on Memorial Day, now faces the more serious charge of second-degree murder, in addition to the original charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence.
Chauvin was originally charged by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office last week.
The amended complaint filed against Chauvin stated, "Police are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous. … Officer Chauvin's restraint of Mr. Floyd in this manner for a prolonged period was a substantial factor in Mr. Floyd losing consciousness, constituting substantial bodily harm, and Mr. Floyd's death as well."
Don Lewis, special prosecutor in the case against Jeronimo Yanez, the former St. Anthony police officer who killed Philando Castile in 2016, said the nearly nine-minute recording of the moments before Floyd died showed ample evidence of intent to kill on Chauvin's part.
"Those are moments to cause reflection on whether or not you're in the middle of a wrongful death here," Lewis said. "You have George Floyd begging for his life, right? 'I can't breathe.' This is a moment of potential reflection on Chauvin's part," Lewis said. "He had multiple opportunities to change course here and decided not to over the span of almost 10 minutes."
The other officers at the scene -- Tou Thao, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- were each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder while committing a felony, and with aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence. Both charges are categorized as "unintentional" felonies.
Thao was recorded watching as Chauvin continued to press on Floyd's neck with his knee. Kueng was one of the first officers on the scene and helped pin Floyd down. Lane was detailed in earlier charges as pointing a gun at Floyd before handcuffing, and he later asked whether officers should roll Floyd on his side as he was restrained.
The charges come just days after Gov. Tim Walz asked Ellison to take over the prosecution, which until Sunday had been led by the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. Freeman stood next to Ellison as the attorney general announced the charges Wednesday, but he did not speak and left midway through the news conference.
Despite the quick pace of adding charges to the investigation, Ellison sought to manage expectations, cautioning that the cases could take "months" to see through. He also brushed off the idea that intense public pressure influenced the process.
The charges noted that Floyd was "calm" after he was first arrested and before Chauvin knelt on his neck. The complaint also noted three times that after Floyd was pinned to the pavement by three officers, none of them moved from their positions despite pleas from Floyd. Video of the incident showed that bystanders also pleaded with police.
Floyd had told the first two officers at the scene -- Lane and Kueng -- that he was not resisting arrest but did not want to get into the back of their squad car because he is claustrophobic, the charges said.
Walz issued a statement after Ellison announced the new charges. "I laid flowers at George Floyd's memorial this morning. As a former high school history teacher, I looked up at the mural of George's face painted above and I reflected on what his death will mean for future generations. What will our young people learn about this moment? Will his death be just another blip in a textbook? Or will it go down in history as when our country turned toward justice and change?
"It's on each of us to determine that answer," Walz said. "The charges announced by Attorney General Keith Ellison today are a meaningful step toward justice for George Floyd. But we must also recognize that the anguish driving protests around the world is about more than one tragic incident.
"George Floyd's death is the symptom of a disease. We will not wake up one day and have the disease of systemic racism cured for us. This is on each of us to solve together, and we have hard work ahead," he said. "We owe that much to George Floyd, and we owe that much to each other."
One of the attorneys representing Floyd's family, Benjamin Crump, released a statement Wednesday praising the arrest and charging of the other three officers and the upgrading of murder charges against Chauvin. Crump's statement came after the Star Tribune first reported the charges and before Ellison's office made any official announcements.
"This is a bittersweet moment for the family of George Floyd," said the joint statement by Floyd's family, Crump and the legal team. "We are deeply gratified that Attorney General Keith Ellison took decisive action in this case, arresting and charging all the officers involved in George Floyd's death and upgrading the charge against Derek Chauvin to felony second-degree murder."
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also released a statement in support of the new charges.
"That George Floyd's plea -- that his struggle to survive -- went unrecognized and unaided by not just one but four officers will live forever as the most chilling moments in our city's history," Frey said. "Failing to act amounted to a failure to recognize George's humanity."
Attorney Eric Nelson, who is representing Chauvin, declined to comment. Chauvin remains in custody at the state prison in Oak Park Heights.
Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, released a statement Wednesday stating that his client was asked at 1:20 p.m. to turn himself in; he is being held at the Hennepin County jail. Plunkett, who represented former Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor when he was tried and convicted in 2019 for fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond, declined further comment.
Attorney Earl Gray, who is representing Lane, also declined to comment. Gray represented Yanez when he was tried and acquitted in 2017 for fatally shooting Castile.
Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, could not be reached for comment.
Floyd's family and Crump, their lawyer, called the new charges "a significant step forward on the road to justice, and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd's body was laid to rest … That is a source of peace for George's family in this painful time."
They urged Ellison to continue the investigation and upgrade the charges to first-degree murder, which carries a potential life sentence.
First-degree murder requires proof of planning out the crime. Second-degree unintentional murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years. Murder in the third degree has a maximum 25-year sentence. Charges of aiding and abetting carry the same maximum penalties as the underlying crime.
"These officers knew they could act with impunity, given the Minneapolis Police Department's widespread and prolonged pattern and practice of violating people's constitutional rights," the family's statement said. "Therefore, we also demand permanent transparent police accountability at all levels and at all times."
The family thanked the "outpouring" of support it has received, which manifested in days of huge protests across the country and world.
"Our message to them: Find constructive and positive ways to keep the focus and pressure on," they said. "Don't let up on your demand for change."
The former officers' prosecution is the quickest in Minnesota history against officers on the job who have killed civilians, and is the first time more than one officer involved in such an incident has been criminally charged. Three officers have previously been charged with killing a civilian on the job; Noor was convicted at trial while two were acquitted.
"Let me be honest here, our country has under-prosecuted these matters in Minnesota and throughout the country," Ellison said. "We can't control the past. All we can do is take the case that is in front of us right now and do our good-faith best to bring justice to this situation, and we will."

County autopsy: Floyd had virus, not factor in death

Full text: The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office released the full autopsy results performed on George Floyd with his family's permission.
The release comes nine days after Floyd died following his detention on the pavement by police at a Minneapolis intersection and as crucial differences surfaced Monday with outside autopsy findings released by family attorney Benjamin Crump.
Also disclosed by the report was that Floyd tested positive for COVID-19 in early April, although the autopsy did not cite that as a factor in his death.
"Since … positivity for [COVID-19] can persist for weeks after the onset and resolution of clinical disease, the autopsy result most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent … positivity from previous infection," the report said based on the autopsy performed by the medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker.
Floyd repeatedly told officers that he was unable to breathe while he was restrained before he lost consciousness and died. A concern with SARS-CoV-2 infection is that it can cause scarring in the lungs that results in lingering respiratory problems and shortness of breath. However, doctors worry more about that long-term problem in severe COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization, and doctors expect that patients with asymptomatic cases will fully recover. It can take weeks in some cases, though, before X-rays show that lungs have recovered.
The release of the 20-page report comes "with the consent and cooperation of Mr. George Floyd's family and their legal representatives," the examiner's office said in a statement that noted a court order was also needed.
The key difference between the medical examiner's findings and those of the autopsy arranged by the family is whether Floyd died from asphyxia.
The medical examiner made a point last week to say no, while the second report's findings focused heavily on asphyxia being caused by officer Derek Chauvin pinning Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes with his knee while officer Thomas Lane put his weight on the 46-year-old's back and constricted his chest.
Before releasing its full report, the examiner's office summarized in two public disclosures that Floyd died as a result of "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." It also listed "arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease," as well as fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use as "other significant conditions."
The medical examiner appeared to back his conclusion that Floyd was not asphyxiated by listing a host of injuries that were absent, in particular petechiae, or pinpoint-size red spots caused by broken blood vessels that can be a sign of asphyxiation.
Staff writers Jeremy Olson and Liz Navratil contributed to this report.

Full text: It has been an emotional nine days since Valerie Castile's daughter alerted her to the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck on Memorial Day for more than eight minutes before he died.
The video felt like a sickening dj  vu: Another black man killed at the hands of a Twin Cities police officer, and filmed for the world to see. It was like four years ago, when her son, 32-year-old Philando Castile, was shot five times by officer Jeronimo Yanez after a traffic stop in Falcon Heights.
When Castile watched the video, she cried.
When she was invited to speak at a protest in downtown Minneapolis last week, the day before her 64th birthday, she spoke, even though she's avoided crowds during the coronavirus pandemic.
When she saw protests turn violent, she wasn't surprised: "I've said it time after time. You cannot keep treating people this way. They're going to rebel. I knew this day would come. George Floyd was the straw that broke the camel's back."
When Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Wednesday announced a harsher charge against Chauvin -- second-degree murder -- and charges against the three other officers, she cheered.
And yet all this is, she said, "really meaningless" -- unless it's accompanied by drastic systemic changes in police departments around Minnesota and the country. By that, she means amending use-of-force guidelines, including community members in police advisory boards, and not responding to nonviolent incidents -- her son's traffic stop, or Floyd being accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill -- with aggressive tactics.
"For years, I've cried for other women's children," Castile said Wednesday, not long after charges were announced for the three other officers. "When that happened to me with Philando, I hardly had tears to shed for him. Because I was all cried out. And this just broke my heart all over again, to see such a brazen murder in broad daylight, and people asking this fool to get up off the man. That's just too much."
The image of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck brought to mind a sickening comparison for Castile: It looked like a hunter sitting on top of a deer that he'd just slain.
"That's what went through my mind," she said. "He's sitting on that man like he done killed his prize trophy. Arrogant -- just arrogant. Boastful. Inhumane. All of that."
As she spoke, a dog barked. It was Julio, a Morkie -- a mix between a Maltese and Yorkshire terrier -- that Castile got after her son's death. Julio was the one of Philando's nicknames.
The barking nearly woke up her napping granddaughter. Her granddaughter is named Philandra, after her slain son. Philandra turns 2 in August.
"She's all I got left," Castile said. "I can't live without her."
She was pleased that the four police officers were immediately fired. She was heartened that Gov. Tim Walz didn't militarize the Twin Cities with federal troops after protests turned violent. She was saddened that civic leaders weren't talking with President Donald Trump: "He should be concerned: 'How can we mend this thing? How can we get this right?' I don't hear any conversation like that."
One night this week, she was in Philando's old room in her Brooklyn Park house. She came across a 30-page report from the Governor's Council on Law Enforcement and Community Relations, submitted on Sept. 29, 2017. There were plenty of recommendations: implicit and explicit bias training for police officers, bringing special prosecutors to partner with county attorneys in police investigations, promoting de-escalation strategies among police, working more closely with community leaders.
"I said, 'Oh my God, here it is in black and white,' " she said. "You can make all the recommendations in the world. But they're gathering dust. You just gotta pull it out and dust it off."
Her top priority is having community advisory boards. She wants these boards to be diverse and to include ex-police officers.
"I don't get it, that for the people that live here in Minnesota, there's not a community accountability board, an advisory board, that can go sit down with chiefs of police and the governor and say, 'We need to look at use-of-force policy," Castile said. "These policies are so vague, any attorney can flip those words. It's all about the word game -- who can spin the best lie. And that's who they're gonna believe. But if there's no wiggle room in these policies, [then] it is what it is. You kill somebody, you go to jail."
Part of her feels optimistic that, this time, things will be different. That this time, people's eyes will open. She's grateful all four officers involved in Floyd's death have been charged.
But she's seen this movie before. She just hopes there's a different ending.
"You charge a person, you got high hopes, and then they slap you back down," Castile said. "If they're really sincere in really creating a different culture, really believing in what they're saying about accountability, and there being consequences about the things that you do, then yes. By all means. I hope they do. I pray that they do.
"It's now or never."

Full text: Standing at the intersection where his brother was pinned to the street by Minneapolis police more than a week ago, Milton Carney spoke with a quiet intensity about the death of George Floyd.
Behind him, hundreds of people had gathered outside Cup Foods to celebrate the news Wednesday afternoon that three former Minneapolis police officers had been charged with aiding and abetting murder in Floyd's death. Charges against a fourth, Derek Chauvin, were upgraded to second-degree murder in the Memorial Day incident, in which Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes, leading to his death.
"We are glad the system is starting to work for the righteous," said Carney, 45, of Houston. "But this is just the first step. The journey is not over; the fight is not over.
"If y'all want the violence to stop, you got to give them something to make it stop."
For more than a week, the intersection of 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue has been a place of intense passion and somber reflection. But Wednesday, as news of the charges against all four ex-police officers made its way through the crowd, the scene took on an air of hope and celebration.
Music blared, hot dogs and hamburgers sizzled on grills, and people mingled in the sunshine at the spot that's become a sacred shrine to many across the globe. After days of tragedy, terror and overwhelming grief, people were feeling some joy again.
"This is a moment of change that I didn't think I'd live to see," said Rod Adams, a Minneapolis native who now lives in Detroit, speaking to the day. "This is one of those moments in this country when we can do real structural change."
"I think it's about time," said Caroline Njogu of St. Paul, reacting to the charges against the former officers. "This is why we've been here. Today we're celebrating."
'We deserve justice'
Shortly after Attorney General Keith Ellison announced the new charges, George Floyd's son, 27-year-old Quincy Mason, stood outside a downtown Minneapolis hotel with family attorney Benjamin Crump and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
"I am happy that all the officers have been arrested," Mason said. "My father should not have been killed like this. We deserve justice."
Crump said the family wanted a first-degree murder charge filed against Chauvin but has faith in Ellison's pledge to investigate and prosecute the former officers.
"We believe it was torture," Crump said, adding that Chauvin's continued application of pressure on Floyd's neck despite another officer questioning him amounted to "intent," an element of first-degree murder.
Sharpton, who will deliver the eulogy at Floyd's funeral Thursday, said he plans to call for a national act akin to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that protects citizens from police.
"It's not about piecemeal," he said. "We need fundamental federal laws."
Both Sharpton and Crump said they were hopeful, given the outrage. Since Floyd's death, demonstrations for justice have spread to all 50 states and many nations.
"I've always believed you need to fight in the court of public opinion before you can get to the court of law," Crump said.
Added Sharpton, "When I see young white kids out there marching … I know that change is possible."
Nearby, Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died in police custody in New York six years ago while also gasping that he couldn't breathe, said Floyd's pleas felt like "my son's voice echoing from the grave."
Although she expressed relief that the firings of the officers and criminal charges came swiftly in Minneapolis, Carr urged everyone to prepare for the long haul.
"We gonna fight," she said. "We gonna win."
Earlier Wednesday, Crump and Mason visited the intersection of 38th and Chicago. Crump's voice boomed as he spoke, rising above the hundreds of supporters and dozens of media members encircling the site.
"We are demanding justice … [for] what the entire world has seen with their eyes and cannot unsee," he said. "We cannot have two justice systems in America -- one for black Americans and one for white Americans."
Throughout the week, activists have circulated at the Cup Foods site, gathering support for their causes.
On Wednesday, a group seeking to recall Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman launched a petition drive, sending out volunteers with clipboards and signature sheets. Chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team also were circulating through the crowd.
Ann Boekhoff of St. Paul left a gift of fruit and bars outside Cup Foods, and she also brought her 2-year-old granddaughter. "I'm here to honor George Floyd," she said. "This is a very sacred place. I wanted her to be exposed to what's going on in the world."
Carmilla Peterson of Minneapolis echoed the thoughts of many.
"I think people are happy that some justice has been served, but it's not enough," she said. "There's a lingering anger, because it took the destruction of our town to get some justice."
Larry Cregg, who lives a block from Cup Foods, said the events reminded him of the 1960s, when massive protests resulted in civil rights laws being passed. But those laws haven't been enough, he said.
"This says that black people in America haven't made any progress," he said. Gesturing at the crowd, he added, "If all these people don't go out and vote, all this is for nothing."

MPD faces racism probe: STATE BEGINS BATTLE TO OVERHAUL CITY POLICING ; Waves of volunteers rush to donate tons of needed food, supplies

Full text: The Minnesota Department of Human Rights will launch an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department after filing a civil rights charge related to the death of George Floyd, who died while being pinned to the street by police last week.
The probe, announced Tuesday by Gov. Tim Walz, will look at Minneapolis police policies and procedures over the past 10 years to determine whether the department has engaged in discriminatory practices toward people of color.
"This is not about holding people personally criminally liable," said Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero, who will lead the investigation. "This is about systems change."
In a statement released late Tuesday, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo acknowledged there is work to be done.
"With the assistance of the State Human Rights Commission, we can take an honest examination at systemic barriers that have prevented us from reaching our greatest potential for those we serve," he said.
Lucero said this will differ from past examinations of the police department. First, the state Human Rights Department will work with city leaders to try to make some quick changes, she said. There will also be a longer process to potentially reach a consent decree, which can be enforced by the courts, Lucero said.
"This is not a report. This is something that will result in court action and require change," she said.
The investigation follows the arrest and charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, a white officer who knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes before he died. Three other police officers have been fired following the deadly encounter.
"We are going to establish peace on the streets when we address the systemic issues," Walz said.
The move is the first time the Human Rights Department has launched a systemic investigation into the largest police department in the state.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said an agreement with the state could be a needed catalyst for change that he considers to have been hindered over the years by the Minneapolis Police Federation, the department's powerful police union.
"For years in Minneapolis, police chiefs and elected officials committed to change have been thwarted by police union protections and laws that severely limit accountability among police departments," Frey said. "Breaking through those persistent barriers, shifting the culture of policing, and addressing systemic racism will require all of us working hand in hand."
Minneapolis police union president Lt. Bob Kroll did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Kroll has been an outspoken critic of the city's liberal leadership, which he faults for being anti-police and holding back on needed resources and manpower. In a letter to the rank-and-file, he blasted the city's handling of the riots following Floyd's death, saying officers had been made "scapegoats" for the continued violence.
Kroll was under fire from two of the state's largest labor organizations. Education Minnesota and the state AFL-CIO called for his resignation.
Meanwhile the City Council issued a joint statement welcoming the state scrutiny. In a news conference Tuesday afternoon, council members presented a wide range of ideas about how they hope this investigation could help reform the police department.
Some want to defund the department quickly, though others prefer to take a longer approach, soliciting more community input before drastically overhauling the force.
"I know you don't care what we say. You care about what we do, and this is action," said Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins.
Jenkins noted that the city as a whole has some of the largest racial disparities in the country.
Police department data also show disparities in how Minneapolis police use force: While 40% of city residents are people of color, they are involved in 74% of all cases of police use of force, according to the most recent department data available. Black people are involved in 63% of the cases.
The human rights probe came as Democratic state lawmakers rolled out policing reforms that they said should be a centerpiece of the special legislative session expected this month, a push that Walz endorsed. The proposals mirror some of the recommendations outlined in a February report produced by a 16-member task force on deadly police encounters, led by state Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Attorney General Keith Ellison, who has taken over the prosecution of Chauvin.
Lucero said her agency will also look into state-level changes. Some of those could involve legislative action, Lucero said, such as eliminating the ban on residency requirements. That ban has allowed Minneapolis to reach a point where just under 7% of officers live in the city, according to its human resources department.
Chauvin and three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest on Memorial Day are under investigation by state prosecutors and by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI, which is determining whether Floyd's constitutional rights were violated. Lucero said her department's investigation is focused on state law, and she is not sure whether there also will be a federal civil rights investigation.
The state's effort to enter into a binding agreement on discrimination and use of force is not the first move to curb alleged police abuses in Minneapolis. The Police Department entered into a federal mediation agreement with the U.S. Justice Department in 2003 aimed at addressing a host of police issues such as use of force, diversity and race relations. It was billed as a way to soothe community tensions inflamed by the fatal police shooting of a machete-wielding Somali man in March 2002, followed by a riot a few months later in north Minneapolis.
Arradondo, who was involved in the pact's negotiations, said at the time that he was willing to revisit the agreement, but it's unclear which of the reforms have been enacted.
That agreement outlined some critical areas of improvement, notably use of force and how officers handle suspects who are dangerously mentally ill. But critics say that the city for years fell behind on commitments in other areas: disciplining officers who were repeated targets of citizen complaints; providing culturally sensitive training across the department; hiring and keeping minority and female officers; and creating a forum for ongoing dialogue after the agreement expires.
Over the years, the agreement led to changes in the police department's policy on use of force and improvements in mental health training, while ending the controversial practice of transporting suspects in squad cars with K-9s, city officials say.
But a civilian oversight body, considered the centerpiece of that mediation agreement, dissolved in 2008 amid questions of its effectiveness.
Minneapolis Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel said changing the department has taken years, and that the city can't achieve reform on its own.
"Every time we let a black man's murder at the hands of the state go unpunished, we chip away a piece of the soul of this country," she said. "George Floyd should not have died. He died calling out for his mother. Let's do the work so that no other black mom has to go through life without her son."

Kendricks prods NFL to do more: Vikings LB criticizes commissioner's statement on George Floyd's death.

Full text: Through his leadership role on the Vikings' social justice committee, his partnership with the Sheridan Story to fight childhood hunger and his recent efforts to help those affected by COVID-19 through sales of his artwork, linebacker Eric Kendricks has worked for several years to address systemic inequalities he's encountered.
With a series of social media posts Tuesday morning, he called on the NFL to do the same.
Kendricks took to Twitter, asking the NFL to show its work on social justice issues, after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement Friday addressing the May 25 death of George Floyd while restrained by Minneapolis police officers.
Goodell's statement expressed condolences to Floyd's family, adding the reaction of protesters in Minneapolis and around the country "reflect the pain, anger and frustration that so many of us feel." On Tuesday morning, Kendricks joined the chorus of players criticizing the statement, which referred to the league's "ongoing efforts" to address "systematic issues." Kendrick asked the NFL to go beyond words.
"@NFL what actual steps are you taking to support the fight for justice and system reform? Your statement said nothing," Kendricks wrote in a Twitter thread later shared by teammate Anthony Barr. "Your league is built on black athletes. Vague answers do nothing. Let the players know what you're ACTUALLY doing. And we know what silence means."
Kendricks then said the Vikings have "opened a dialogue with players and we're all working toward solutions with the team," before asking for suggestions from Twin Cities residents about ways the team can support the city.
"Our team doesn't just want to donate -- we want to work with local organizations and get out there to help facilitate change," he wrote. "But we want answers at the league level. That's where change can happen, and we've seen none. Because right now, it seems like nothing. And nothing is unacceptable. You can't bring in people to teach us how we should interact with police but not work towards changing the behavior of the police themselves. Silence will not make this go away. @NFL #WeWantAnswers #BlackLivesMatter."
Goodell and the NFL have been taken to task in recent years for their handling of race issues, including players such as Colin Kaepernick protesting police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem and a lack of diversity in the league's coaching ranks.
The Vikings released a statement last Wednesday afternoon offering condolences to Floyd's family, and coach Mike Zimmer released a statement through the team Tuesday, supporting "peaceful protests." The Vikings also retweeted Kendricks and Barr's messages about players opening a dialogue with the team and soliciting suggestions for ways to support the Twin Cities.
After President Donald Trump said in September 2017 that NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality should be removed from the league, Vikings owners Zygi and Mark Wilf linked arms with players on the team's sideline before a home game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They later committed $250,000 of their own money to a social justice fund that players could use at their own discretion. Kendricks and Barr assumed leadership roles on the team's new social justice committee in 2018.
The team announced in January its social justice committee approved a $35,000 grant for All Square, a south Minneapolis grilled-cheese shop that provides jobs to those returning from prison to society.
The committee also has organized visits to the Hennepin County Juvenile Detention Center to talk to teenagers there. Kendricks shared stories of his father's struggles with drug addiction and how his mother, Yvonne Thagon, kept their family together during that time.
"I just told them, 'Hey, if you guys ever feel like giving up, use me as an example.' " he said in Dec. 2018. "The skills we learn, the things we do, we learn from somebody. These kids are good kids; they just happened to be in the wrong situation."

Full text: As the world sees images of soldiers and armored vehicles patrolling Minneapolis streets, an even larger army is quietly gathering strength. Their mission: to put out financial and emotional fires still smoldering after last week's violent protests.
Lines of vehicles stretched 14 blocks after Sanford Middle School requested 85 bags of food to help families after local stores were looted and burned. They wound up with 20,000 bags of bread, fruit and more.
All My Relations Arts on Franklin Avenue has been transformed from a gallery into a food pantry that the Native American Community Development Institute plans to operate until at least October.
A refrigerated truck carrying 18 tons of fresh produce rolled into a Cub Foods parking lot Tuesday, a gift from the Zakat Foundation, a Muslim charity based in Chicago.
The sheer scope of support, pouring in from Minnesota and the nation, has surprised and relieved exhausted Minneapolis communities.
"These people are coming out of nowhere," said Mark Graves, director of the Southside Village Boys & Girls Club, watching a group of young men who spontaneously offered to unload groceries from a Richfield food drive Tuesday.
"I haven't seen anything like this in the 40 years I've lived in south Minneapolis," Graves said. "This is the positive stuff that people around the country need to see. In a time you want to give up hope, this is the stuff that makes you not want to give up hope."
Hope is coming in ways big and small to Minneapolis neighborhoods, reeling from the torching and looting that erupted after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25. Individuals show up with brooms. Neighbors form night watch committees. Suburban gyms collect diaper donations. Nonprofits orchestrate volunteers to scrub graffiti.
Top priority is food
The Southside Boys and Girls Club, like so many organizations, has morphed into an emergency support center during this crisis that has left a community with no major grocery stores, limited transportation and unemployment reaching new heights as more than 150 businesses were damaged or destroyed.
Their gymnasium became a food distribution center this week because the Boys and Girls Club in the Little Earth community ran out of space from the flood of donations, Graves said.
The Little Earth community center, packed with cereal, soup and diapers, served 1,000 Little Earth residents as well as 7,500 people from the nearby neighborhoods -- turning away donations for the first time ever, said Millie Hernandez, Little Earth Youth Development Center director.
People picking up bags of groceries said they were desperate with neighborhood grocery stores destroyed.
"I am so thankful," said Robin Keaton, 64, as she looked over the bags.
Chris Foreman, 47, of Apple Valley, brought his two teenage daughters to sort and organize donations. The Army Ranger served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said troops would never do to captured Taliban what Minneapolis police did to George Floyd.
"I needed to come out here to help the community and I think that's what all Minnesota should do," he said. "There is Minnesota goodness out there, but that label [Minnesota Nice] papers over … the inequities."
A mile away, at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Jackson Odenbach, 17, and five of his co-workers from an insurance company near La Crosse, Wis., arrived Tuesday after driving nearly three hours to volunteer. He stood at a table piled high with tortillas and trail mix.
Earlier in the day, Odenbach had seen a woman waiting for about half an hour. He held up a package of baby formula and asked if she needed it.
"She just started crying," he said.
All My Relations Arts gallery was emptied last week in case the riots came to its Ventura Village neighborhood. The space quickly became a storage site for thousands of donations, from fire extinguishers to diapers to canned goods. Distribution began Tuesday morning.
"This is a food desert now," said Angel Swann, donation coordinator.
Swann grew up in the area and said she's never seen the community come together so quickly before. Volunteers have driven from reservations across Minnesota to sort the items, she said.
"There's a place for everyone to do something now," she said.
The power of one
Valerie Quintana is among thousands of Minnesotans who have created do-it-yourself volunteer projects. Last week she gathered a few friends to clean up the shattered glass outside the Target and Cub Foods stores attacked by looters arsonists during last week's violence.
She posted on Facebook that she was looking for help. The next day, 400 volunteers answered -- and they are still coming.
"This has grown really big, really quick," Quintana told a crowd of strangers holding brooms and dust pans at Phelps Field Park on Monday, the fourth day she's organized cleanups.
Quintana started the cleanup effort as a tour guide to tragedy, guiding volunteers to the intersection where Floyd's life was ended. She wanted to show the mostly white volunteers who might not typically venture to this neighborhood that it is safe.
"The broom is a symbol,' " she said. "It's a symbol of hope, it's a symbol of action."
In north Minneapolis, Sanctuary Covenant Church is another symbol of hope and a destination for those wanting to pitch in. On Tuesday, Ashley Adkison drove an hour from New Richmond, Wis., to drop off two carloads of supplies she gathered from her community and police department after seeing a Facebook post seeking help.
"When you see something as heartbreaking as this, the only option is to help," said Adkison, a bakery owner.
The church had planned to start a daily barbecue to offer meals to residents, but when strangers such as Adkison started pulling up with groceries, it transformed into a broader effort that now serves about 1,000 people a day across the street from a now-shuttered Cub Foods store.
"People have come from literally every part of the cities," said Pastor Edrin Williams, as church volunteers directed traffic. "The response to help is incredible, but the need is also incredible."
The business community, in particular, has felt that painful need. More than 46,000 Minnesotans responded, donating more than $3.8 million to date to the Lake Street Council to distribute to business owners whose livelihoods were damaged or destroyed.
While grateful for the support, and uplifted by it, the aid cannot meet the financial needs caused by the devastation, neighbors said. Even as donations pour in, they do so on streets that still have the faint smell of smoke and where rubble is still piled high on the sites of former businesses.
Neighbors hope Minnesotans don't forget them after the current crisis has passed.
Said Graves: "There are so many needs."

Full text: Minneapolis Public Schools has severed its decadeslong relationship with the city's police department in response to the death of George Floyd in police custody.
The school board voted unanimously Tuesday to terminate the MPD's contract to provide school resource officers. The district will cease further negotiations with the department and Superintendent Ed Graff must come up with a new plan for school safety by the board's Aug. 18 meeting.
"I value people and education and life," school board chairwoman Kim Ellison said in an interview. "Now I'm convinced, based on the actions of the Minneapolis Police Department, that we don't have the same values."
"I firmly believe that it is completely unnatural to have police in schools," school board member Kimberly Caprini said during the meeting.
In a statement, MPD Deputy Chief Erick Fors said they will continue to work with MPS on security and safety issues.
"The relationships that were built were impactful not only for the students and staff, but for the officers who had a calling to work with our youth through mentorship and engagement."
The Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts have long faced criticism over the use of school resource officers, with both seeking to transform the role to be more of a mentor than an enforcer. In 2018-2019, a Minneapolis Public Schools survey gave mostly positive marks to the officers, but the data also showed that school cops had more interactions with black students than their peers.
The state's third-largest school district has contracted with Minneapolis police since 1967, a district spokeswoman said, except from 2004-2009, when it worked with park police. Under the current contract, the district was paying Minneapolis police $1.1 million annually for its services.
Earlier Tuesday, a few hundred people -- including Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar -- gathered outside the district's headquarters to voice support for the move.
"Police brutality doesn't just happen in the streets here in Minneapolis. It happens in our schools," Omar said. "Enough is enough."
A group of North High School students spoke against the removal of school resource officers. Their school resource officer, who is also their football coach, is "like a father," they said.
"With SROs being gone, nobody's going to feel safe at school," one of the students said. Board member KerryJo Felder offered an amendment during Tuesday's meeting to give North and Henry high schools the option to keep their officers. It failed.
Ellison noted that police response time will be slower without school resource officers if an incident occurs. But, she said, this is a matter of values.

Misinformation in Floyd death troubling

Full text: On the morning of May 26, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder sent a brief statement to reporters under the subject line: "Man Dies After Medical Incident During Police Interaction."
According to Elder, a suspected money forger had "physically resisted" arrest. And after police managed to get him into handcuffs, the officers "noted he appeared to be suffering medical distress."
The man was George Floyd. And a source of the medical distress was the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, pinning Floyd to the ground by the neck almost eight minutes as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe -- all details th at emerged hours later when bystander video surfaced online and went viral.
The statement came hours before the first video of the encounter went viral -- the moment they lost control of the narrative, and the public took over. Some city politicians, including Council Member Jeremy Schroeder, say they are still searching for answers as to the source of the false information.
"It is deeply concerning that the information initially circulated by the Minneapolis Police Department early Tuesday morning did not fully reflect the horrifying circumstances surrounding George Floyd's death," said Schroeder. "The original news release did not in my view accurately convey the facts or the role of the officers in this tragedy."
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said this week that he did not know the original source of the information contained in the news release.
"I'm committed as we move forward that we will do better to make sure we are getting as much factual information out in a timely matter as we can."
Elder said in an interview late Tuesday night that when he goes to a scene, information is fluid and the officers involved can't be interviewed by a public information officer.
"We try very hard to get information out as quickly as possible that is wholly honest and correct," he said. "There is no way I'm going to lie about a situation that is on body camera and is going to prove this department to be disingenuous."
The most credible accounts of what happened that night came from bystander video and private surveillance footage, later supplemented by a criminal complaint. Minneapolis officers arrived at the intersection of 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue. They removed Floyd from a vehicle, handcuffed him and walked him across the street. While they attempted to get him into a squad car he went to the ground. A bystander video then shows officer Derek Chauvin pinning down Floyd by his neck while two other officers, J Alexander Keung and Thomas Lane, hold him down at his legs and back. Officer Tou Thao stands by.
"Please, I can't breathe," Floyd pleads repeatedly.
"He is human, bro," bystanders shout at the officers. "He's not even resisting arrest right now, bro. You're [expletive] stopping his breathing right now, bro. You think that's cool?"
"Look at him," another cries as Floyd becomes unresponsive.
After seeing the video, city leaders quickly condemned the police actions and Arradondo fired the officers. Protests have erupted across the Twin Cities, culminating Thursday night with crowds breaking into the Third Precinct police headquarters and lighting it on fire. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Mary Moriarty, chief public defender in Hennepin County, said her office frequently deals with cases where Minneapolis police officers provide official accounts of arrests later proven to be false by video evidence.
"Am I at all surprised that the police lied in their report? No," she said.
Moriarty also said she wasn't surprised to see Chauvin pinning down Floyd in what city officials have criticized as an unsanctioned form of restraint.
"We look at bodycam, we look at dashcam, and we frequently see officers put their knees in a client's back or neck," she said. "And it is troubling. It's extremely troubling."

DFL leaders want police reform at top of special session: "We are at a critical point," lawmakers say as Floyd's death revives policing proposals from AG task force.

Full text: A visibly emotional group of Democratic state lawmakers demanded Tuesday that policing reform be a centerpiece of the special legislative session expected this month.
Speaking on the front lawn of the Hallie Q. Brown Community Center in St. Paul, House Democratic leadership and members from its People of Color and Indigenous Caucus outlined a sweeping package of nearly two dozen policy proposals that they argued now must be heard after last week's death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.
The proposals mirror some of the recommendations outlined in a February report produced by a 16-member task force on deadly police encounters led by state Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Attorney General Keith Ellison, who has taken over the prosecution of Derek Chauvin, who faces murder charges in Floyd's death.
"We are at a critical point," said state Rep. Ruth Richardson, DFL-Mendota Heights. "What's happening in our cities right now is about … that legacy of pain, the legacy of murder, the legacy of lynching that continues today. It's 2020: if you're not going to listen to us today, you're never going to listen to us."
Gov. Tim Walz is expected to call lawmakers back to the State Capitol by June 12 for an extension of the state's peacetime emergency, declared in March amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The passage of a major public works bonding bill was left undone in May and was expected to be a focal point of the session. But some DFL House and Senate leaders have since suggested that failure to advance policing reform would stall any other work.
State Rep. Carlos Mariani, a St. Paul Democrat who chairs the House's public safety committee, said Tuesday that the governor told him he expected policing reform to be part of any upcoming special session.
"Quite frankly it's a false proposition at this point in time to say that the Minnesota Legislature would convene and not address this issue," Mariani said. "There are no other issues more important than the public safety and well-being of Minnesotans and our communities. So yes, this rises to … the highest level of responsibility for us in the coming session."
DFL lawmakers are pushing for changes in the way officer-involved deaths are investigated. The lawmakers also want to give the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension more leeway to investigate police killings. Other proposals include citizen oversight councils for law enforcement, more oversight of the Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) board's officer licensure and training, lifting a state ban on local-residence requirements for police officers and ordering the POST board to develop a model policy on use of force in responding to peaceful protests.
"We're talking about our lives; we're talking about our existence," said state Rep. Hodan Hassan, a Democrat from south Minneapolis, who later added: "Every single one of us should be on the right side of this fight. We should all be outraged, we should all be angry. We should demand the four officers to be behind bars. We should fight for justice. No justice, no peace."

Floyd family attorney blasts county autopsy

Full text: An attorney for the family of George Floyd, a black man killed by Minneapolis police, blasted official autopsy results that differed from the conclusions of pathologists hired by his family, and called for protesters to "take a breath" and demonstrate peacefully.
Attorney Benjamin Crump made the remarks during a Tuesday news conference on the Floyd case. He and co-counsel S. Lee Merritt are also representing the families of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, black Americans killed recently by civilians and police, respectively.
Crump accused the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office of going to "great length" to obscure the cause of Floyd's death. He said the office suggested there was no trauma to Floyd's trachea after officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for several minutes on May 25 as Floyd and bystanders begged him and three other officers to stop.
"We know this is going to play out continuously through this trial," Crump said of the diverging autopsy results. "Attorney General Ellison's office is all over it."
Chauvin was charged last week with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Ellison's office declined to comment Tuesday on the autopsy reports.
Floyd's attorneys on Monday released the results of a private autopsy which found that Floyd died of asphyxia, which occurs when oxygen flow is cut off.
Officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng pinned Floyd stomach-down in the street as Chauvin knelt on his neck and officer Tou Thao stood watch. All four have since been fired.
The officers had responded about 8 p.m. to a call of a man allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at Cup Foods at Chicago Avenue and E. 38th Street.
The medical examiner's office issued its final public autopsy report Monday, stating that Floyd died from "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." In short, it concluded that Floyd suffered a heart attack while being restrained and noted heart disease, "fentanyl intoxication" and some previous methamphetamine use as "significant conditions."
Both autopsies found that Floyd died of homicide.
Citing Minnesota law and the investigation, the county declined to elaborate on the cause of death or respond to Crump's comments.
Crump called the toxicology results a "red herring."
"That is an attempt to assassinate his character," he said.
Asked if Ellison has committed to using the private autopsy in his investigation into the officers, Crump said the attorney general "wants to look at all of the autopsies and all of the science as they build their case."
Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Ellison would lead the investigation and prosecution, aiding the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.
Crump called for protesters who have taken to the streets across the country and world to cease the destruction and looting that damaged more than 300 metro businesses, including the Minneapolis police Third Precinct.
"What he needed was breath," Crump said of Floyd. "The family's asked everybody to take a breath -- just to take a breath for peace, take a breath for justice. If George was here, he would be asking people to peacefully protest.
"Just follow the example of George, America, and take a breath and try to heal our country."
Merritt called on President Donald Trump and law enforcement to follow suit.
"What we're asking from the highest executive office in this country and from policing agencies, from the National Guard, is to take a breath," Merritt said. "We are all here because law enforcement refused to do what they were trained to do, what humanity dictates they do, which is to de-escalate."

Full text: An Illinois man who came to Minneapolis to riot over the weekend livestreamed himself handing out explosives, destroying property and appearing to set a Sprint store on fire, according to charges filed in the U.S. District Court of Minnesota on Monday afternoon.
Matthew Lee Rupert, 28, is charged with civil disorder, possession of unregistered explosives and participating in and organizing riots, making him the first to face federal prosecution for allegedly taking part in the fires, looting and other violence that engulfed the Twin Cities since the death of George Floyd in police custody.
Last Thursday night, Rupert, of Galesburg, Ill., posted on his public Facebook page an invitation for "goons" to join him in traveling to Minneapolis, where he said he was renting hotel rooms and planned to wreak havoc and "take hella good videos."
The livestreamed videos, cited as evidence by FBI investigators in the complaint, show his role in the riots on Friday night and early Monday, including distributing explosives and then announcing, "He's throwing my bombs ... they're going to bomb the police with them."
"Good shot, my boy," he shouted after one of the explosions, according to the complaint. "We came here to riot," he declared later.
Later in the night, Rupert asked for lighter fluid and entered a Sprint store, according to the complaint. "I lit it on fire," he said, before entering an Office Depot and stealing items from it.
In the comments section of one video, viewed more than 4,000 times, several people criticize Rupert for his actions.
"If writing a bad check gets you killed, how do you think this guy will end up," writes one, a reference to the reason Minneapolis police originally detained Floyd after a clerk reported that he tried to pass a counterfeit bill.
"Nothing like snitching on yourself like a Facebook live video," writes another.
"I love all my haters lmao," comments Rupert.
Another image posted to Facebook shows a blistered hand, under the caption, "I tried to pick up a tear gas bomb!"
On Saturday night, Rupert posted to Facebook his plans to return to Chicago and riot there. "[Let me know] who's on board I got cars we got this," he wrote, updating later that he would arrive in Chicago in two hours.
More videos show Rupert walking through Chicago hollering to people he seems to know as they drove by. In one 10-minute video, he stops in front of what appears to be a darkened cafe with a broken window.
"There's gotta be a register in there," he says. Then, spotting one, he urges someone to go in after it, and a person jumps through the broken window as glass rains down behind him. The camera moves inside, then quickly back outside. A moment later, it continues in what appears to be the inside of a smoke shop.
Videos show him proclaiming, "Let's start a riot" and "I'm going to start doing some damage," according to the complaint.
The charges say Rupert crossed state lines to participate in the riot, which makes it a federal crime. Chicago police officers arrested him at 2:21 a.m. They searched his car and recovered several "destructive devices," along with a heavy-duty flashlight, hammer and cash, according to the charges.
In a telephonic hearing Monday afternoon, a judge ordered his transfer to Minnesota to face future case proceedings. When the judge read his charges, Rupert appeared surprised at the count related to illegal explosives.
"A firework? I don't know, ma'am," he said.
A spokeswoman for the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office said that, while it will continue to pursue charges against rioters, their top priority will remain on the civil rights investigation into the events surrounding the death of Floyd.

Full text: UnitedHealth Group said it will pay for the college education of George Floyd's children and donate more than $10 million to help Twin Cities neighborhoods hurt by the riots of the past week.
After Floyd died while in Minneapolis police custody, an offshoot of peaceful protests turned violent, resulting in days of looting and destruction in both Minneapolis and St. Paul.
UnitedHealth said it would donate $5 million and up to 25,000 hours of its employees' volunteer time to help businesses -- many of them small and minority-owned -- to rebuild.
The Minnetonka-based health care giant also said it needed to "address the larger societal issues at the root of George Floyd's death," so it is donating another $5 million to the YMCA Equity Innovation Center of Excellence in Floyd's memory.
"George Floyd's death is an unspeakable tragedy. Communities all across America are struggling to make sense of what's happened and how we as a society pull together to move forward, heal, learn and grow," said UnitedHealth CEO David Wichmann in a statement.
UnitedHealth, he said, is committed to building a culture of inclusivity and diversity.
The insurance company's effort is one of many acts of goodwill following several violent days. Individuals in neighborhoods stepped up to help protect businesses, and others raised money, gathered food to give out or started scrubbing graffiti off storefronts.
United Way of Minneapolis spokeswoman Kelly Puspoki said other Minnesota companies and citizens are also reaching out to see how they can support the Floyd family and various community rebuilding efforts.

Protesters urged to get tested for virus: State health officials say such mass gatherings could be breeding grounds for COVID-19, though outdoor air could lessen the risk.

Full text: State health officials will be encouraging people protesting the death of George Floyd to seek COVID-19 testing -- regardless of whether they feel sick -- due to the increased risk of the disease spreading at mass gatherings.
A surge in COVID-19 cases among protesters isn't a given -- many are wearing masks, and protests are outside, which can diffuse the virus. But health officials on Monday said they are expecting that the gatherings will counteract some progress.
"Concentrated gatherings and loud talking, singing, yelling, you know, all of those loud vocal expressions, exacerbate the risk of spread," said Jan Malcolm, state health commissioner, though it is "mitigated ... by the fact that this is outdoors."
Minnesota reported 361 COVID-19 lab-confirmed cases on Monday, which was the first day since April 28 when the daily count was below 400. The number was likely deflated by the lower reporting that has happened on most Mondays in this pandemic, and by the closure over the weekend of the state's public health lab, which didn't contribute results on Monday.
And yet this also coincided with the Covid Exit Strategy website changing Minnesota's status in the pandemic from "trending poorly" to "making progress" -- based largely on the reduction in the growth in cases over the past two weeks. Ten deaths reported on Monday brought the state's total to 1,050 but also was the lowest single-day count in two weeks.
The threat of a new wave of cases among protesters prompted state health officials to recommend COVID-19 testing for all of them. One reason for concern is that 80% of infected people suffer mild or no symptoms, meaning protesters could spread the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 without knowing they have it.
The Minnesota Department of Health will soon issue guidance about asymptomatic testing of protesters, because until now it had asked doctors to prioritize testing supplies for patients with symptoms.
A key recommendation will be when asymptomatic protesters should seek testing, because the incubation period of the virus following infection is around five days -- with a range of two to 14 days. Testing too soon could miss developing infections, Malcolm said.
Masks have been common,
but not universal, at demonstrations, as some protesters wore them for protection while others used them to conceal their identities.
"Obviously, it's something to be nervous about and thoughtful of," said Jessica Tomann of St. Louis Park, who wore a mask at a memorial on Monday for Floyd. "It's also like there's two viruses fighting this nation right now, and it's like, 'What's more important?' It's a double-edged sword, but you've got to pick the justice you really are going to fight for, you know?"
Maria Smith drove with her daughter to E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue on Monday so that her daughter, a jingle dancer, could perform with others. COVID-19 is a risk, but the memorial "is taking a little more precedence than that," said Smith, who wore a mask while standing shoulder to shoulder with other women at the event.
Stocking clinics
Social distancing and a 51-day statewide stay-home order, which ended May 18, had been credited with slowing the growth of COVID-19 in Minnesota, which is one reason health officials believed the pandemic was still peaking here compared with other states.
Modeling by University of Minnesota and state health researchers showed that adherence to the order had reduced disease transmission by 55%, though initially they had predicted a reduction of 80%. But no modeling accounted for the death of George Floyd during an arrest by Minneapolis police officers -- and the outrage that sent people crowding into the streets.
Upon learning of the likely protests, the state Department of Health made sure masks were available through community clinics and partners if protesters wanted them, said Kris Ehresmann, state infectious disease director.
Studies have shown that cloth, nonmedical-grade masks reduce the chance that wearers spread the coronavirus to others. These masks don't protect the wearers from being infected by others, though, unlike fitted N95 masks that are being largely held in reserve for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.
State health authorities will make sure that clinics are well-stocked with collection kits for COVID-19 tests of asymptomatic protesters, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist.
Protesters can help by monitoring their own health and calling their doctors right away if they experience dry cough, difficulty breathing, fever, loss of taste or other classic COVID-19 symptoms, she added.
When it comes to the infection risk at a protest, "being outdoors is better than being in a very closed, confined indoor-type of setting," Lynfield said. "However it is hard to maintain a 6-foot distance at a rally."
Toll on black community
The potential spread of cases among protesters could be a double whammy, even though many of them are in the younger age demographic that has seen far fewer severe COVID-19 cases. Minnesotans 30 and under make up 74% of known infections but only six total deaths.
Further, many of the protesters are black, and people in this racial demographic suffer higher rates of chronic disease, which raises the likelihood of severe or even fatal COVID-19 cases. An initial state analysis showed that 23% of COVID-19 hospitalizations involved black people, even though they make up 6% of Minnesota's population.
Another problem is that black people make up a substantial share of the workforce in long-term care facilities -- and residents of these facilities have suffered 855 of the COVID-19 deaths so far.
An outbreak late last month of COVID-19 in Minneapolis' largely black Cedar-Riverside neighborhood showed how infection risks work together. Health officials believe the outbreak was sparked by long-term care workers bringing the virus from work to friends and relatives in that community.
Assessing the impact of the protests on the pandemic in Minnesota will be challenging, because it is coming at the same time as other changes in state policies and restrictions. That includes the allowance as of Monday for restaurants and bars to resume outdoor dining service, and for salons to offer limited appointments at 25% of their usual capacities.
Contact tracing by state health investigators will be challenging as well when identifying sources of COVID-19 infection for people who participated in mass protests.
Finding the sources of infections for sick individuals is only one purpose of contact tracing, though, Ehresmann said. The other is to identify their close contacts around the time they developed symptoms, so that those contacts can quarantine themselves and avoid spreading the virus further.

Ramsey County declares 2nd state of emergency

Full text: The Ramsey County Board declared a monthlong state of emergency Monday after the civil unrest, looting and arson following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died last week in Minneapolis police custody.
The declaration, which is in effect until June 30, overlaps the county's other ongoing state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic response.
"Significant threats to the health and safety of Ramsey County residents, first responders and businesses have been present throughout the violence, theft and property damage," according to a county report.
Commissioners unanimously supported the emergency declaration.
"My whole district is really reeling in these times. There is a lot of concern, fear and emotion -- all of which is justified," said Commissioner Trista MatasCastillo.
Board Chairwoman Toni Carter had declared an emergency for the past weekend, but board action was required to extend it longer.
Emergency declarations grant county leaders more nimbleness in terms of spending and response. It also makes it possible for the county to seek state and federal aid.
In addition, the declarations are critical for businesses filing insurance claims and other assistance.
County Manager Ryan O'Connor told commissioners the community is facing the biggest health crisis since the flu pandemic of 1918, the largest economic crisis since the Great Depression of 1929 and the greatest social unrest since the late 1960s.
"We have been working around the clock to ensure the safety of those who want to speak out loudly and vocally about the killing of Mr. George Floyd and also to protect the community," O'Connor said.
The county's response to the protests and violence includes deploying the Sheriff's Office to keep the peace, assisting businesses damaged by looting and fires, and launching a community resiliency project.
The resiliency project includes 18 trusted grassroots community leaders who are speaking with residents to encourage peaceful forms of expression and connect them with resources including food and basic needs.
O'Connor said the county spent $37,000 this past weekend on its response to the civil unrest.
MatasCastillo said the turmoil must be a catalyst for immediate and long-term changes.
"This cannot be as it was before. This was a system that wasn't working," she said.
She added that government stakeholders also must resist the urge to take over or duplicate work to change systems already happening at the grassroots level.
"We did a much better job in St. Paul and Ramsey County and that is because of the work and partnerships we've been building over time," she said.
Ramsey County's criminal justice reforms include shuttering its juvenile correctional facility and eliminating fines and fees for defendants and those serving probation.

$2.5M POURS IN TO HELP REBUILD LAKE ST. BUSINESSES: NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL WILL ALSO MAKE DONATION TO THE FAMILY OF GEORGE FLOYD

Full text: Donors have given more than $2.5 million to help small businesses on Lake Street rebuild in the aftermath of last week's riots that caused widespread destruction.
By Monday afternoon, just four days after the fundraiser launched by the Lake Street Council went live, more than 32,000 people had given money, with donations coming in furiously from the metro area and from across the country, said Matt Kazinka, senior strategic initiatives manager for the nonprofit, which advocates for hundreds of small businesses and organizations along the busy south Minneapolis corridor.
"It's incredible to see how much care about Lake Street and a community like ours," said Kazinka, noting that a majority of businesses are owned by immigrants and people of color. "These businesses serve so many people and are home for so many people. It's not just the goods and services they provide, but they are community centers."
The council said it will take millions of dollars to rebuild the scores of businesses damaged during the riots of the past few days, which erupted after the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man who died May 25 after he was restrained during an arrest.
Kazinka said the council will be drawing up guidelines in the coming weeks to determine how to disburse the money.
To recognize the generosity, the council said it will use its own general operating funds to make a "significant gift" to Floyd's family. All donations that come in will be allocated to businesses to help them rebuild storefronts and reopen, the council said.
Many businesses had already been struggling economically in the wake of COVID-19 closures. Then the riots hit and delivered more devastation. But thousands are stepping up, Kazinka said.
"I can't believe it," he said. "I'm thrilled about what this means for our community."
Donations can be made on the council's website or at givemn.org.
Checks can be mailed to the council's office at 919 E. Lake St., Minneapolis, MN, 55407. But the council warns it may not receive them for "some time" because mail delivery in the area has been temporarily halted.
In a separate fundraiser for the Lake Street Business Association, Edina-based Inclusivi-Tee will hold an online auction June 25-28. "Artists Who Share" will feature work from more than 40 established and new artists from the United States, as well as from Colombia, Kenya, the Netherlands, Argentina and England.

BCA begins inquiry into Floyd killing

Full text: State investigators looking into the killing of George Floyd have requested the training records of all the former Minneapolis officers who were present, as well as access to surveillance footage that may have captured the encounter that sparked massive protests and fresh calls for reform of the city's police force.
In building their case against Derek Chauvin, the since-fired Minneapolis police officer who is charged with Floyd's death, special agents from the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) sought access to hospital and ambulance records, security camera footage from the hospital where Floyd died and records of the officers' de-escalation and first aid training.
"Part of the scope of the investigation is to examine the officers' use of force, and to corroborate statements of witnesses and officers," BCA special agent Matthew Lund wrote in a search warrant affidavit. "Therefore, documented verification is needed of the injuries and attempted medical intervention."
The BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths, made similar requests in the killing of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
"As a part of a thorough investigation, BCA Agents are requesting authorization to obtain personnel files to include pre-employment psychological records, all training records, and internal affairs files for the above listed officers," Lund wrote in another warrant. Investigators also sought access to the officers' lockers at the Third Precinct station.
Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, after he was recorded kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, ignoring the handcuffed man's pleas that he couldn't breathe. A bystander recorded the encounter at E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue on Facebook Live, where it has been viewed countless times.
What started as peaceful protests after the video spread has since erupted into rioting nationwide; dozens of buildings in Minnesota were looted or torched. Gov. Tim Walz called in the Minnesota National Guard to help quell the unrest. The protests prompted nighttime curfew orders in the Twin Cities and several other cities.
Chauvin is the first white officer in Minnesota to be criminally prosecuted in the death of a black civilian. The maximum sentence for third-degree murder is 25 years; the maximum for second-degree manslaughter is 10 years. The other officers involved -- Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng -- were also fired but have not been charged.
According to the criminal complaint against Chauvin, police were called after Floyd was suspected of passing a fake $20 bill at the Cup Foods convenience store. Lane and Kueng approached Floyd, who was in a Mercedes-Benz with two other people. At some point, Chauvin and Thao pulled up to the scene. After ordering him out of the car, police were leading the handcuffed Floyd to a squad when he collapsed, and three of the officers got on top of him, authorities say. He died later at HCMC. The hospital has also been asked to turn over all video from its ER and the operating room from the time when Floyd was brought in, court filings show.
Lund filed a search warrant affidavit Monday afternoon for "all training records, specifically related to use of force, crowd control, crisis intervention/de-escalation and first aid" for the four officers.
He also sought the names of all instructors from Minneapolis police or externally who taught the topics to the officers, and copies of all training materials.
"As part of a thorough investigation, BCA agents are seeking these documents to provide a written record to the officers [sic] level of training and also to document techniques received during training," the affidavit said.
Authorities also requested access to Cup Foods' surveillance footage. A nearby restaurant, Dragon Wok, also had cameras that may have captured part of the incident.
Earlier this week, the FBI asked any witnesses who recorded footage of the encounter to turn it over to investigators.
In an unrelated incident, police are investigating the possible theft of a Minneapolis police bulletproof vest from the Third Precinct, which last week was overrun and torched by rioters. An investigator wrote in a search warrant affidavit that police received a tip that a man was sending pictures from his cellphone showing himself in a photo wearing the vest.
"The office where the Police Vest was taken from, contained items that include … classified case files of gang members, classified information on ongoing criminal cases, property such as Police radios/charges/GPS trackers, vehicle keys, a safe, scales, police bags, police vests, police jackets, police uniforms, documents containing police information/reports, etc.," the affidavit read.
Police sought the warrant to search a 38-year-old suspect's home and workplace in northeast Minneapolis. Court documents show that the warrant was executed and nothing was taken.
According to the affidavit, the video posted online allegedly showed the man wearing a vest emblazoned with the name of Minneapolis police officer J.B. Werner while standing next to a wall with "dozens of tools hanging on the wall."
Jeff Werner, a decorated 20-year veteran in the department, worked in the weapons unit, which works closely with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Full text: Two autopsy results -- one requested by George Floyd's family and the other from Hennepin County -- agree that his death is a homicide but disagree over exactly what killed him.
During a news conference Monday afternoon, two doctors hired by the Floyd family to do a private autopsy said they believe he died of asphyxia, which happens when oxygen flow is cut off, causing the brain and other organs to stop working.
"We believe truth will help lead to justice and so, despite how painful these autopsy findings are, especially for George Floyd's family, we think it is essential that the truth comes out about the manner and the exact manner and science as to how George Floyd was killed," Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, told reporters.
Hours later, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office issued its final public report, stating that Floyd died as a result of "cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." A spokesperson for the office, citing Minnesota laws, said they could not discuss that cause of death further.
The report noted that Floyd "experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)."
It also listed "arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease," as well as fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use as "other significant conditions."
It was the most extensive description released yet of the autopsy performed by the Medical Examiner's Office on the 46-year-old Floyd, who died on May 25 after his curbside detention at E. 38th Street and S. Chicago Avenue by officers who suspected him of passing fake currency at a store.
Derek Chauvin, who was seen on video pinning his knee on Floyd's neck, was fired from the force and has been charged with third-degree murder (up to 25 years in prison) and second-degree manslaughter (up to 10 years in prison).
Three other officers who were present were also fired but had not been charged as of Monday evening.
It is too early to tell exactly what significance, if any, the differing findings could play in Chauvin's case.
"I don't even know how this goes," said Bradford Colbert, a practitioner in residence at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. "It's not exactly clear to me, because in a criminal case, it's the state vs. the defendant.
Theoretically, the victim does not have the right to be involved. That's how it rolls."
Either a prosecutor or a defense attorney could choose to enter the results of the family's autopsy into evidence at a criminal trial, but neither would be required to do so, Colbert said.
The results could also be used in a civil trial, if Floyd's family decides to sue.
Little has been publicly released about how the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office came to its conclusion on Floyd's cause of death.
In a criminal complaint supporting the charges against Chauvin, investigators wrote that "the autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation."
It also noted there were "underlying health conditions, including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease."
While attorneys and doctors hired by the Floyd family did not release their written autopsy reports, saying they were still awaiting some additional results, they did describe their findings in some detail.
To come to their conclusions, they said they viewed the public videos of Floyd being pinned by Chauvin, as well as a report put together by EMT staff who worked on Floyd and examined the parts of his body to which they had access.
"The compressive pressure of the neck and back are not seen at autopsy because the pressure has been released by the time the body comes to the medical examiner's office," said Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on behalf of the Floyd family.
"It can only be seen -- serious compressive pressure on the neck and back can only be seen while the pressure is being applied or when, as in this instance, it is captured on video."
Baden said he believes that while Floyd was officially pronounced dead later, he actually died "after about 4 or 5 minutes."
Court documents filed in Chauvin's case say Floyd was pulled out of a squad car at 8:19:38 p.m., stopped moving at 8:24:24 p.m. and at 8:25:31 p.m., video "appears to show Mr. Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak."
Crump, the Floyd family attorney, said an EMT report they obtained shows that medics "performed pulse check several times, finding none, and delivered one shock … but George's condition did not change. They delivered him to the hospital, continued ventilation, but that last report was the patient was still pulseless. The ambulance was the hearse."
Baden said that they found "rough abrasions" on Floyd's left eye and left cheek "and a little bit in the front, on the nose and mouth areas." He said they also found "scrape marks on the back side of his left shoulder."
Preliminary findings released through the attorneys later in the day indicated that the doctors also found a hemorrhage "over the vertebral bodies and in the cervical region," as well as on the outside of the carotid artery and in the wrists and forearms.
"The cause of death, in my opinion, is asphyxia due to compression of the neck," Baden said.
Baden and his colleague, Dr. Allecia Wilson, disputed the medical examiner's findings of heart disease -- with Baden going so far as to say, "I wish I had the same coronary arteries that Mr. Floyd had that we saw at the autopsy."
Wilson noted that second autopsies have some limitations.
"Certain parts of the organs have been retained by the original pathologist," she said, though she didn't note which ones.
In their public statements, the Floyd family's attorneys and doctors said they believe that pressures on both his neck and his back caused Floyd's death.
Paperwork filed in Chauvin's case indicates that officer J. Alexander Kueng "held Mr. Floyd's back" and officer Thomas Lane "held his legs." A fourth officer, Tou Thao, was seen on video standing nearby while Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck.
Attorneys for the four fired officers either declined to speak about the family's autopsy findings or were unavailable to comment.
Attorneys for the Floyd family welcomed the appointment of Attorney General Keith Ellison to prosecute the case and said they hope he will consider a first-degree murder charge for Chauvin. Co-counsel Antonio Romanucci called for charges for the other officers as well. Not only was Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck, Romanucci said, "but so was the weight of the other two police officers on his back. … That makes all of those officers on scene criminally liable and, without a doubt, civilly responsible."

He needed to hear his brother's name again

Full text: In a raw, heartbroken appeal for peace following his brother's death, Terrence Floyd on Monday stood near the spot where George Floyd was held to the ground by police officers and urged people to turn away from violence.
"Let's do this another way!" he shouted to hundreds of people who had come to see the memorial at E. 38th Street and Chicago Avenue.
It was Floyd's first visit to the south Minneapolis intersection where his older brother died in police custody just one week before. With the help of several men, he staggered, step after unsteady step, to the chalk outline of where his brother had gasped for breath.
Then Terrence Floyd collapsed to his knees, and the crowd hushed as he let out an anguished scream.
He had traveled from Brooklyn, N.Y., with several others, including the Rev. Kevin McCall, who told the crowd that the Floyd family has "a long road ahead of justice."
"Just because we're doing it peacefully, that doesn't mean we don't want all four of the officers locked up," said McCall, drawing cheers.
Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman filed charges Friday of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was taken into custody that same day. Chauvin is being held at the state prison in Oak Park Heights.
Public pressure to file charges against the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest and death has grown. On Sunday, Gov. Tim Walz said he had asked Attorney General Keith Ellison to lead the prosecution with Freeman's assistance.
The protests and riots that began in Minneapolis last week have since spread to cities across the country and around the world.
Some 250 U.S. Army troops patrolled the streets Monday in Washington, D.C., the first such deployment since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.
In Minnesota, three nights of curfew and scores of arrests have quelled a spasm of violence that over the course of the week saw hundreds of buildings looted, destroyed and in some cases burned to the ground.
One person died Friday in a shooting on E. Lake Street near the riots, and dozens of others have been injured.
The site of George Floyd's arrest at 38th and Chicago has seen less violence, and on many nights last week didn't even have a police presence as mourners and neighbors constructed memorials made of flowers, posters and chalk art.
A striking mural painted on the Cup Foods convenience store at the intersection depicts Floyd and the words, "I can breathe now."
Speaking on Monday to onlookers and a crush of international media, Terrence Floyd took to task those people who have rioted in his brother's name, saying his brother loved Minneapolis.
"I understand you all are upset. But I doubt you are half as upset as I am. So if I'm not over here wilding out, if I'm not over here blowing up stuff, if I'm not over here messing up my community, then what are you all doing? … That's not going to bring my brother back," he said.
As he did when he appeared on "Good Morning America" calling for "destructive unity," Floyd told the Minneapolis crowd that people should band together at the ballot box.
"Let's stop thinking that our voice doesn't matter and vote," he said, drawing cheers. "Educate yourself."
Floyd, wearing a face mask with his brother's image, finished his remarks, thanked the crowd on behalf of his family, and asked them to keep his brother's name ringing out.
"Now before I go, I just want to hear this again. What's his name?" yelled Floyd.
The crowd roared back: "George Floyd!"

SPORTS' VOICES OF OUTRAGE: ATHLETES REACT WITH SADNESS, INDIGNATION OVER GEORGE FLOYD'S DEATH

Author: Rand, Michael

Full text: Thirty years ago, as his stardom reached dramatic heights, Michael Jordan uttered a line that has stuck with him as a symbol of his reticence toward taking political stands.
"Republicans buy sneakers, too," Jordan said in 1990, in the midst of a politically contentious North Carolina Senate race.
The implication wasn't hard to parse: By choosing sides on an issue, Jordan risked jeopardizing the support, financial or otherwise, of those who disagreed with his stance.
It was striking then to see Jordan break from his own history Sunday to offer thoughts on last week's death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police and the ensuing protests demanding justice around the world.
"I am deeply saddened, truly pained and plain angry," Jordan said in a statement. "I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough."
Jordan's comments were measured to be sure, but they are part of an overall sports response that seems to be changing in diversity and tone -- as well, perhaps, as phosoph.
While speaking out a generation ago might have been deemed harmful to a brand, staying silent as a sports figure or team during a time of national crisis in 2020 can create an impression of being complacent at best and complicit at worst.
That's not to say, though, that what's being said in the wake of Floyd's death is merely an attempt to placate fans -- even if some statements from teams and leagues read that way.
More than a moment
The breadth and passion of comments -- and in many cases, actions -- from athletes of all colors suggest more of a movement than a mere moment across sports.
Among the many voices that registered as both authentic and perhaps unexpected included that of the NHL's Blake Wheeler -- a Twin Cities native who posted an impassioned message that examined his own white privilege.
"We need to stand with the black community and fundamentally change how the leadership in this country has dealt with racism," the Winnipeg Jets forward wrote Saturday on Twitter. "I'm sorry it has taken this long, but I'm hopeful that we can change this NOW."
NASCAR driver Ty Dillon posted a similar message on Instagram, while retired baseball star Dale Murphy posed a series of tweets about his son being shot in the eye with a rubber bullet by police during a protest in Denver.
"If you're a beneficiary of systemic racism, then you will not be able to dismantle it at no cost to yourself," Murphy wrote. "You will have to put yourself at risk. It might not always result in being physically attacked, but it will require you to make yourself vulnerable."
Countless leagues and teams have offered statements, but the NBA's Washington Wizards late Sunday released what it called a unified statement from players that didn't mince words. "We will no longer tolerate the assassination of people of color in this country," it read in part, while also promising to take a stand against government leaders and law enforcement.
The Wizards statement ended: "We will no longer shut up and dribble," citing the phrase Fox News host Laura Ingraham used in a critique of LeBron James in 2018.
United they stand
Indeed, it seems more players are speaking out -- with James looming large among them. He has been active on both Instagram and Twitter, where combined he has more than 110 million followers, in condemning violence and elevating images of peaceful protests.
Perhaps even more notably, several athletes not only have been active on social media but they have been in the thick of protests and activism themselves.
Former NBA player Stephen Jackson was in Minneapolis last week at a rally for social justice also attended by Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns. Celtics players Enes Kanter and Jaylen Brown made long drives -- one to Boston, one to Atlanta -- to participate in protests.
"We stand with our players, employees, partners, and fans in being committed to championing the change we need," the Celtics said in a statement Sunday.
Activism in sports is nothing new, of course. But our expectation of it -- and the comfort level of sports figures in engaging in it -- is perhaps shifting.
Even recently, as part of the 10-part "The Last Dance" documentary, Jordan was asked about his role.
"I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in. But I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player," Jordan said. "I wasn't a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That's where my energy was."
And now?
"Our unified voice needs to put pressure on our leaders to change our laws, or else we need to use our vote to create systemic change," Jordan said Sunday. "Every one of us needs to be part of the solution, and we must work together to ensure justice for all."
What they're saying
A sampling of reaction from around the sports world to George Floyd's death and protests demanding justice and reform:
• Gophers athletic director Mark Coyle, in a statement: "I have spent the last week listening to our student-athletes and staff. They are hurting over the indefensible killing of Mr. Floyd. They are also committed to enacting change, and many of them have participated in the numerous peaceful protests and community and charitable efforts in the Twin Cities. I applaud them for using their voice and actions in a positive way."
• Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie, in a Star Tribune interview: "I hear our cries and it's just hard because as I don't condone violence, at the same time, you can't push people to the wall and expect them not to fight back. I think that's just a display of what we're seeing right now."
• Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, in a statement: "We cannot continue to ignore racism as if it has ended, or never happened. The continual violence inflicted upon blacks and people of color must stop. We need a change now. We need love. We need compassion. We need grace and forgiveness even in the midst of the pain. We need true leadership. We need justice. We need equality."
• Twins manager Rocco Baldelli, on Twitter: "George Floyd should be breathing right now. We have a lot of progress to make. A lot. Remember his name. Remember what happened."
• Twins outfielder Byron Buxton, on Instagram: "It's unbearable to even think about what's happening in our city and throughout the country, but things have to CHANGE. African Americans have been slaughtered left and right for nothing more than the color of our skin. That is reality and it has been ignored far too long. DEMAND PROGRESS -- DEMAND JUSTICE for George Floyd."
• Islanders forward Anders Lee, a former Edina High School star, on Twitter: "I will never fully understand because of the color of my skin, but I have an opportunity to make a difference. I stand for anti-racism. I stand for the rights of black people in America, so we can all be equal. I stand alongside the black community through this difficult time and in the future. I stand for the justice of George Floyd and the countless others who have been killed by racism. Black Lives Matter."
• The NHL, in a statement: "As protests in both the United States and Canada in recent days have focused attention upon racial injustice for the Black community, the NHL stands with all those who are working to achieve a racially just society, and against all those who perpetuate and uphold racism, hatred, bigotry and violence."
• Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, to thenation.com: "The thing that strikes me is that we all see this police violence and racism, and we've seen it all before, but nothing changes. That's why these protests have been so explosive. But without leadership and an understanding of what the problem is, there will never be change. And white Americans have avoided reckoning with this problem forever, because it's been our privilege to be able to avoid it. That also has to change."
• Gophers receiver Rashod Bateman, on Twitter, along with a team photo: "No matter what happens, I will continue to LOVE all kind because I have witnessed how beautiful it is when it all clicks. Moving forward, all of my brothers and sisters in this photo will FIGHT for each other and everyone else who wants to better themselves and others."

Customers start trickling in: But restaurants hit another barrier as violence forces them to close

Full text: They came for a beer. They came to celebrate an anniversary. They came seeking momentary reprieve from a pandemic.
Customers trickled in to Minnesota restaurants and breweries Monday, the first day patio dining was allowed to open under orders from the state.
"For some reason, this was my milestone for feeling more normal -- to go out and have lunch again," said Sean Gilbertson of Edina, who was having a venison and Kobe beef Juicy Lucy and fries on the dock at 6Smith in Wayzata.
The restaurant was his second choice; his first made a last-minute call not to open after days of violence and looting swept Minneapolis in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd while in police custody.
Did having a meal outside his home for the first time in months help Gilbertson feel "normal"?
"No," he said. "I don't know what would make things more normal."
The state ordered dining rooms to close beginning March 17 to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Minnesota. Later, they were given a June 1 reopening date -- with the caveat that all dining must take place outdoors, with no more than 50 guests at a time, on a reservation-only basis.
Many restaurants chose not to
reopen yet, whether due to the ongoing pandemic, a lack of outdoor seating or the economic hardship of opening to serve only a fraction of their usual capacity.
Then, with a week of unrest across the metro that saw several Twin Cities restaurants vandalized or damaged, more restaurants decided to put off their scheduled patio openings.
But after nearly three months without a seated customer, others were ready to welcome guests back to their patios and rooftops on a sunny day with temperatures in the high 80s.
It wasn't business as usual.
At Pub 42 in New Hope, there was one significant barrier for entry to the deck overlooking the parking lot and N. 42nd Avenue. General manager Rob Gossard stood at the hosts' stand, pointing a white thermometer at guests' foreheads for a touchless temperature reading. Anyone over 99.5 degrees would be sent away.
"We're trying to keep fever out of the restaurant," he said.
At 6Smith, a timer went off every 15 minutes to let staffers -- in matching gray masks -- know it was time to wash their hands.
A bagpiper was on hand to welcome guests to Utepils Brewing's tucked-away beer garden along Bassett Creek in north Minneapolis. When the first song ended, a man seated on an Adirondack chair with a beer in hand yelled out, "Are you playing that thing with a mask on?"
The bagpiper's second number was taps, to honor Floyd.
The brewery had a total of 56 bookings for the day, a slow start, said owner Dan Justesen.
Still, he was "pretty excited" as he watched over about a dozen customers at picnic tables. "We live to do this," he said.
Jacob Bell and Sara Marie Sorenson are regulars at Sir Benedict's Tavern on the Lake in Duluth and were with co-owner Josh Stotts until the restaurant's last call before the stay-at-home order took hold in March.
"There's definitely been a piece of our lives that's been missing the last two months," Bell said.
Stotts said his patio can usually seat 119 customers, but he's spread out tables to make room for social distancing. Almost all 50 seats available were filled Monday afternoon.
"We're taking things one day at a time," he said.
Tavern on the Hill in Duluth filled all its reservation slots for Monday.
"Our phone's been ringing off the hook," said co-owner Julie Thoreson. "I wish we had more room. … Fifty seats fill pretty darn quick."
More restaurants and bars will be rolling out their patios in the week ahead.
After its April debut was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, the Grocer's Table is opening in downtown Wayzata on Wednesday on a newly expanded patio that takes advantage of sidewalk footage.
Over the past two months, owner Lindsay Pohlad has made alterations to her original cafe-wine bar-market business plan by emphasizing the market aspect of her enterprise. Banquettes have been replaced with coolers stocked with all kinds of pantry staples, including locally sourced eggs, butter, yogurt and cheese.
Pohlad added that the Grocer's Table will follow now-standard protocols: a separate entrance and exit, disposable menus, cashless transactions and masked and gloved staffers.
Although opening a restaurant during a global pandemic is "surreal," Pohlad is accentuating the positive. "I feel that we've been stressed and challenged in every way possible before we even opened, so that's a silver lining," she said.
Other restaurant and bar operators made the last-minute call not to open as planned. Finnegans Brewery was prepared to open its taproom Monday, until a Sunday night decision to postpone. "In light of what is happening in our city, now is not the right time to reopen," said an announcement on social media.
Three of Craft & Crew Hospitality's four restaurants opened their patios -- but their Howe Daily Kitchen & Bar in south Minneapolis is delaying.
The online reservation system Open Table was still taking bookings midmorning Monday for the News Room on Nicollet Mall. General manager Brad Schwichtenberg had to call customers to let them know those reservations were canceled.
The restaurant, like others on the mall, is still boarded up and it will take almost 48 hours to take the boards down and prepare the restaurant for customers, Schwichtenberg said. They're hoping to open by Thursday.
Tables were set up at 6 a.m. on the patio outside French Meadow Bakery & Cafe on S. Lyndale Avenue in Minneapolis for the long-awaited opening of its patio.
But French Meadow founder Lynn Gordon changed course minutes before the first seating, suspending service to those tables. (People can sit there with their takeout.) The cafe's hand-carved wooden front doors were damaged over the weekend in a break-in.
In St. Paul, Afro Deli opened its patio on the pedestrian-only West 7th Place. Even with social distancing restrictions, it has enough room to seat 30 to 40 people.
Opening Monday was important to owner Abdirahman Kahin, despite the destruction of businesses from riots and arson over the last week.
"We want to be a solution for the unrest," Kahin said. "We are sympathizing with George Floyd and his family and we also support people who are demanding justice. We want to make sure life goes on, despite the atmosphere."
Over the weekend, Afro Deli prepared 1,200 meals to distribute to citizens cleaning up Lake Street, and partnered with Meals on Wheels and Frontline Foods throughout the pandemic to get meals to seniors and children.
Opening the patio gives back to the community in another way, Kahin said.
"Some people feel better when they see businesses that are open," he said. "We want to show hope."

Full text: Many Minnesota churches opened their doors to smaller than expected crowds Sunday, and most didn't open at all, facing COVID-19 safety concerns and civil unrest gripping the Twin Cities.
It was the first weekend that houses of worship could hold in-person services since March 18, when they were required to close in response to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. Under new state guidelines released last week, they could reopen at 25% capacity and with safety restrictions.
But even at limited capacity, many churches did not fill. And the majority of Minnesota's Catholic churches, whose bishops were largely responsible for getting the state to relax capacity guidelines, were not open at all.
Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, for example, had mass sign-up sheets showing attendance ranging from a quarter to half of its 120 seats available.
Our Lady of Grace Church in Edina, which opened with about 70 available seats, saw about 45 members for its two morning masses. The evening mass sign-up, however, was at capacity.
The Cathedral of St. Paul, which opened 250 of its 2,000 seats for each service, also had lower than expected attendance Saturday night and at two of its three Sunday morning services, said cathedral rector the Rev. John Ubel. But Sunday's 10 a.m. service was full.
"We've heard attendance is down all over the country," said the Rev. Matthew Northenscold of Our Lady of Grace. "There's a couple reasons."
Most churches, not just Catholic, haven't had time to implement the health standards required to reopen, clergy said. And many faithful, especially the elderly, are worried about the spread of COVID-19.
Catholics, who are normally required to attend mass each weekend, don't have to under a coronavirus dispensation.
On top of all this, the civil unrest in the Twin Cities following the death of George Floyd in police custody may have kept some faithful at home, said the Rev. Dan Griffith of Our Lady of Lourdes Church near downtown Minneapolis.
Our Lady of Lourdes, for example, was planning three weekend services. It later posted on its web page that mass would remain online because of safety concerns.
"Once things started to unravel, we decided to delay opening," said Griffith.
Brennen and Paige Schulz were among the faithful who ventured to worship services Sunday, bringing their son Jack to Our Lady of Peace. The Minneapolis couple acknowledged they brought mixed emotions, happy to be back in church but sad about the week's events.
That said, watching an online mass from the basement for two months was getting old, they said. "We were anxious to get back," Brennen Schulz said.
The tragedy of Floyd's death, and the destruction that followed, was on the minds of many clergy as they saw their members face to face for the first time in 10 weeks.
During his sermon, Northenscold explained that Pentacost Sunday, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus' apostles, is typically a time of joy.
"But this has been one of the most difficult and painful and challenging weeks in our state's history," said Northenscold. He asked the Holy Spirit for "an outpouring of gifts on us, on the city, on the nation."
The message at St. Bridget's Church in north Minneapolis also reflected the tense times. The Rev. Paul Jarvis didn't reopen the church but instead planned a Sunday afternoon prayer gathering at the site of Floyd's arrest.
"Peace only arises when there is justice and shared prosperity," Jarvis said in his sermon. "With yet another well-documented killing of an unarmed black man by whites, it's becoming more and more obvious that there is a lack of justice and prosperity for society's marginalized."
It was mainly Catholic and evangelical churches holding public worship this weekend. Protestants and other faiths have declined, arguing that a large group gathering could jeopardize the health of their members and staff.
Most churches from the Minnesota South District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, which joined Minnesota bishops in a challenge to Walz's restrictions on houses of worship, have not yet reopened, said Fredric Hinz, the district's public policy advocate.
Other religious leaders were taking different actions. The faith group Isaiah Minnesota petitioned Gov. Tim Walz to place the Minneapolis Police Department into public receivership "under the control of state or county democratically-elected officials" and to remove Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman from the George Floyd murder case.

Ellison: 'We are pursuing justice'

Full text: In an unusual legal maneuver, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison will take the lead in the prosecution of the fired Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died last week in police custody.
Gov. Tim Walz said Sunday that he concluded Ellison needed to take over the case from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office at the urging of Floyd's family, community activists, and some members of the Minneapolis City Council seeking a vigorous prosecution of the officer, 44-year-old Derek Chauvin.
"This decision is one that I feel takes us in that direction and the step to start getting the justice for George Floyd," Walz said Sunday. "When I spoke to the Floyd family they were very clear: They wanted the system to work for them. They wanted to believe that there was trust and they wanted to feel like the facts would be heard and justice would be served."
Ellison said he plans to "bring to bear all the resources necessary" to prosecute the case. "I just want to let the public know we are pursuing justice, we are pursuing truth, we are doing it vigorously," Ellison said.
Earlier Sunday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that he asked for Ellison's help and that the state attorney general agreed to be a full partner in the proceedings.
"There have been recent developments in the facts of the case where the help and expertise of the Attorney General would be valuable," Freeman said in a statement.
Freeman faced intense pressure to bring charges quickly against Chauvin, and Ellison told reporters that he expects the two of them will work constructively together. "The governor has asked me to take this case and that's what we're going to do," he said. "I anticipate we're going to be working constructively together."
Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in connection with Floyd's death, which followed his arrest on Memorial Day for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill. Video of the arrest showed Chauvin holding his knee for several minutes on Floyd's neck as he lay cuffed on the street near the intersection of S. Chicago Avenue and 38th Street.
Chauvin also stands accused of ignoring another officer who expressed concerns about Floyd as he lay on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe as onlookers begged the officers to let him up.
Chauvin was fired along with three other officers who were at the scene. He was moved Sunday from the Ramsey County jail to the Hennepin County jail, and then moved again to another unspecified jailing authority in the state. He is scheduled to make his first court appearance June 8 in Hennepin County Court.
So far, Chauvin is the only officer to face criminal charges in Floyd's death. Ellison said Friday that he had "every expectation" authorities would press charges against all four officers involved in Floyd's arrest. But after officially taking over the Floyd case Sunday, he said he could not talk about possibility of other charges.
"It's just too early to discuss that," he said.
The other three officers have been identified as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng. While they remain free, all four officers are under investigation by state prosecutors and the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI, which is determining whether Floyd's constitutional rights were violated.
The charges against Chauvin have not quelled protests that are entering their second week, drawing tens of thousands of demonstrators, many of them angry that he is not facing more serious murder charges or that the other three officers have not been charged.
Ellison said it is not unprecedented for his office's criminal division to take over cases for county attorneys' offices, but the practice is more common in smaller counties. The move also came just two days after Freeman highlighted his office's experience trying officers, in particular its success in securing the conviction of Mohamed Noor, a Minneapolis police officer found guilty in the 2017 shooting death of a woman in south Minneapolis who had called 911 for help.

Unfairness doesn't have to be: Giving Kaepernick a job here would squelch the lip service

Full text: This weekend, five days after a cop knelt on George Floyd's neck in bright daylight on a Minneapolis street, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement.
Either he took five days to toss a meaningless word salad, or he belatedly realized that he was among the last sports leaders to have failed to acknowledge the killing, and on Saturday quickly tossed a meaningless word salad.
I could reprint Goodell's statement here, but it might be easier for you to just Google "Generic press release template."
Ignore Goodell. He facilitated the blackballing of Colin Kaepernick, who was peacefully protesting killings just like that of George Floyd, and he has failed to persuade NFL owners to hire a reasonable number of black coaches and general managers in a sport filled with high-achieving black men. He possesses the same credibility as a new Twitter user with zero followers and a Russian handle.
Instead, today, read the piece written by Joe Lockhart for CNN.com. Lockhart worked as an NFL executive. He also worked in the White House.
Lockhart's essay exposes all that Goodell and NFL owners have tried to obscure -- that Kaepernick remained unsigned because NFL teams didn't want to anger portions of their fan base or bring unwanted media attention to their locker rooms.
Lockhart writes that he thought the NFL did good work in trying to encourage discussions about race and protest, and that Goodell at least had good intentions. "Though Kaepernick didn't get his job back, I thought we had done a righteous job, considering."
If that was the culmination of Lockhart's piece, he would have exposed himself as exactly the kind of self-congratulatory and cloistered NFL figure who has kept the league's worldview rooted firmly in the 1950s.
But he had more to say.
"I was wrong," he wrote. "I think the teams were wrong for not signing him. Watching what's going on in Minnesota, I understand how badly wrong we were."
Lockhart concludes the Vikings could do the world and the league a lot of good by signing Kaepernick.
He's right. Signing Kaepernick would signal that the Vikings care about social justice, and that the NFL acknowledges its wrongful blackballing of a talented player.
Signing Kaepernick would also make football sense.
He is 32, healthy and remains in remarkable shape. The Vikings' current backup is Sean Mannion, the kind of extra quarterback that nobody wants to see take the field.
Kaepernick would give the Vikings a chance to win if Kirk Cousins gets injured, and he's young enough that he might become the franchise's quarterback of the future.
The best aspect of signing Kaepernick would be that he could become a familiar presence in Minnesota and in national media.
Plenty of Minnesota sports figures have taken the same stance as Kaeper-nick. Lynx players wore shirts emblazoned with "Black Lives Matter" after the killing of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling.
Gophers women's basketball coach Lindsay Whalen is a vocal supporter of social justice and stood with her black Lynx teammates at that time. Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve champions equality for all.
Former Twins star Torii Hunter spoke last week about being profiled, and former NBA player Stephen Jackson spoke eloquently in Minneapolis on Friday about racism and police killing unarmed black men.
Timberwolves players have tried to raise awareness about racism and have openly mourned Floyd's killing. Wolves GM Gersson Rosas and coach Ryan Saunders have spoken in support of their black players.
None of these Minnesota sports figures have been treated locally the way Kaepernick was treated nationally, because we know them, and we listen to them. We know they are good people. Even racists have trouble getting mad at Maya Moore or Karl-Anthony Towns.
They have not been reduced to symbols and talking points. In Minnesota, Kaepernick could become a powerful and familiar force for good. He might win a few football games, too.

More Minnesotans than outside agitators arrested

Full text: For two days, state and local officials blamed "outside agitators" for the spasm of violence and property damage that erupted when a black man, George Floyd, died after being restrained by a white Minneapolis police officer.
But organizers of Sunday's march on Interstate 35W say the focus on property damage and the alleged involvement of extremist groups is misplaced and is only shifting attention from the tragedy that has inspired thousands to gather peacefully every day for the past week.
"The problem is not some broken windows and some burned buildings, though we do recognize the pain our communities are in," Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said Sunday during a protest at the Capitol. "What is the problem is the fact that cops can kill with impunity."
Gov. Tim Walz continued to suggest Sunday that "it can't be Minnesotans" who would loot and burn homegrown businesses.
Residents took to social media to say they, too, had seen evidence of the involvement of outsiders such as white supremacist groups. President Donald Trump chimed in, alleging in tweets Saturday that the violence was "being led by Antifa and other radical groups." Antifa, short for anti-fascists, is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.
But the evidence of outside involvement is thin.
In St. Paul, police received numerous reports of suspicious vehicles without license plates parked and driving around the city, according to department spokesman Steve Linders. Officers also spotted some of those vehicles.
They investigated an abandoned pickup truck loaded with construction equipment. Callers reported that people had gone to and from the truck, taking items from it.
"Our officers were also encountering vehicles with no plates driving in our city," Linders said. "When officers attempted to stop the vehicles, they fled. We did not pursue them. Safety is a big concern in these situations."
Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said Sunday that authorities also spotted cars without license plates, their lights off and windows blacked out. When stopped, some of the occupants fled. Others were arrested.
Some cars, including some stolen in Minnesota, were filled with rocks and weapons, Harrington said. Authorities also discovered caches of incendiaries near the sites of fires that may have been transported in some of the stolen vehicles, he said.
"A this point, I don't have any credible evidence of any specific group being here in Minnesota," he said.
Harrington noted that authorities arrested at least 100 people late Saturday and early Sunday, far more than the previous two nights. "We used the curfew effectively," he said.
But data from Hennepin County showed more Minnesotans were arrested in protest areas of Minneapolis than people from out of state.
Of those booked, 47 were from Minnesota and 10 listed addresses from out of state, according to data for jail bookings likely associated with the protests. And of the Minnesotans arrested, 21 were from Minneapolis and St. Paul while 26 came from outside the two cities.
The arrests after curfew included five Minnesotans who were booked on weapons charges along with two others -- one from Nebraska and another from Illinois.
The Hennepin County jail bookings also showed that 13 Minnesotans and two people from out of state were arrested before Saturday's curfew when a massive law enforcement force, which was beefed up by thousands of National Guard soldiers, swept across the city to push curfew violators off the street and stymie violence.
It appears more Minnesotans than out-of-area protesters also were arrested on Friday -- a night of mayhem when businesses, cars and dumpsters were set on fire. Of those booked in Hennepin County after the 8 p.m. curfew, 17 were Minnesotans and two appeared to have come from outside the state. Earlier in the day, 12 Minnesotans were arrested compared with five with out-of-state addresses.
Saturday arrest data was not available from Ramsey County on Sunday.
Asked Sunday about the role of outsiders in the havoc, Walz emphasized the highly organized nature of the groups involved in the destruction, including what he called a cyber "denial of service" attack on state computer systems. "That's not somebody sitting in their basement," he said.
He said more data is needed to determine the extent of outside forces, but Walz acknowledged that Minnesota is responsible for setting off protests here and across the country.
"The catalyst that started all of this was the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota," Walz said. "And that was our problem."
Derek Chauvin, the now former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck as he begged for air on Memorial Day, has been charged with third-degree murder. But the move didn't quell protests. Instead, they grew throughout the week and turned more violent with protesters demanding the other three officers involved in the incident be arrested. All four officers were fired from the department.
"If those four cops had been arrested, as any members of the community caught on film murdering someone would have been, none of what has happened over the last four or five days would have happened," Gross said. "The fact that police officers get a free pass over and over and over and over again is what has driven us to this point.

Unfairness doesn't have to be: Wolves' Okogie mourning a reality that hits blacks too often

Author: Hine, Chris

Full text: Josh Okogie can't help but replay the situation in his mind and analyze all the ways in which George Floyd could still be alive.
The 21-year-old Timberwolves guard also can't shake the way police treated Floyd compared to the way police treated Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who was sentenced to death for murdering nine black people in a South Carolina church in 2015.
"He goes into a Baptist church and mass murders all these people. The cops come. They put a bulletproof vest on him, nobody harms him. Feed him Burger King," Okogie said. "So a guy who did a crime harsh enough to get the death sentence, you give him a bulletproof vest and you feed him Burger King?
"And you got a guy like George Floyd … he has four cops on him. One guy has his knee to his neck and he's crying for help."
It underscored Okogie's main message he wants people to know: "We're never safe. We never have a fair playing field."
Professional sports can sometimes try to stifle the views of its players in the name of not wanting to cause the dreaded D word -- distraction.
But in recent years, the NBA has been a place where players can express themselves, especially as it pertains to issues of race that affect them every day, and Okogie and teammates haven't been shy about sharing their thoughts and emotions on social media.
Okogie, who lives downtown, was on hand as former NBA player Stephen Jackson spoke at a rally Friday in honor of Floyd. Okogie said he could see why some people lashed out in anger over the course of the last week.
"I hear our cries and it's just hard because as I don't condone violence, at the same time, you can't push people to the wall and expect them not to fight back," Okogie said. "I think that's just a display of what we're seeing right now."
Joining Okogie at the rally was Wolves teammate Karl-Anthony Towns, who showed up even as he deals with his own personal grief in the wake of his mother Jacqueline's death to COVID-19.
"He's obviously in a tough situation right now, dealing with a lot of stuff, and to show up to something like this shows you he's about more than just himself," Okogie said.
Added coach Ryan Saunders: "Karl has endured a lot -- a lot. For him to speak up and stand up and be a leader while he's grieving in his own way, it just tells you a lot about his character, who he is as a person. … Karl's strength is something we can all take something from."
Through virtual chats, the Wolves have encouraged dialogue among their players and staff. President Gersson Rosas set up a talk between the team and Tru Pettigrew, a public speaker who helps connect communities with police.
Saunders said it was his responsibility during this time to "be more of a listener."
"I want to learn more and learn how I can stand and be an ally with all these individuals because enough is enough," Saunders said. "Stand with our brothers and sisters who may not look like us, stand with our brothers and sisters as human beings. Understanding that what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong and treating somebody different because of the way they look that should not be the judgment on that person. It's wrong.
"It's very sad that it's come to this and this is where conversations have had to start now."
Saunders said he had a conversation this week with a friend of his who is black and the friend gave Saunders a slice of what it's like to be black in America. The friend told Saunders he feels he has to dress a certain way when he walks out of his job or residence or else he is putting himself at a greater risk of harassment.
"He feels he needs to present himself a certain way, which to me is so unbelievably sad that some people may feel that way at times," Saunders said. "It's just crushing. So, it just crushes me."
The Wolves have been sharing those emotions as events unfold. Saunders said it "hurts" to see the destruction taking place in the state in which he grew up.
"I've felt compelled to speak out and not be silent because George Floyd should still be alive," Saunders said. "People in Minnesota are rightfully livid. They're speaking out and hey, if our family and friends who are in the minority weren't murdered, there wouldn't be riots. So you wish that was not occurring. But everybody deals with things in different ways."
Okogie said Floyd's death was another example of just how "vulnerable" black people are -- regardless of whether they're in the NBA or not.
"It doesn't matter where you are or what you do, you can always be a victim of racism," Okogie said.
