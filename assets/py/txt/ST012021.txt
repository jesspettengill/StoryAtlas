Full text: Prosecutors in the George Floyd case urged the Minnesota Court of Appeals to stop a scheduled March trial for one of the ex-Minneapolis police officers charged in the case because it could become a COVID-19 superspreader event.
Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is leading the prosecution, filed a 59-page brief Friday detailing why Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill was wrong to split the trials of four former Minneapolis officers into two, with one starting in March and a second in August.
"This appeal involves a question of exceptional and unique importance in one of the highest-profile cases in our Nation's history," wrote Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank and Special Attorney for the State Neal Katyal. " … This is a matter, quite literally, of life and death."
Prosecutors argued that their proposal to hold one trial in the summer when more people would be vaccinated against COVID-19 was the only safe option, and that a trial in March could have "potentially catastrophic consequences for public health." The trial will involve an unusually large number of witnesses and participants, as well as draw potentially thousands of demonstrators to the courthouse, exacerbating the danger, they added.
Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is scheduled to be tried on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on March 8 starting with jury selection. Opening statements are expected to begin March 29, with about a month of testimony and evidence about Floyd's May 25 death to follow.
His former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried in one trial starting Aug. 23. They are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All four have posted bond.
"The District Court disregarded the overwhelming evidence demonstrating that a trial for any of the Defendants on March 8 would be 'extremely dangerous,' and that it is 'extremely likely that one or more' trial participants -- lawyers, witnesses, jurors, or court staff -- would contract the coronavirus during a trial held in March 2021," the brief said.
Prosecutors had filed motions in December and mid-January asking for one trial in the summer due to COVID-19 risks. Cahill rejected the proposition both times, noting that the county's largest courtroom could not accommodate all four defendants at once because of COVID safety protocols.
Ellison's office is asking the Court of Appeals to reverse Cahill's rulings and compel him to hold one trial in the summer based on recommendations from nationally renowned health experts, doctors Ezekiel Emanuel and Michael Osterholm, provided by prosecutors.
"The undisputed evidence showed that a trial in the case in March 2021 could be a superspreader event, and could place a significant burden on the health care system at a time when cases are likely to be on the rise based on the likely prevalence of a new, more transmissible variant of the coronavirus …," the brief said.
Prosecutors filed a motion last year to join all four defendants' trials into one to spare witnesses and Floyd's family undue stress, among other reasons. Cahill had granted the request last November, then laid out the new trial plan in January after Hennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette asked him to split the trials in order to accommodate COVID safety measures.
Prosecutors took issue with Cahill rescinding his initial plan and creating a new one without briefing attorneys or hearing arguments on the matter. They accused the judge of violating the law, abusing his power and ignoring procedures in the Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure that govern when a trial should be divided.
"Instead of analyzing the factors required by [the Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure], the District Court relied on an e-mail from Chief Judge Barnette," prosecutors wrote. " … No provision of law allows the trial court to disregard" the rule.
Cahill had cited the very rule in his November decision to support holding one trial despite pleas from all four defense teams for separate trials, prosecutors noted.
Mitchell Hamline School of Law emeritus professor Joseph Daly reviewed the prosecution's brief and found it "quite convincing."
"My prediction is that the appellate court is going to step in very quickly and stop this trial on March 8," he said. "I think this is a very convincing, strongly worded brief."
The Court of Appeals must review all matters brought before it and has up to 90 days to issue a decision.
Prosecutors requested a hearing so they could argue their case orally but also asked the Court of Appeals to entertain the option of skipping a hearing and immediately issuing a "writ of prohibition" to stop the March trial.
Daly said if the court were to immediately stop the trial, it could later hold a hearing to determine whether the four defendants should be tried together or separately.
If the court does not rule in the attorney general's favor, prosecutors could petition the Minnesota Supreme Court to address the matter. A review by the Supreme Court is not guaranteed.
"This is maybe the most important trial that's ever taken place in the state of Minnesota," Daly said. "It has caused a worldwide response, a social response. It has forced people to really look at the authority and power that we give police worldwide."

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 1/30/21: This story should have said that the Attorney General's Office accused Judge Peter Cahill of abusing his "discretion." Prosecutors in the George Floyd case took the unusual step Thursday of asking the Minnesota Court of Appeals to intervene after a lower court twice refused their request to hold one trial in the summer for all four ex-Minneapolis police officers charged in the case.
The strongly worded request from Attorney General Keith Ellison's office accused Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill of violating state law and abusing his power when he ordered that one trial would start in March and a second would start five months later.
Ellison's office, which is leading the prosecution, had argued for one trial in the summertime when more people would be vaccinated against COVID-19.
"The District Court's decision … to proceed with two trials creates a serious public health risk," Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank wrote in his request to the Court of Appeals. " … District Court's decision violates the law and threatens serious harms to public health."
Frank wrote that Cahill's decisions were "a clear abuse of power." Cahill presides over both trials.
Ellison's office is asking the Court of Appeals to reverse Cahill's decision and compel him to hold one trial in the summer. Prosecutors filed a short appeal and have additional time to file a more in-depth brief arguing their case.
Prosecutors first filed a motion in late December requesting one trial starting June 7 because of risks posed by COVID-19.
Cahill ruled Jan. 11 that the fired officers charged in Floyd's May 25 death would be tried in two separate trials because the county's largest courtroom could not accommodate them all due to COVID safety protocols.
Ellison's office filed a motion Jan. 19 asking Cahill to reconsider his ruling, and again asked for a summer trial but did not specify a start date. Cahill rejected that motion two days later with a one-sentence denial and no further justification for his reasoning.
A local legal scholar and former county attorney said the prosecution's latest move made sense in light of the pandemic, which has been complicated by a new COVID-19 variant discovered in the state and a limited vaccine rollout.
"They have understandable concerns," said former Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner.
However, Gaertner and Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, noted that the Court of Appeals typically does not get involved with cases before trial. The higher court is designed to review issues after a defendant has been convicted and alleges that a facet of the trial process led to their wrongful conviction.
Daly called the prosecution's request "fairly unusual."
"The trial judge is supposed to be making the procedural decisions," Daly said. "The Court of Appeals doesn't like slowing down a trial … before a trial has even taken place."
The Court of Appeals is required to review all matters brought before it and has up to 90 days to issue a decision. Daly predicted a much faster response given the trial date.
"A pandemic event is not normal, and could affect how the Court of Appeals looks at this pretrial appeal," Gaertner said.
Frank wrote in his appeal that Cahill's rulings also conflicted with a Jan. 21 order from Minnesota State Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea governing statewide court activities due to COVID-19.
Gildea ordered that effective Feb. 1, jury trials in progress will continue, but that no new jury trials will begin before March 15. She allowed each district's chief judge to grant exceptions. Defendants in jail charged with certain crimes who had made speedy trial demands were also exempt from the delay.
While Gildea's order and new guidelines issued this week by Hennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette would likely severely limit the number of trials in March, some trials ostensibly could be held that month.
When prosecutors argued at a Jan. 7 hearing for a summer trial date, Cahill countered by noting that moving their trial would simply lead to other defendants filling the hole instead.
"Someone is going to be subject to that risk," Cahill said at the time. "It's a question of who has to take the risk."
Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is scheduled to be tried on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on March 8 starting with jury selection. Opening statements are expected to begin on March 29, with about a month of testimony and evidence to follow.
His former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are scheduled to be tried in one trial starting Aug. 23. They are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All four have posted bond.
Daly and Gaertner questioned Frank's language in describing Cahill's decisions.
"I thought, 'These words are pretty strong,' " Daly said. "I did not think it was par for the course."
Daly said he would have rephrased the argument and avoided accusing the judge of violating the law.
"I'm not sure that language is helpful in seeking the court's review," Gaertner said. "But this is a hard case and these are hard times.
"Judge Cahill is a professional. He will preside with honor and integrity."

Walz, GOP clash over state aid to repair damage after George Floyd riots

Full text: Minnesota leaders are debating the state's financial responsibility for helping Minneapolis and St. Paul pay for property damage and other costs related to last summer's civil unrest.
Gov. Tim Walz rolled out a budget this week that would borrow $150 million to rebuild damaged businesses and private property in the Twin Cities, and proposed a new fund to aid local governments with law enforcement costs during unrest and other emergencies.
Meanwhile, legislators are clashing over Walz's decision last year to use state disaster funding to help the Twin Cities rebuild from the damage caused by riots in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing by police. A new Senate proposal would block communities from getting reimbursed through an existing disaster account for civil unrest damages.
"I've heard over and over again from greater Minnesota, from my constituents: 'Please do not pay for this out of our taxpayer dollars,' " said proposal sponsor Sen. Julie Rosen, R-Fairmont.
Clashes over the aid will likely be a common theme throughout this legislative session. And the debate and demands for local support could flare anew if protests arise around the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death and scheduled to go to trial March 8.
Walz's budget includes at least $4.2 million for anticipated state law enforcement expenses to handle violence and demonstrations around the trial. Several million more would be devoted to responding to threats around the presidential inauguration and ongoing risks to the Capitol. Last year, Minnesota's public safety spending was $24 million more than it typically would have been because of civil unrest-related costs, a Management and Budget department spokesman said.
The DFL governor's budget would also create a $35 million fund, dubbed the SAFE account, to reimburse local governments that call in surrounding communities' law enforcement agencies to help, as Minneapolis did during the rioting after Floyd's death.
"We saw an unprecedented amount of civil unrest; some of that turned into civil disobedience and crime, in arsons and other things," Walz said as he unveiled the budget. He said he is making the case to the Legislature that Minnesotans should work together to help out the Twin Cities, and he stressed the importance of using the state's disaster account to "help rebuild those corridors, to make sure that we understand that that benefits all Minnesotans."
The Federal Emergency Management Agency rejected Walz's request in July for disaster assistance to help with $15.6 million of fire damage to public buildings and equipment in the Twin Cities. The Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct station, a community clinic, Hennepin County Library and streetlights were among the public properties burned or otherwise damaged. In November, Walz announced he would use the state disaster account to reimburse local governments for the bulk of that cost, about $12 million.
The state created the fund in 2014 so it could quickly refund cities and counties after disasters, instead of requiring the Legislature to hold a special session to sign off on the money. But Rosen contended this week that the account was meant for natural disasters such as floods or tornadoes. She proposed changing the law to explicitly say that civil unrest does not qualify for the aid, and would make that change retroactive to Jan. 1, 2020.
Rosen said assistance for Minneapolis and Hennepin County is a "good discussion," but instead of using the disaster fund, she suggested legislators try to pass a bill to provide the $12 million. However, such a measure could prove challenging to pass in a divided Legislature.
"I want to make sure that the taxpayers of Minnesota are not paying for something that perhaps, by the actions of our executive branch and the mayor of Minneapolis, perhaps were [exacerbated]," Rosen said during a hearing. She was hitting on a theme the Senate's Republican majority has zeroed in on after the riots: that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey should have given law enforcement more latitude to stop rioting and Walz should have brought in the National Guard sooner.
Walz and Frey have defended their decisions, saying they did the best they could to respond to a complex and fast-changing situation.
Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, countered Rosen's comments by reading off a long list of examples of people from outside the Twin Cities and state who were involved in creating the damage, such as a Brainerd-area man who was charged with helping burn the Third Precinct station and a member of the Boogaloo Bois from Texas who was charged with opening fire on the precinct and helping burn the building.
"It's awfully hard for the folks from greater Minnesota to say, 'It was all Minneapolis's fault, it was all Minneapolis political leadership's fault and the governor's political leadership errors,' " Latz said, adding that lawmakers should instead be focused on helping Minnesotans who end up suffering from the damage.
Emergency management directors and local government associations have warned state leaders against narrowing the scope of the disaster fund to exclude civil unrest, saying it could create future complications when the state applies for federal aid.
It is not clear how Rosen's proposal would fare in the Democratic-led House, where Twin Cities DFLers hold considerable sway. A House hearing on a different bill related to the disaster fund prompted a similar clash Wednesday over whether civil unrest reimbursements are a fair use of dollars.
However, the $12 million from the disaster account would cover just a fraction of the overall damage costs and is limited to certain public infrastructure.
Minneapolis estimated the summer riots caused more than $350 million in damage across the city, and St. Paul identified $82 million in damage.
While private insurers covered many of the businesses' expenses, the Lake Street Council has estimated that along that Minneapolis corridor alone, small-business owners have suffered at least $200 million in uninsured losses.
Walz wants to use $150 million in redevelopment appropriations bonds to help small businesses and other private-property owners rebuild. Meanwhile, the Democratic-led House is pushing a proposal called the PROMISE Act that would use about $300 million from the state's general fund for redevelopment and relief programs for those hurt by the unrest. The Legislature did not pass that DFL effort during an initial attempt last summer.

Review touts bodycams for U police: University tapped an outside expert to review campus police last fall.

Full text: To improve trust with students, the University of Minnesota's police force should wear body cameras and no longer have access to military-grade weapons, an external review has concluded.
The university on Tuesday shared the findings of the outside review of its campus Police Department, which was ordered last fall after student demands for law enforcement accountability following George Floyd's death. Among dozens of recommendations, the report suggests the U should consider an "unarmed policing approach," better distinguish when its officers should assist local agencies with off-campus incidents, and review its department's stops, arrests and complaints for possible disparities.
"This review is an important next step in learning more about what it means for all members of our campus community to feel respected, included and safe," U President Joan Gabel said in a statement.
Gabel committed to immediately act on four recommendations: Equipping campus officers with body cameras, meeting regularly with the Minneapolis and St. Paul mayors to coordinate public safety response, purchasing a campus safety app for students and employees, and transferring oversight of the department to the university's senior vice president of finance and operations, Myron Frans.
An advisory group of students, staff and faculty will analyze the recommendations and come up with a final plan, Gabel said. University police were not made available for comment.
The review was conducted by Cedric Alexander, a former police chief and member of President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Through Jan. 20, the U paid Alexander $125,000 for five months of consulting, according to his contract.
Alexander held more than 70 listening sessions with students, employees, administrators and campus police officers. Many students and employees told Alexander they feared being harmed by campus cops, according to the report. Students of color recalled being racially profiled, and student leaders and activists pointed to recent peaceful protests where officers showed up with batons and shields.
But some students expressed support for campus officers and raised concerns about crime near campus, saying they felt unsafe walking at night. Officers told Alexander they felt unappreciated by the campus community, noting "there has been a real shift since the George Floyd incident."
Alexander recommended the university "demilitarize" its Police Department by eliminating the use of military-grade weapons and vehicles. The U should also consider redesigning officers' uniforms to better distinguish them from other agencies, the report says.
He suggested more ways to encourage feedback on the department, including forums and having officers provide their contact information.
Campus community members should have a say in the selection process for new hires, the report says. And new officers should be required to intern with student groups as part of onboarding.
U regents will hear the findings in February.
"It seems very comprehensive and wide-ranging," U senior and Board of Regents candidate James Farnsworth said of the report. "I think that all UMPD officers should absolutely be equipped with bodycams."

Full text: A Hennepin County judge ruled Tuesday that several incidents in which former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin used a neck or head restraint on a civilian cannot be introduced as evidence when he is tried for kneeling on George Floyd's neck, nor can Floyd's prior arrest and conviction.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill ruled Tuesday that prosecutors could use two other examples when Chauvin is tried on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges for Floyd's death last May 25. He also denied defense attorneys' request to introduce Floyd's 2019 arrest during a traffic stop by Minneapolis police and an aggravated robbery conviction from Texas.
A monthlong feud between prosecutors and defense attorneys continued to grow Tuesday when Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, filed an affidavit reasserting claims that prosecutors mishandled how they shared evidence with defense attorneys. Nelson wrote that Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank acknowledged last week he had more evidence that hadn't been shared with defense attorneys.
"I spoke to Assistant Attorney General Matt Frank and expressed my absolute anger and frustration with the manner in which the State has conducted discovery and made its discovery in this matter," Nelson wrote.
The Attorney General's Office did not return a message seeking comment.
The developments come as prosecutors and Nelson prepare to go to trial March 8 in Chauvin's case despite failed pleas from both sides to push back the start date.
Chauvin's former co-workers -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- will be tried in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Cahill issued several rulings on prosecution and defense motions, giving greater definition to both trials.
The judge ordered that prosecutors could introduce evidence about two cases from Chauvin's past:
• In 2015, Chauvin and other officers responded to a suicidal and intoxicated male. Other officers used a stun gun on the male and placed him in a "side-recovery position." Medical professionals later told the officers that if they had restrained him longer or delayed transporting him to a hospital he could have died.
• In 2017, Chauvin placed his knee on a female's neck while she lay on the ground. Prosecutors wrote in a court filing that Chauvin kept his knee on her neck "beyond the point when such force was needed."
Floyd was lying stomach-down in the street when Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes as Kueng and Lane knelt on his back and legs as he pleaded for breath. Thao kept an angry crowd at bay.
Cahill ruled that prosecutors could not introduce evidence about six incidents, among them: In 2017, Chauvin used a neck restraint on a juvenile, flipped him onto his stomach and pinned him to the floor; and in 2019, Chauvin used a neck restraint on an intoxicated male until he became unconscious.
Prosecutors argued in a previous filing that including all eight incidents would show Chauvin had "a propensity, or a modus operandi, regarding the way in which he approached arrestees."
Cahill denied each defense team's request to introduce evidence about Floyd's 2019 arrest and Texas conviction. Defense attorneys had argued that Floyd swallowed pills in the 2019 encounter and was taken to a hospital, and that the incident is relevant because he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system when he died.
Defense attorneys have argued that Floyd died of a drug overdose and outstanding health issues.
Cahill denied the prosecution's request to admit evidence about nine incidents involving Thao. According to the evidence, he sat in his squad while other officers handled a call and attempted to manipulate a domestic abuse victim in 2012 so he wouldn't have to file a police report.
Prosecutors are also prohibited from presenting evidence about a 2019 arrest involving Kueng and other officers pinning a person to the ground.
Nelson on Tuesday continued to allege that prosecutors mishandled discovery, the process of sharing evidence with defense attorneys, despite Cahill stating in a mid-January ruling that he believed prosecutors were acting in good faith.
All four defense teams have accused prosecutors of sandwiching key evidence in between irrelevant materials, providing duplicates and missing deadlines, among other claims.
Nelson obtained copies of the same evidence as they were first created by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which investigated the case. The BCA kept the evidence in a "well organized, labeled and easily identifiable" manner, Nelson wrote, but prosecutors converted some of the same evidence into a single, 6,032-page PDF file that was not searchable.
Prosecutors previously defended their method, saying they shared evidence as they received it.
Nelson said his review of BCA files revealed that some evidence given to prosecutors, including a Minneapolis police PowerPoint presentation on neck restraints, hadn't been shared with defense attorneys.
According to Nelson's filing, Frank called him last Friday and said he became aware of a flash drive with more evidence, including police training materials and personnel records. Frank also said a video on "positional asphyxia" that had been allegedly shown to all Minneapolis officers was among evidence his office hadn't shared with defense attorneys.
Prosecutors hand-delivered the new evidence to Nelson at his home last Friday.

First Floyd protest suit settled: Mpls. faces more claims alleging police misconduct at summer demonstrations.

Full text: The city of Minneapolis has settled the first lawsuit by a demonstrator injured by a police projectile in the aftermath of George Floyd's death.
The City Council has approved a payment of $57,900 to Graciela Cisneros and her attorneys. Mayor Jacob Frey officially signed off on the payout last Tuesday.
Cisneros, 22, suffered an eye injury when a police officer fired a projectile at her on May 29 as she and her partner were walking home after a demonstration.
"Right now it is looking like she recovered," said Nico Ratkowski, her St. Paul attorney. "The settlement made sense based on what my client and what the city were willing to do," he said.
The city was confronted with large demonstrations and major civil unrest after the death of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25. Four police officers have been charged with killing Floyd.
The Cisneros suit is one of several legal actions alleging police misconduct during the Floyd protests, including a second federal suit filed by Ratkowski on behalf of Ericka Khounedaleth, 21, an accounting administrator from Plymouth. She was yanked from her car at gunpoint by a Minneapolis police officer who pushed her to the pavement on May 31, the suit alleges.
The incident was captured by New York-based photojournalist Victor J. Blue, whose photo was published in the New York Times.
"I still experience a lot of night terrors," Khounedaleth said in an interview. "I have frequent nightmares. I have very bad dreams."
Cisneros, who declined to be interviewed, was an Augsburg University student living in Eagan. She was walking with her partner, Ricardo Ramos Jr., after attending a May 29 march to protest the Floyd killing, when they encountered three officers at S. 1st Avenue near E. 28th Street in Minneapolis. One of the officers shined a flashlight at them and another fired his weapon, launching a nonlethal projectile at her face, the suit said. None of the officers offered to help her, the suit says.
She was not arrested. People in a nearby apartment let the two stay overnight and in the morning she was taken to Regions Hospital in St. Paul where she received four stitches and a CT scan showing she had suffered a fracture of her left cheekbone.
Ratkowski said there was green paint on Cisneros' face, indicating she was likely shot with a "marking round" used in crowd control. He said he was unable to obtain body camera footage nor could he determine the name of the officer who fired the round.
In his second suit against the city, which is still in its early stages, Ratkowski said that Khounedaleth was driving a car with four passengers with the intention of passing out water bottles to protesters. They were following a group of protesters marching on Washington Avenue when police cordoned off the area and she pulled into a parking lot to turn around.
Police pointed guns at her. "She was ripped out of the car without any warning," said Ratkowski. The car was in reverse when she was pulled out of the vehicle and a police officer had to jump in and put it in park. Khounedaleth was handcuffed with plastic ties and put on a Metro Mobility bus with other protesters. She was issued citations for unlawful assembly and a curfew violation and released early the next morning. The charges were later dropped according to the federal lawsuit. Three other occupants of the car also had their charges dropped, and Ratkowski said he did not have information on the fifth occupant.
Protesters and journalists have filed multiple lawsuits for injuries suffered during the protests. Officials acknowledged last summer that some innocent civilians were injured during days of protests and unrest but they argued the situation required force to maintain public safety and it was difficult to distinguish between peaceful protesters and those wishing to cause harm.
In two lawsuits, attorney Robert Bennett represents Ethan Marks, 19, a bystander, who lost vision in his right eye when he was struck in the face with a tear-gas canister last May, and Soren Stevenson, 25, a protester who lost his left eye when he was struck by a projectile fired by police in a separate demonstration over Floyd's death.
Dave Bicking, a board member of Communities United Against Police Brutality, a local activist group, has long opposed the use of nonlethal projectiles.
"The city should ban the use of these less-lethal munitions or projectiles, or at the very least ban them for crowd control because they are used indiscriminately and cause serious injuries," Bicking said.
The Minneapolis city attorney's office would not discuss the Cisneros settlement.
"At this time, the City Attorney's Office is declining to comment on this case or any of the cases stemming from the unrest following George Floyd's death," said Casper Hill, media relations coordinator for the city of Minneapolis.

Lift up the voices of Black women

Full text: On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I sat with my three daughters and watched the "King in the Wilderness" documentary, a remarkable film about the final, turbulent months that preceded King's assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
"Mrs. King, are you taking part in this demonstration as an individual or as a wife?" a white reporter asks Coretta Scott King, about her participation in a rally against the Vietnam War in one scene.
Taken aback, she offers this response: "Well, I'm taking part as an individual and a wife. I'm both."
In the future, Hollywood will commit big dollars to major productions about George Floyd's life and the worldwide movement that followed. As I sat there with my girls, I wondered how those movies and documentaries -- a key educational tool for the next generation -- might portray the Black women who've lent their time, resources, voices and bodies in the name of social justice and the eradication of systemic racism.
Last week, I asked that question of Lena K. Gardner -- a Black woman who identifies as queer and a central leader of the Black Lives Matter movement in Minneapolis.
Gardner pointed to the many layered depictions of Black men -- heterosexual Black men -- as forward-facing figures in the push for civil rights throughout history, a nuance unafforded to Black women who have not been allowed "their full humanity."
She also mentioned the women missing from some of the most prominent stories from the civil rights movement because they weren't provided the same privilege to leave their homes and jobs to participate. "I don't think anything significant is going to change," Gardner said about the future portrayal of Black women in the current movement for justice. "There is this whole fetishism and cult of the charismatic Black man. I don't think that will change."
I have been a dues-paying member of that cult. My perspective on Black history has been tainted by the sexism, misogyny and discrimination that's sidelined Black women in mainstream conversations about history's most important moments.
After I saw "Malcolm X," Spike Lee's blockbuster movie, in 1992, I bought two things: an Africa chain and Alex Haley's autobiography written with the icon who was assassinated in 1965. Malcolm X and his contemporaries were my heroes. I did not devote as much energy to learning more about the women around them.
I thought Rosa Parks was a woman who sat in the back of a bus because she was tired. I didn't understand her contributions as a longtime activist. I researched Huey P. Newton and the Black Panthers, but failed to realize that the women within the organization were instrumental in the group's outreach efforts, including free breakfast and shoes programs, that strengthened its bond with the community. And I believed the March on Washington in 1963, where King unveiled his "I Have a Dream" speech, was pure, unaware that Black women had been blocked from speaking roles.
Throughout the history of the movement for equality, Black women have been presented as Best Supporting Actresses, denied the recognition they've deserved, because men have largely been the storytellers and power brokers behind these portrayals.
Lissa Jones, host of KMOJ's "The Urban Agenda" and the Black Market Reads podcast, said the arrival of Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black, Asian and female vice president in the history of the country, will create a larger demand for accountability and curiosity.
"I think it will be incumbent upon Black women to shout out our narratives," she said. "This whole time, we've been doing this unrecognized."
Over the summer, Sirius Marie, a 21-year-old activist who moved to Minnesota for a better life a month before Floyd's death, joined friends at the 2020 March on Washington and recited her poetry in front of the statue of King. She chanted "Black Lives Matter!" through a megaphone as she marched through the streets with thousands last summer.
"I know I'm participating in history," she said.
I asked her if the conversation was simply generational. But she said she's witnessed the suppression of Black women's voices among younger activists, too. I asked all three Black women what they hope to see in the movies that will be produced about the past year in Minneapolis and beyond.
Gardner said she hopes Black queer women are represented, too. Marie said she wants to see images of the women she's witnessed with "boots on the ground."
"We are neither Aunt Jemima, nor Jezebel, nor any of the other tropes they've made up," Jones said. "We are complex and we deserve to be presented in our complexities."
A real movie about the movement for social justice should portray Lena K. Gardner as a powerful voice, complete with the complexities she's said Black women have been denied. It must show Lissa Jones, in her studio in Minneapolis, leading comprehensive conversations. And it also must feature a young activist like Sirius Marie, perhaps with her fist in the air at 38th and Chicago, where George Floyd was killed, an image on her Instagram feed.
If that happens, perhaps boys and girls will see more representation of Black women in books and films that address the current climate.
But I also must do my job to elevate those voices before I can expect that of anyone else, so I'd like to end with a line from Marie's poem called "Tell Us." It summarizes the fight Black people, especially Black women, continue to face.
Continuously you try your best to compress and yet
We rise STRONGER
Create beauty from the pain
Masterpieces from your scraps

Forged in community: Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center may be the least visible big arts organization in Minneapolis.

Author: ELER, ALICIA

Full text: Victoria Lauing is convinced that an invisibility cloak covers her organization, the Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center.
To those in the know, the center supports as many as 800 artists per year working with heat, flame and fire -- particularly those who are people of color, new to large-scale sculpture, or focusing on social justice or environmental issues.
"This organization being led by four moms is a big part of it," said artistic director Heather Doyle. "It's like: How can we help you learn and grow and achieve whatever you want?"
The center is located in an old movie house on Chicago Avenue near 38th Street, where George Floyd was killed. On Monday -- Martin Luther King Jr. Day -- volunteers raised a steel version of the giant plywood fist that was erected at the intersection last summer.
A crew of eight built the work, originally created by Jordan Powell Karis, at Chicago Fire Arts over the course of just five days.
The organization does not take credit for the sculpture. It only wanted to be of service.
"The fist is an icon of Black power and that is what its significance is to the
community here at George Floyd Square," said Lauing, who is the center's executive director. "Our role in its re-creation was about ceding power.
"That is why this isn't a project of the CAFAC. It was a project of the community. We had resources to offer, so we did."
Bringing equity to public art
Lauing, Doyle, gallery coordinator Jhyle Rinker and volunteer coordinator Jessica Bergman Tank make up the fiery core of Chicago Fire Arts.
The center has about 135 pieces of equipment to support blacksmithing, welding, mold-making and foundry work, and neon-bending.
Built in 1915 as the Nokomis Theater, a silent cinema, and transformed into an auto body shop in 1952, the 5,000-square-foot center was founded in 2007 by a group of six neighbors who met each other through work with the Central and Bryant neighborhood organizations.
There are still traces of the building's former owners, including a projection room, a big proscenium arch and the cinema's original tiles, which were covered with industrial linoleum during the auto-shop days.
In the front, the Nokomis Gallery offers artists a place to sell their work. It is currently closed because of the pandemic, but the RedHot Gift Shop is open online at cafac.org/redhot.
A key goal of the center is to increase equity in the field of public art.
"Public art is a vision of the community," said Doyle. "If it doesn't reflect the people that are part of that community, then that's an issue."
Christopher Harrison, a visual artist and Chicago Fire Arts board member, feels strongly about the long-term significance of public art.
"I think art is stronger when it's available to everyone," he said. "When it's there in your neighborhood, in your environment, it becomes a part of you, like you become of it."
Last week, artist Angela Two Stars came to Chicago Fire Arts to work on a public art project aimed at Energy Park Drive in St. Paul, where the St. Paul Port Authority has a water filtration system.
Mentored by veteran St. Paul artist Seitu Jones, Two Stars is thinking about what's under the surface of our bodies. We all have bones and blood beneath our different colored skins.
She needed panels that would withstand winter and hold up to graffiti, so the staff at Chicago Fire Arts trained her in crafting enameled steel.
"It's like: I have this idea, how do I make it real?" said Two Stars, who wound up experimenting with melted glass mixed with minerals.
"To get advice, support from Chicago Fire Arts and really get steered toward enamel was a selling point for me. Now I can have a hand in the work rather than just sending it to a fabricator."
At its core, the organization wants to remain accessible to any interested artist. It offers generous scholarships and liability insurance to people who participate in their programs.
Earned income makes up 75% of the organization's budget, augmented by grants from the Minnesota State Arts Board and Metropolitan Regional Arts Council. McKnight Foundation is also a longtime funder.
Last July, during the continued protests and unrest, the center started offering workshops for the community. It made plasticine impressions of mementos brought in by people -- ranging from a Red Bull cap used by protectors of the square to a bullet casing found in a speed bump -- and then cast them in bronze.
The idea came from listening to community members. The real magic happened when heat entered the picture.
"There's something really healing about pouring metal," said Tank. "It's a really physical, very intense art form. There's heat, there's trust, there's community.
"You cannot pour 70 pounds of bronze without a team. Without a community coming together."

Frey says he'll seek re-election: He faces early opposition from activist Sheila Nezhad.

Full text: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Thursday announced plans to run for re-election after a tumultuous year that tested his leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, George Floyd's death and riots that devastated parts of the city.
"We stepped up through a very difficult time," Frey said, defending his handling of multiple crises. "Was it a tough year in our city and nationally? Absolutely, it was. What we showed very consistently is the kind of steady, determined and collaborative leadership that you need."
Still, some wanted to see more from the mayor. Local activist Sheila Nezhad, who favors defunding police, said she will run against him, and faults the mayor for failing to meet people's needs after Floyd's death.
Minneapolis is in a far different position than it was in 2017, when Frey, then a City Council member, ousted the incumbent mayor, Betsy Hodges.
Early in his term, Frey benefited from the city's strong economy and the positive national attention of the Super Bowl, which was played in 2018 at U.S. Bank Stadium. But a series of crises followed. Last year, the coronavirus pandemic strained city resources, put thousands out of work and exacerbated the city's racial disparities.
While he received praise for his rapid condemnation of the officers who killed George Floyd, Frey faced widespread criticism for the city's response to the rioting that followed, including his decision to abandon the police Third Precinct rather than risk a bloody confrontation.
But challengers have been slow to emerge. Last time, Frey ran in a field of 16 candidates, including the incumbent mayor and a state representative. So far, four people have said they're running, but Nezhad is the only one who responded to Star Tribune inquiries Thursday.
Notably absent from the list are sitting City Council members who, earlier in the term, were eyed as potential competitors. A Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 poll conducted in August found that voters gave Frey a higher approval rating than the council but also said they trusted the City Council to make decisions about the Police Department more than Frey.
Council President Lisa Bender, whose supporters had once envisioned her as a potential Frey challenger, said late last year that she didn't have plans to run for re-election or for any office.
Overall, candidates for city offices appear to be "taking their time this year," said Devin Hogan, chair of the Minneapolis DFL. He attributed that to fatigue from the presidential election and the pandemic.
"I wouldn't be surprised if someone is going to run ... and doesn't declare until the summer," Hogan said. "I wouldn't say that's out of the question."
Candidates aren't required to file paperwork declaring their run until late summer.
Police and public safety issues are expected to be focal points of the campaigns.
Frey quickly became a target for activists who want the Police Department to be abolished or drastically reduced. Shortly after Floyd's death, protesters gathered outside the mayor's home, asked if he would abolish the department, and when he declined, shouted, "Shame, shame, shame!"
Nezhad worked as policy organizer for Reclaim the Block, a group that helped lead the push to cut police funding.
"Neighbors are building connections in ways never seen before and also demanding change to the way our government serves or does not serve people of color in this city," said Nezhad, a woman of color who identifies as queer. "He's not connected to what's happening on the ground and has failed to follow through with the promises he made when he ran for office."
Frey said he has raised funding for affordable housing projects, implemented policies to improve accountability in the Police Department and worked with groups focused on improving economic inclusion.
He has found allies in other activists, including some Black leaders on the North Side, who say they prefer a "both-and" approach to public safety that leaves police budgets largely intact while increasing funding for other violence prevention programs. His early endorsements come from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and former Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, among others.
"I told the truth and took tough positions that did not deviate, regardless of who I was talking to," Frey said. "It's that principled approach that you need, because the position of mayor is tough."

Full text: Citing "an extremely serious threat to public health," prosecutors in the case of four fired Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd have asked the judge to reconsider his decision to try Derek Chauvin in March and the other three officers five months later.
The motion filed Tuesday afternoon comes less than a week after Judge Peter Cahill's order splitting the trial into two. As of now, Chauvin will be tried in Hennepin County District Court starting March 8; J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao will be tried together starting Aug. 23.
The judge wrote then that COVID-19, social distancing protocol and uncertainty about the vaccine rollout prevented the four defendants from being tried in one trial.
In Tuesday's motion, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank cited the arrival of a new, more infectious strain of COVID-19 to Minnesota, and asked that the four be tried jointly this summer, when vaccines are more widely available.
"Although the State continues to stand ready to try this case on March 8, the State believes that the timing of this trial is enormously consequential for public health," the motion reads. "The difference between following the Court's current schedule -- one trial in March, and one in August -- and holding a single joint trial in the summer of 2021 may well be a matter of life and death for some Minnesotans."
The motion includes an affidavit by epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm wrote that he anticipates the COVID-19 vaccine to be available to the general population by late spring.
He anticipates there being 5,000 to 8,000 new cases in Minnesota per day of the new coronavirus strain by March, and warned that Chauvin's trial, if held then, could become a superspreader event.
"It could be extremely dangerous to hold a trial for Mr. Chauvin in March 2021. Doing so could have potentially catastrophic consequences for public health," Osterholm wrote. "This is so not simply because of the [relatively small] number of people who would be inside the courtroom, but also because of the large numbers of people likely to be convened outside the courthouse, including demonstrators."
Two trials rather than one in connection with Floyd's death on May 25, he added, would only exacerbate that risk.
Cahill's decision to try Chauvin separately came after the four defense attorneys consulted with Hennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette and expressed their intentions to each have a second attorney or a legal aide at their table during trial.
Barnette e-mailed Cahill last Friday urging him to split up the trial because of COVID concerns, noting that the courtroom could accommodate three defendants at most.
Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is leading the prosecution with assistance from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, maintained that all four defendants should be tried together to avoid retraumatizing witnesses and family members, and to limit prejudicing potential jurors between trials.
His office previously requested one trial, and filed a motion last month asking Cahill to delay proceedings until June 7, when more people would be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, and Thao's attorneys, Robert and Natalie Paule, also filed separate motions last month asking to delay the trial to an unspecified date and to July 5, respectively, in order to deal with copious evidence.

Call to action amid a legacy of hope

Full text: "When I say 'doctor' you say 'King'!" an activist shouted.
The crowd chanted the name as it marched up Lexington Parkway in St. Paul. Then, the activist continued, "When I say 'Black lives' you say 'matter!' "
Racial justice leaders evoked the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday as they linked his civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s to the modern movement for Black lives. On the first King holiday since the police killing of George Floyd ignited a global reckoning about racism and police brutality, organizers, politicians and business leaders reflected on the work left to be done almost 53 years after King was assassinated in Memphis.
"We cannot rest because as Dr. King said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,' " said Chris Majors, a director of food safety and quality at General Mills.
He chaired the 31st annual Dr. Martin Luther King Holiday Breakfast, an event organized by General Mills and the United Negro College Fund, held virtually this year under the theme "Our Rising Voices: A Call for Bold Social Action."
Among the speakers was Bernice King, who was 5 when her father, Martin Luther King Jr., was killed.
She said she hoped the pandemic would bring about what her father called for in his book "Where Do We Go From Here?" -- a revolution of values and a reordering of priorities toward people and away from materialism. Bernice King called for educating people to adopt a "nonviolent way of living."
"You don't attack people," she said. "You don't destroy people. You stay focused on the issue. ... At the end off the day, you're trying to find a win-win pathway and win people over instead of win over them."
"Now more than ever the legacy and message of Dr. King continues to offer us hope, encouragement and a bold vision of moving through these challenging times," said St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter. He urged the audience to join him in "harnessing the resilience and power of our beloved communities and in one voice continue our fight to ensure no one is left behind."
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., noted that King had said, "Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. ... Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle."
She added that the pandemic has disproportionately hurt communities of color and that the systemic racism in the justice system was "once again laid bare after the horrific murder of George Floyd. So now is a time for us to respond to systemic racism with systemic change and collectively raise our voices. It is time to heed Dr. King's words: 'The time is always right to do what is right.' "
At noon, a separately organized demonstration outside of Central High School in St. Paul took on a more urgent and at times angrier tone as activists and loved ones of people killed by Minnesota police called for justice. Marcus Golden. Cordale Handy. Philando Castile. George Floyd. The crowd chanted a string of police victims' names and blocked traffic as they marched and gathered in the streets, at one point dancing to N.W.A.'s 1988 anti-police song as groups of law enforcement officers wielding batons blocked off the nearby entrances to Interstate 94.
Officers stationed at points throughout the march kept a close eye on the group.
Mimi Baxter noticed the demonstration Monday afternoon and decided to join in, still upset about the gentler treatment of the largely white mob at the U.S. Capitol compared with Black Lives Matter protesters.
"Instead of sitting in my home and being terrified and depressed, I thought I would march in the spirit of my parents, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks ... you name it," she said.
Noting the historic violence inflicted by the Ku Klux Klan, Baxter said that racism is like cancer: "You beat it or you get it under control and, no, the same cancer comes back to kill you. Are you going to get up and fight or are you going to lay there and die?"
"The whole damn system is guilty as hell," activist Satara Strong-Allen told the crowd. "... The longer the police walk free, the longer we stay in captivity. Until Black people have liberation, there won't be liberation for anybody!"
They gathered outside the St. Paul Police Western District station.
Civil rights leader Nekima Levy Armstrong noted that King -- in 1967 -- had said that police "make a mockery of law."
"He saw how they claim to be about law and order but they're going out breaking up peaceful protests ... and just like they were a mockery of the law in the '50s and '60s, they are a mockery of the law in the 21st century," she said. "Say, 'That ain't right!' "
"That ain't right!" the crowd exclaimed.
Levy Armstrong disputed that police brutality -- including the circumstances of Floyd's killing -- was a matter of a few bad apples.
"So we are here to rise up, continue to take a stand against the system and to keep the legacy of those who have come before us alive and keep the legacy of the people whose lives were stolen [in police killings] alive because they deserve justice," she said.

Chauvins' tax evasion trial moved back to avoid overlap: The ex-officer's court case in death of George Floyd should be over by June 30.

Full text: The tax evasion trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and his estranged wife has been pushed to June 30, by which time his trial on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of George Floyd is expected to be over.
Both Chauvin and Kellie Chauvin appeared remotely Friday in separate and very brief hearings before Washington County District Judge Sheridan Hawley.
The case was set for June at the request of Derek Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, who also represents him in the Floyd case.
The former Minneapolis officer, who is out on bail, faces murder and manslaughter charges in the May 25 killing of Floyd. That trial is set to begin March 8.
Chauvin, the officer who was captured on video kneeling on Floyd's neck, faces the most serious charges of the four officers who were at the scene that evening. The other three will be tried together starting Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
The Chauvins, who had been living in Oakdale, face nine felony tax evasion charges alleging that they underreported $464,433 in joint income from 2014 to 2019. With interest, late fees and fraud penalties, the complaint alleges they owe $37,868.
The complaint also alleges that $96,000 of Derek Chauvin's unreported income came from off-duty security jobs.
The hearings Friday for the couple, who are co-defendants in the case, lasted no more than a couple minutes each. Neither allowed camera access to their appearances or said anything other than, "Yes, your honor."
The tax evasion charges were filed in July, but Washington County Attorney Pete Orput has said the investigation was in the works before Chauvin became globally infamous for his role in Floyd's death.
Orput said the Minnesota Department of Revenue contacted his office about the tax issues in June, but that his office had been sending Chauvin letters since 2019 with no response.
Among other things, prosecutors say the Chauvins bought a new BMW X5 in January 2018 for $100,230 from a Minnetonka dealership and registered the SUV in Florida, where they own a condo.
They paid $4,664 in Florida state taxes on the vehicle even though, according to prosecutors, the BMW was serviced 11 times in Minnetonka and never in Florida. Had they registered the car in Minnesota, the taxes would have been $5,053.
Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce shortly after her husband was charged in Floyd's death. The divorce is still pending in Washington County, where Judge Juanita Freeman recently raised concerns about fraud and ordered the two to file public documents.

Company targets minority startups: Brown Venture Group is the first in Minn. to focus on Black, Latino and Indigenous entrepreneurs.

Author: Kumar, Kavita

https://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/company-targets-minority-startups/docview/2478646787/se-2?accountid=12598

Full text: As they researched the funding gaps that communities of color face, Paul Campbell and Chris Brooks kept coming back to the same troubling fact.
Less than 3% of venture-capital dollars in the U.S. go to startups with Black or Latino founders.
"We were like, 'We need to solve that,' " Brooks said.
That's what they are aiming to do with Minneapolis-based Brown Venture Group. It's not only unusual for a venture-capital firm in that its founders are Black, but it's also Minnesota's first venture-capital firm that is focused exclusively on investing in Black, Latino and Native American entrepreneurs.
Founded in 2018, it's one of a small, but growing number of investment funds dedicated to backing founders of color around the country.
For its inaugural fund, Brown Venture Group has set an ambitious goal of raising $50 million, which would be quite large for any Minnesota-based venture-capital firm and would make it one of the largest funds in the U.S. with a diversity mandate. New York-based Harlem Capital, for example, raised $40 million in its debut fund in 2019.
"It's definitely a big goal, but we don't think it's unrealistic," said Campbell, who added that they are talking to investors from Silicon Valley and Wall Street as well as here in Minnesota. "We feel very good about the interest we've received."
Brown Venture Group started raising funds in June, and Campbell said they are already a quarter of the way to $50 million. He said they expect to hit the goal this spring or early summer.
They plan to invest in startups in various industries across the U.S., but hope a number of them will be based in the Twin Cities.
Campbell and Brooks noted that the energy following the police killing of George Floyd has brought more awareness to racial and economic disparities, and increased financial
commitments from corporations and other groups to address those issues.
"George Floyd's tragic murder has turned into an opportunity to have conversations that nobody was having before," said Brooks. "And for us, it's turned into opportunities to have conversations about investments and creating wealth in communities of color that just haven't candidly been had this way."
Campbell is a St. Paul native who has worked in telecommunications and sales, with previous stints at AT&T, Sprint and Oracle. He has started several businesses and has been a business consultant, too.
Brooks, who is from south Minneapolis, has a diverse resume that includes executive roles at nonprofits, a diversity coach, corporate consultant and a chaplain for Hennepin County juvenile courts.
To beef up their team's expertise, they brought two more Twin Cities executives on board as partners last year. Jerome Hamilton is a former 3M and Stratasys executive and Chris Dykstra is CEO and founding partner of software company Warecorp and a serial entrepreneur.
"I think a really important aspect of our work is developing the entrepreneurs themselves who haven't had a shot," said Dykstra.
They plan to do that by using a "venture studio" model in which they will work to connect founders to mentorship, training and partnerships to help them flesh out their ideas and scale up.
They know that many entrepreneurs of color don't have the generational wealth of many of their white counterparts to raise early-stage funds in what is often known as a friends-and-family round that typically comes before the seed-funding phase. That means it's also more challenging for them to build up a track record to attract venture-capital investment.
"We just always had to hustle that much harder," said Campbell, noting that he often had to bootstrap his companies and was turned down for bank loans when he was starting out.
"Traditional venture capital hasn't worked for communities of color," he added.
To help fill in that gap, Brown Venture Group aims to provide that initial, pre-seed check of between $10,000 to $100,000 for some entrepreneurs who are just starting out in addition to issuing larger checks of $1 million to $3 million for more mature startups.
In the last year or so, Timi Ogundipe, who was born in Nigeria and now lives in Fridley, has met with about a dozen venture-capital firms as he looks to raise his seed round for his startup, Safe Resell. Launched in 2019, his website provides a cashless system for buying and selling items.
His conversations with Brown Venture Group felt a lot different from the rest, he said.
"With Brown, I was able to be myself," he said. "I don't like feeling like I have to impress anybody and that's what I loved about Brown. The first meeting, it felt like I've known them for a while."
The other firms grilled him on his numbers and many assumed he had done or could do a friends-and-family round of funding, he said. But Brown didn't make that assumption. They understood why he was solely self-funded. He added that Brown seemed most focused on his vision and his passion.
Safe Resell is one of the five portfolio companies that Brown Venture Group has committed to so far, and the first one based in the Twin Cities. The others are based in Colorado and Florida.
Brown is also the lead investor in the seed round for Ecolution KWH, which was founded by Latino entrepreneurs and aims to harness unused energy from trucks and trailers into electricity. Brown's specific monetary contribution was not disclosed.
While they are talking to investors and startups across the U.S., they hope the Twin Cities region will play a big role in their efforts.
"We're a Twin Cities-based company," said Brooks. "Paul and I were both born and raised in the Twin Cities. We want to see our city solve this problem. We want the story of the Twin Cities to change from Black boys don't graduate from high school and police murder Black people to, 'Wow, they invested in entrepreneurs of color and there are amazing businesses springing up out of that place.' "
Campbell added that they think there's a lot of untapped potential.
"What would it look like if we were to establish a Fortune 500 company here in the Twin Cities founded by a Black or brown founder?" he said. "That would be an incredible story."

Full text: Four nights after George Floyd died in the custody of Minneapolis police, four men were caught on camera breaking into the Enterprise Rent-A-Car building in St. Paul's Midway neighborhood. They set it on fire.
"It was a total loss," said building owner Paul Gonyea, founder of Gonyea Commercial Properties. "The roof collapsed. The inside walls collapsed. What remained had to be torn down."
The four men were caught by authorities. After delays, hiccups with hazardous debris removal and $800,000 in costs (some not covered by insurance), the building at 1161 University Av. is 85% rebuilt and due to open in March with Enterprise back in as the tenant.
"It's been more difficult than I would like," said Gonyea. "I'm in a hurry to finish this. My tenant wants to be there and they want to open as soon as they can. It's on the Green Line. It's a good spot."
The restored building, one of an estimated 280 buildings damaged during last spring's riots in St. Paul, is a welcome sign of progress for the hard-hit Midway area, a busy 4-mile commercial corridor that scoots along University Avenue -- roughly from the State Capitol to Hwy. 280.
"The area took the brunt of the damage from the riots in St. Paul," Midway Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Chad Kulas told St. Paul Building Owners and Managers Association members during a recent Zoom call to update neighbors about recent improvements. "Piece by piece, we are collecting ourselves and opening up more
and more of the Midway. It's hard to say things will be back to normal in two years," but there is progress.
Local developers such as Reuter Walton, Suntide Commercial Realty, Kraus-Anderson, Cornerstone Construction, Wellington Management Inc. and Gonyea among others have recently worked "the avenue," bulldozing or repairing damaged buildings, replacing broken windows and doors and snatching vacant lots for future development as offices or apartments.
About 12 projects are in the works, equaling hundreds of millions of dollars in development. The recovery "is like after a wildfire, when you start to see vegetation arise from the damage. That's what is happening in Midway," Kulas said.
This week, Kraus-Anderson is demolishing the vacant U.S. Bank branch near Keys Cafe at University and Raymond avenues. The graffiti-covered building KA bought in December will make way for a $50 million apartment building with 220 units. Blocks east, a former boarded-up auto garage at 1835 University Av. was knocked down to prepare for affordable rental units.
Across from the Ax-Man Surplus store near University and Snelling avenues, a soon-to-open Bank of America branch has replaced the shuttered Pawn America. A little over a mile east, an office complex will replace the soon-to-be-razed Johnny Baby's bar at 981 University Av.
"For the neighborhood, we are well aware with daily reminders of what transpired [in May]. But I think there is overall a sense of hope," said Kate Mudge, director of the Hamline Midway Coalition. "We celebrate every time we see a really damaged building come down and get cleaned up or we hear about somebody managing to reopen."
Two new apartment buildings are being built a soccer ball kick away from Allianz Field soccer stadium on land that used to house a Bremer Bank and Furniture Barn. One mile east, Minneapolis-based Alatus LLC plans this summer to begin constructing a six-story $60 million apartment and retail complex near the White Castle at N. Lexington Parkway and University Avenue.
Last year's riots caused Alatus' "builders risk insurance" premium to triple for the 288-unit project to nearly $550,000, said Development Director Chris Osmundson. Insurers re-evaluated their risks for all Minneapolis and St. Paul construction in the wake of the riots.
Not all area projects are on track. The 34-acre Midway Shopping Center and Big Top Liquors near Allianz Field, burned and damaged by water in the riots, remain shut, awaiting demolition. But there's no word from the city or the shopping center's owners Rick Birdoff and Minnesota United FC owner Bill McGuire -- about when the site will be razed.
In 2016, the city approved a master plan for the site to eventually become an "urban village" of offices, apartments, a hotel and parking surrounding Allianz Field, home to Minnesota United. But the master plan lacks a timeline and hasn't been updated since May's fires, city officials said.
Through a spokesman, Birdoff and McGuire declined to comment for this article. Kulas said McGuire told his chamber in July the strip mall would be knocked down, but didn't say when.
Nicolle Goodman, director at St. Paul Planning and Economic Development, said the city doesn't know when work will begin. The city's biggest concern, she said, is that any redevelopment meet the community's needs and not price neighbors out of the area. "Redevelopment is great," she said. "But we need to do everything we can to ensure that the character and the identity of the area don't disappear."
Days after George Floyd's May 25 death, Suntide Principal Jeff Hart watched on TV as protesters gathered by the 1000 University Av. office his team bought and rehabbed 10 years ago. Some rioters spray-painted graffiti and then moved up the block.
Suntide scrubbed off the paint and looked for ways to uplift the neighborhood. They had already bought the building across the street -- Johnny Baby's -- a problematic bar at 981 University Av. Now was the time to knock it down to build nice offices. Demolition starts this spring. "We are trying to do our part and clean up the neighborhood," Hart said.
For University Avenue businesses, the 2020 riots were perhaps the most dramatic of a string of disruptions. They have endured years of light-rail construction that finally ended in 2014. Then Sears, Walmart, and Herberger's stores shut. The global pandemic and recession followed.
Then, in May, rioters torched the street's Enterprise car rental shop, the Sports Dome, Napa Auto Parts, Bole Ethiopian Cuisine's two restaurants and the Midway Shopping Center's Foot Locker, Game Stop and Big Top Liquors. Smoke and water damage wrecked the rest of the strip mall.
"What a whammy! If you survived University Avenue and all of that [2010-2014] light-rail construction, just to live for today? God help you!" said Twin Cities commercial real estate veteran Jim Durda, who now manages the City Center for Ryan Cos.
Setbacks aside, neighbors are encouraged by ripples of progress. Recently dozens of boards came off store windows. Last month a shuttered auto-repair shop near University and Fairview avenues came tumbling down, to be replaced by two affordable apartment buildings, projects worth $64 million. "That's fantastic," said Mudge.
The property held past lives as an Andy's Garage, Andy's Eat Now Diner and a secondhand store. Nothing stuck.
Developer Reuter Walton (RW) bought the site in November and bulldozed it. The St. Paul Housing and Redevelopment Authority approved $30 million in bonds while Bridgewater Bank, AFLCIO-HIT and Fannie Mae made loans. The state spent $330,000 to decontaminate the land.
This week, contractors plan to pour concrete footings for the apartment's coffee shop and underground parking. The project is RW's first on University Avenue.
"The Reuter Walton team is proud that we are able to bring these 243 much-needed affordable homes to the Hamline Midway neighborhood," said CEO Nick Walton.
More housing is coming. Friday, a wrecking ball readied to topple the vandalized former U.S. Bank branch that Kraus-Anderson bought at University and Raymond.
The $64 million effort is KA's latest on University. In March 2019, it paid $31 million for the Midway Marketplace by Hamline Avenue that includes the riot-damaged but restored Cub Foods, TJ Maxx, Dollar Tree, plus the nearby LA Fitness and shuttered Walmart.
KA has been mum about the future of the former Walmart store that shut in 2019.
"We don't have any redevelopment plans for the site at this time," said KA Senior Vice President Matt Alexander.

Full text: A retired Los Angeles police captain who testified that officers didn't use excessive force when they beat Rodney King in 1991 is expected to be called as a defense expert witness in the killing of George Floyd.
Attorney Earl Gray, who is representing former Minneapolis officer Thomas Lane, filed notice Thursday that he plans to call Greg Meyer as a use-of-force expert witness at his client's Aug. 23 trial.
Meyer is also an expert on police training, intervention, detention and arrests, said Gray's filing, which included Meyer's 37-page resume.
Gray did not return a message seeking comment. Meyer declined to comment when reached by phone Thursday at his Los Angeles-area home.
Meyer worked for L.A. police from 1976 to 2006 and testified at a 1994 federal civil trial in the King case that came after the state's criminal trial against four officers charged with beating King.
Meyer has been critical of bans on "neck restraint holds" and "upper-body control" holds, also known as "chokeholds."
Floyd died May 25 after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes while former colleagues J. Alexander Kueng and Lane pinned the rest of Floyd's body stomach-down in the street. Former officer Tou Thao controlled an angry crowd nearby. All four were fired.
Meyer raised questions about the efficacy of neck restraint bans during a 2014 appearance on a National Public Radio show on Eric Garner, who was killed after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold.
"Now you have a big gap in the use-of-force process," Meyer said about such bans. "What are you going to fill that with? Well, it got filled [in L.A.] with the night stick."
In 1991 Los Angeles police officers were trying to stop King, who was unarmed, for speeding when he fled. They used stun guns and beat him with batons following a high-speed chase. Bystander video of the King incident seen around the world stirred concerns about race and policing. King was Black.
In 1992, jurors in the state's case acquitted the officers, leading to several days of riots in L.A. and other cities. The officers were tried in federal court in 1993 on charges that they violated King's civil rights. Two were convicted and received prison time; two were acquitted.
Meyer testified in a third trial that occurred in 1994 -- a federal civil trial to determine whether the city and, independently, the officers -- owed King financial compensation. It was there that he testified that the officers did not use excessive force because of police policy.
Jurors awarded King $3.8 million from the city but decided that the officers did not owe punitive damages.
"The jury learned … that the roots of the King beating were to be found in poor policy which encouraged Los Angeles police officers who encountered resisting suspects to hit them with metal pipes ('police batons,' if one prefers to minimize the impact)," Meyer wrote in a 1994 opinion piece.
In a different opinion piece published that year in the L.A. Times, Meyer blamed the City Council and board of police commissioners for taking "so-called chokeholds" out of "routine use," priming officers to use their batons instead.
"How could the jury hold the officers personally accountable for the results of such a poor policy process?" Meyer wrote.
Meyer implored the public to demand "more rational" policies from their police and urged police to "adopt a more humane use of force on a scale."
"If we can put a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth, why can't we put a man on the ground and take him safely to jail?" Meyer wrote.
Meyer has served as an expert witness in several cases.
The use of outside experts by both defense attorneys and prosecutors is common practice in trials, and retired officers from other agencies are regularly called to assess use of force, training and policies in officer-involved shooting cases.
Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, also filed notice Thursday that he planned to call retired Missouri police officer Steve Ijames as an expert witness. Ijames testified for the defense in the 2020 trial of Washington County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Krook.
Krook shot 23-year-old Benjamin Evans, who was intoxicated, suicidal and armed with a gun, in 2018 without warning while a colleague continued negotiations with Evans in Lake Elmo.
Ijames testified that had Krook warned Evans, it would have sounded like a threat instead. Krook was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter.
Lane, Kueng and Thao are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter and will be tried together. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the case scheduled to begin March 8.

Initiative looks at U, tribal history: Minnesota Transform was born out of unrest after George Floyd's death.

Author: Faircloth, Ryan

Full text: A new University of Minnesota initiative will examine the school's historically fraught relationship with tribal nations and use public humanities projects to educate state residents on racial justice.
Faculty leading the Minnesota Transform initiative will work with Black, Indigenous and immigrant communities to tell stories through digital platforms and public exhibits, revitalize Indigenous languages and write a report on the U's relationship with American Indian tribes, among other things. The initiative will be funded over three years by a $5 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, university leaders announced Wednesday.
"This statewide initiative deepens the university's relationships with our diverse communities, with a focus on developing new knowledge, visions and practices for inclusion and justice," said Rachel Croson, the U's executive vice president and provost.
University leaders cited last year's nationwide protests against racism and police brutality as inspiration for this work.
The report on the U's relationship with tribes is a necessary step toward acknowledging past wrongs, said Tadd Johnson, the university's senior director of tribal nations relations.
During the Cold War, researchers from the university's medical school conducted experiments on residents of the Red Lake Reservation while studying the diseases impetigo and nephritis, Johnson said. Children were injected with penicillin and taken off the reservation, sometimes without their parents knowing. Tribal members want the medical school to explain its actions, Johnson said.
Additionally, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa has sought greater transparency regarding forestry research the university conducts on its land.
"All these negative things happened to the tribes, many of which accrued to the benefit of the university," said Johnson, noting the U was built on Dakota land that was ceded in the treaties of 1837 and 1851.
The tribes and the university will work together on the archival report.
Through digital storytelling and public exhibits, the Minnesota Transform initiative will seek to educate residents across the state about the protests and civil unrest that erupted in the Twin Cities last summer after the killing of George Floyd, said Jigna Desai, a gender, women and sexuality studies professor who's helping lead the new project.
Faculty will also look inward to examine how the university contributes to societal inequities and how it can become more inclusive, Desai said. Leaders of the initiative will work with professors to create a more welcoming classroom environment for students of color and students with disabilities. The initiative will also collaborate with the U's law school to integrate anti-racist teachings.
"There are longer histories that need to be reckoned with," Desai said. "We need frames for exploring white supremacy and its legacies within universities."

Study deplores MPD's less lethal weapons: Crowd-control projectiles injured 89 George Floyd protesters, journal says.

Full text: The police use of less-lethal weapons for crowd control during the George Floyd civil unrest in the Twin Cities led to a significant number of head, neck and face injuries, violating United Nations guidelines for such weapons, according to a study published Wednesday.
The study published in the New England Journal of Medicine said that the findings indicate "that under current practices, projectiles are not appropriate for crowd control."
Conducted by an interdisciplinary team from the University of Minnesota, the study was peer reviewed and published as a letter in the highly respected medical journal.
Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25 triggered large demonstrations in the Twin Cities, some of them leading to confrontations with police, and the looting and burning of businesses. Police used tear gas and nonlethal projectiles as part of crowd control efforts to push back or disperse protesters.
The researchers found that more than half of 89 protesters treated at two Minneapolis hospitals were injured by crowd-control projectiles that are categorized as nonlethal.
According to United Nations guidelines, such projectiles should be aimed at lower extremities.
"What we were seeing is that people were harmed," said Rachel Hardeman, a professor of health and racial equity in the U's School of Public Health and one of the authors of the study.
Protesters and journalists have filed multiple lawsuits against Minneapolis police and the Minnesota State Patrol for injuries sustained during the protests. Complaints to Minneapolis police skyrocketed, and officials acknowledged last summer that some innocent civilians were injured during days of protests and unrest, but argued that the situation required force to maintain public safety and it was difficult to distinguish between peaceful protesters and those wishing to cause harm.
Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said, "All uses of force are being reviewed by the department. Some of the uses of force have resulted in litigation. We are unable to comment on those at this time."
A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, which oversees the State Patrol, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A spokesman for the Minnesota National Guard, which was deployed during the riots, said the Guard did not discharge nonlethal munitions during the civil unrest.
The study in the New England Journal examined injuries treated by clinics and hospitals in the Fairview University and Hennepin Healthcare systems, said Dr. David Darrow, a neurosurgeon and professor at the University's Medical School, who was one of 14 authors of the study.
"We were surprised to see so many injuries to the face and the head and that got us worried," he said.
The study examined 6,626 medical records of patients treated between May 26 to June 15 in 2020 and found that of 89 who were injured in the protests and sought medical help, 45 were injured by projectiles, 32 were injured by chemical irritants and 12 suffered injuries from both projectiles and irritants.
Patients reported 41 injuries from rubber-coated bullets, seven from tear gas canisters, two from beanbags and seven from unknown projectiles.
Ten patients received eye trauma from projectiles, and seven of them required surgery. Sixteen patients received traumatic brain injuries.
Overall, 77 patients had what the study found were mild injuries, eight had moderate injuries and four were classified as severe.
Erika Kaske, a medical student and one of the authors, said the case that inspired the study was the injury of a teenager who received a depressed skull fracture during one of the first protests.
The teenager was a bystander. The youth had emergency brain surgery and has since fully recovered, she said. She said less-than-lethal weapons are inherently inaccurate because they move at lower speeds and are larger than lethal bullets.
She said there's no way to know if officers intended to hit people in the head with projectiles, but even when trying to use them correctly, serious injury can result.
"Our hope is to work with policymakers to prevent these type of injuries from happening again," she said.
As a result of a court order in August initiated by the state Department of Human Rights, Minneapolis police policy states that authorization for crowd control weapons can only come from the police chief or the chief's designee.
If there's an immediate danger, crowd control devices, except chemical munitions, may be used, but supervisors must be then notified and a report filed.
Last year, the United Nations human rights committee issued a report that said that kinetic impact projectiles (rubber-coated or plastic bullets) should aim at striking the lower abdomen or legs of a violent individual and only used where there's imminent threat of injury to either a law enforcement official or a member of the public.
The head, face and neck should not be targeted, the report said: "Targeting the face or head may result in skull fracture and brain injury, damage to the eyes, including permanent blindness, or even death," it said.

Chauvin to be tried separately: The other three former officers will still be tried together in death of George Floyd.

Full text: Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's trial in connection with George Floyd's death will take place in March, while his three former colleagues will stand trial five months later.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill's order splitting the trial into two reverses his previous position on the matter, and presents a host of challenges and advantages for the prosecution and defense attorneys.
Chauvin will be tried in Hennepin County starting March 8; J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, who also were all fired, will be tried in one trial starting Aug. 23, Cahill ruled in an order made public Tuesday.
The judge wrote that COVID-19, social distancing protocol and uncertainty about the vaccine rollout prevented the four defendants from being tried in one trial as he previously ruled in November.
"The physical limitations of courtroom C-1856, the largest courtroom in the Hennepin County Government Center, make it impossible to comply with COVID-19 physical restrictions in a joint trial," Cahill wrote.
The revelation occurred last Friday when the four defense attorneys consulted with Hennepin County Chief Judge Toddrick Barnette and expressed their intentions to each have a second attorney or a legal aide at their table during trial. Barnette e-mailed Cahill last Friday urging him to split up the trial because of COVID concerns, noting that the courtroom could accommodate three defendants at most.
Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office is leading the prosecution with assistance from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, maintained that all four defendants should be tried together to avoid retraumatizing witnesses and family members, and to limit prejudicing potential jurors between trials.
His office previously requested one trial, and filed a motion last month asking Cahill to delay the trial until June 7 when more people would be vaccinated against COVID-19.
"We believe, and independent public health experts agree, that with the advent of the vaccine the threat will be significantly abated by mid-year," Ellison said in a written statement. "… Nevertheless, we are fully prepared and look forward to presenting our case to a jury whenever the Court deems fit."
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, and Thao's attorneys, Robert and Natalie Paule, also filed separate motions last month asking to delay the trial to an unspecified date and to July 5, respectively, in order to deal with copious evidence.
Nelson and Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, declined to comment on Cahill's most recent ruling. Robert Paule and Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, said, "Good. I had a motion pending for severance."
Cahill also ruled that prosecutors did not intentionally mishandle how evidence was shared with defense attorneys. Each defense attorney argued at a hearing last week that prosecutors shared irrelevant material, sandwiched key evidence in between unimportant information, provided duplicates and missed deadlines.
Prosecutors shared evidence as they received it from the source, Cahill ruled, adding that one document was shared several days late in violation of the court's deadlines.
Veteran attorneys and law professors said the new scheduling arrangement will strain the state's resources and spare Chauvin the trouble of fending off co-defendants who blame him for Floyd's death.
It also strongly favors the three defendants who will stand trial in August, they said.
"I'd rather be the attorney for one of the three [co-defendants] than the attorney for Chauvin right now," said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter; the others are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
"It's very hard on witnesses, it's hard on the court system and it's hard on the prosecutor to do repeat trials of largely the same evidence," said former Ramsey County Attorney Susan Gaertner. "That certainly is amplified in a case like this where there is so much public attention."
Each defense attorney previously requested a separate trial, citing antagonistic defenses. Kueng and Lane's attorneys have blamed Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes and was the most senior officer at the scene.
Thao's attorneys have said he was controlling an angry crowd and never laid a hand on Floyd as his colleagues pinned Floyd stomach-down in the street.
"The problem in joint trials is you have to be just as careful about what your [co-defendant] does as what the prosecutor does," said defense attorney Joe Friedberg, who is not involved in the case.
One possible pitfall of the separate trials, Friedberg noted, is it reduces the chances of a jury compromising with its verdict by convicting some defendants and acquitting others.
Kueng, Lane and Thao's attorneys will have the rare opportunity to preview their clients' trial by watching Chauvin's trial, which will be livestreamed. That will give them valuable insight into the prosecution's posture in the case, Cahills rulings and witnesses' strengths and weaknesses.
"It's always helpful to see what the prosecution's going to do," Daly said. "In some ways, it's like a play and you try to organize [a trial] in a way that will have the most affect on the jurors."
Chauvin's absence from their trial could also cool any juror's negative feelings toward them, legal scholars said.
"There's always the guilt-by-association problem, and it flows downhill to the accomplices," said Richard Frase, a University of Minnesota law professor and co-director of the Robina Institute of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice.

Full text: DULUTH - Police Chief Mike Tusken is asking the city to approve a charter change that would create a third deputy chief position to oversee the department's administrative division, which handles tasks such as training and hiring, in response to calls from the community to improve law enforcement in the wake of George Floyd's death.
The new role would be created through internal restructuring and would not increase the number of officers employed by the agency. The Duluth Police Department's 2021 budget is just over $24 million and increased only $1,000 from last year.
Currently, Duluth Deputy Police Chief Laura Marquardt supervises the department's investigative and administrative divisions.
"When we are head-down doing police work, you have to have somebody that's still head-down looking at: What are we doing for training, recruitment and retention?" Tusken said. "What are we doing to keep up on complaints? How do we know we are continuing to do best practices?"
The Duluth agency consists of about 158 sworn officers and 40 civilian staff members. Tusken said about 45 employees are considered part of the administrative division, which includes records and technology staff, license and permit compliance officials, community service officers, animal control and the city's parking services.
Duluth's Charter Commission will consider the proposal at its Wednesday meeting. If approved, the motion to amend the charter -- by changing the number of deputy police chiefs allowed from two to three -- will go before the City Council for a final vote.
Tusken said he heard "loud and clear" from Duluth residents asking for increased accountability for local officers after Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police.
"I think creating this executive leadership position for oversight shows it's important," he said.
Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said she supports Tusken's effort, calling the Police Department "ahead of the curve in many ways," referencing the agency's body camera policy and longstanding ban on chokeholds.
Dozens of residents spoke at City Council meetings or e-mailed officials during the summer and fall urging them to remove police funding and invest it in social services, but the movement did not pick up steam among Duluth's elected leaders.
"I think the more we can expand efficiently how we're both reflecting and engaging in the community, the more we can train around the values that are important to the community members that are speaking to us about worries," Larson said.

Mpls. police union head to retire on Jan. 31

Full text: Bob Kroll, the incendiary Minneapolis police lieutenant whose role as president of the Minneapolis Police Federation made him a lightning rod in the debate over race and policing, announced plans Monday to retire from the department.
Kroll, 58, who was already eligible for retirement, will leave the force at the end of the month, he said in a letter to federation members. His retirement comes nearly eight months after the death of George Floyd in police custody, an incident that generated weeks of protests and calls for the defunding, or even abolishment, of the state's largest police force. It also comes amid continuing fallout from the siege on the U.S. Capitol last week by supporters of President Donald Trump, whom Kroll has aligned himself with publicly.
In the letter, obtained by the Star Tribune, Kroll says that he initially planned to retire in May, but "after reviewing the bigger picture, it is in my family's best interest for me to retire four months early."
Kroll's second-in-command at the Police Federation, Sgt. Sherral Schmidt, is expected to serve out the rest of his term. Kroll did not respond to a message seeking comment.
"Most difficult for me as I made this decision was to see how our noble profession has been demonized. The toughest part of the job was witnessing the scrutiny and criticism [we] as professionals have endured from those who do not walk in our shoes. Yet these people turned into self-proclaimed experts into every aspect of our line of work," he wrote. "The low point of my career has been watching this occur over the last three decades and how weak administrations pandered to armchair quarterbacks and didn't fight for hardworking public servants who wear the badge."
Kroll often clashed with chiefs and mayors alike, including current Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who tweeted an article about Kroll's departure and wrote: "Good riddance."
Frey said Kroll's departure will "create an opportunity for the incoming union leadership to improve its relationship" with City Hall and police administration.
Although it makes no mention of recent events, Kroll's retirement announcement comes less than a week after a mob of pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in attempts to disrupt Congress' certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory. Kroll, an outspoken Trump supporter, appeared on stage with him at a Minneapolis campaign rally at the Target Center in late 2019.
Kroll joined the department in 1989 and was elected to his first two-year term as union president in 2015.
In a radio interview in August, Kroll said that public backlash had persuaded him to stay with the department, despite having reached retirement age.
"Now these people are causing me to stay, because I can't make it look like they're chasing me out. I've never backed away from a fight in my life," he said. "The same people who want me gone so bad, from the protesters to the mayor to the City Council to the governor, now they're getting me stuck here longer, so the joke's on you."
In recent months, critics from Frey to Gov. Tim Walz have pointed to the politically influential union as a significant roadblock to reforming the department. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo cited the union's resistance to reforms for his decision to withdraw from police contract negotiations. The city has since returned to the bargaining table. A Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 poll from last year found that nearly 80% of residents believe the union has too much influence over the disciplining of officers accused of misconduct.
Greg Hestness, a former Minneapolis deputy police chief, said the time might be right for "new leadership," particularly as Kroll's relationship has deteriorated with the chief. He said whoever is picked to be the next president will say a lot about the direction of the department.
"When he was reelected, I thought that said a lot about the culture in the department at that moment, and the next election might be another test of it, after they've endured the death of George Floyd and the riots, and the dismissal of them by the City Council -- maybe they're looking for a new approach," Hestness said. "New leadership is always healthy after a long time."
Kroll said in a 2019 Star Tribune profile that he intended to step down when his term ended this spring and hand over leadership to Schmidt, his longtime No. 2. A special election may follow at some point.
Critics say that in some ways Kroll has come to embody an aggressive style of policing that has fallen out of favor. But they also question whether removing Kroll from office would automatically lead to changes, pointing out that many of the department's problems predate his tenure with the federation.
But while many of the officers who elected Kroll also likely share his worldview, others may have voted for someone who they felt would support them at a time when law enforcement is under scrutiny like never before.
According to the Office of Police Conduct Review, Kroll is the subject of three open complaints, which will be closed once he retires.

The 'what abouts' don't seek solutions

Full text: When I answered the phone, north Minneapolis activist K.G. Wilson warned me before our conversation started.
"Anybody knows," he said, "don't call me unless you want the truth!"
I could hear the emotion in his voice as he listed the killings he'd protested over the years in his effort to end Black-on-Black crime in the Twin Cities. He said he's stood alone on quiet street corners to draw attention to the heinous acts that have robbed young Black men and women of their lives. He's also questioned the support for mass protests against police killings of unarmed minorities, an energy that's often missing at his rallies.
"Many people will say, Black Lives Matter only comes out when there is a police-involved shooting," he told me. "But I tell them that's because that's what they do. That's their focus and mission. That's not what I do. I deal with what we don't want to talk about."
That's a discussion that's percolated in the Black community for ages. Have we devoted enough energy toward the always-pressing issue of violence? I respect Wilson's position. He's devoted his time to change.
But I also refuse to engage another element that's grown louder since the protests over the killing of George Floyd: the "What about Black-on-Black crime?" crowd. Recently, a video on the Star Tribune's website featured a conversation between a Minneapolis police officer and a protester at the site of Dolal Idd's deadly encounter with officers, reportedly during an attempted gun sting. "How many homicides?" the officer asked. "You don't protest that. Your city is burning and you don't care about that."
I question the intent of those who employ that rhetoric in these moments.
After each Sunday column, I get e-mails from white readers who prefer I opine about violence in Black communities, absentee fathers, educational challenges and their other long-held talking points to support their negative views of minorities. I ignore them because they're not worth my time or yours. Let me explain.
A real conversation involves two people -- or parties -- acting in good faith to discuss a comprehensive issue. In these scenarios, however, the individuals are bad actors who prefer to ignore systemic inequities and their effect on communities of color. Their "What about Black-on-Black violence?" mantra isn't a concern. It's a shield. In their collective opinion, Black folks encourage, uphold and commit to values that lead to violence. But they won't converse about the lack of resources and limited opportunities that have a pronounced effect on the acts of violence in Minnesota's Black neighborhoods. It's an impossible and fruitless dialogue.
"We've got to look at the reason why there is a lot of Black-on-Black violence," said DJ Hooker, an organizer with the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, formed after Jamar Clark's killing by Minneapolis police in 2014. "We have to look at the structure that's built so Black people don't get the same opportunities. You haven't provided them with resources to help get them out of this cycle."
I've attended multiple funerals of young Black men felled by gang violence or disputes involving guns. I've seen their families and friends wail from church pews. There is a chorus -- a chorus that exists for those entangled in the ongoing violence -- of Black people who've done their best to steer them toward more prosperous life choices. Black folks in those communities don't teach those actions. They pray against them.
But a young man or woman with a gun and an intent to use it is 1,000 feet tall in any neighborhood. That's not cultural. That's humanity.
When I was a child in Milwaukee, my parents moved my family north of the city after a neighbor nearly lost his life in a violent assault over a Starter jacket. A family friend got killed for his Jordans. A few years later, it was a 15-year-old cousin. Then, family friends Reggie and Phil. And I remember when my father took my friends and me to Nate's funeral. He didn't live to see his 20th birthday.
The complexities of this issue may never change. But surrendering to attempts to guilt-trip Black people about violence in pockets of the Twin Cities as a deterrent to having larger conversations about systemic problems won't help anyone. The individuals who highlight those hurdles, within that specific context, do not want a resolution, change or progress. Only a fight.
I discussed this with Hooker, who made an important point. Yes, more protests against violence in Black communities can happen, he said, but only with caution, knowing it's imperative to avoid any suggestion that this is an "inherent" or "cultural" problem.
"George Floyd, police brutality -- all of this is interconnected," he said. "These are the result of the same system, coming out in different ways."
It's a vital conversation but one that demands honest investors, not those who simply want to deflect.
Toward the end of my discussion with Wilson, the north Minneapolis activist, I asked him a question: "Do I have to choose between protesting murders and shootings and protesting George Floyd's death and other police killings?"
He paused for a moment.
"If you want to do both," he said, "do both."

Fresh frustration fuels Minneapolis march: Calling anew for racial justice, demonstrators cited inequity in how protests are handled.

Full text: A crowd in downtown Minneapolis on Saturday demanding racial justice expressed, as usual at such events, frustration and anger. And the rally featured the usual passionate speeches, hand-held signs and fiery chants.
But this time, the outrage seemed to have climbed a notch higher than in the frequent demonstrations that have been held in the Twin Cities since George Floyd's May 25 death in the hands of Minneapolis police.
Several hundred people gathered to protest the death of Dolal Idd, a Black man shot and killed by Minneapolis police last month after he fired a gun at them, and Jacob Blake, a Black man shot and wounded by police in Kenosha, Wis., last year. A Wisconsin prosecutor announced last week that no charges would be filed against the officer who shot Blake.
"By any means necessary!" several people shouted, echoing Malcolm X's cry for racial justice.
What intensified the demonstrators' anger and frustration was that most had seen last week's TV news coverage of the mayhem last week when a mob, including apparent white supremacists, stormed the U.S. Capitol, overwhelming police who appeared to take little action against them.
"We woke up to an America that, for the first time in a long time, saw its ugly true face a couple of days ago at the Washington, D.C., Capitol House," said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Minnesota. "After George Floyd was killed, we thought Minneapolis said, 'Enough was enough.' We thought Minneapolis police said, 'Enough was enough.' But not too long ago, they killed Dolal Idd. … And they are still spinning their wheels today."
The crowd marched from the Hennepin County Government Center through downtown Minneapolis, chanting, "What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!" "No justice, no peace! Prosecute the police!" and "When Black lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up and fight back!"
Many held handwritten signs with slogans that included "Blue Lives Murder" and "MPD To-Do List: Stop killing Black bodies, stop killing Black bodies, stop killing Black bodies."
They stopped in front of the Minneapolis Police Department's First Precinct Station for more speeches and chants.
Minneapolis police say they want to "break up gangs," Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minneapolis attorney and civil right activist, told the crowd. "They're the biggest gang in the city of Minneapolis."
Among the speakers were people whose family members had been killed by police, including Idd's father, Bayle Gelle of Eden Prairie.
"I know my son is not coming back … he was a sweet son," Gelle said. "We have to stick together and fight for our rights."
Colin Owens of Minneapolis, who attended the rally, said it was the second time he'd protested.
"It's good to hear the stories," said Owens, who is white. "I'm so sick of this. … Even my dad was like, 'We can't do anything about this.'
"I just felt so alone," he said. "It's great to be here among people who feel like they can actually make a difference."

A nation left violated: AMERICA FORCED TO FACE THREAT FROM WITHIN ; Confusion, revulsion and hope for change

Full text: Christine Smith was working at her St. Paul home on Wednesday afternoon when her phone started pinging. Friends and colleagues at the Minnesota Department of Health told her of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. She pulled up Facebook to follow along.
"My first immediate reaction was a fear just like terror, and then it went to sadness," said Smith, a 42-year-old mother of two.
Minnesotans and Americans across the country still sound shocked and saddened by the violent insurrection that engulfed the nation's Capitol, producing almost unimaginable images, and they are somberly grappling with what comes next. The White House lurched into the weekend in turmoil amid growing calls to remove the president from office for stoking the insurgency as President-elect Joe Biden prepares for a scaled down inauguration in less than two weeks.
The new year was supposed to be restorative after a horrific 2020 in Minnesota, in the United States and around the globe: a pandemic that has killed 365,000 in the United States and upended daily life. The biggest, most sudden economic collapse since the Great Depression. A movement for racial justice unparalleled since the civil rights movement, sparked by protests and riots in the Twin Cities after the police killing of George Floyd. A bitterly divided electorate during a presidential election.
On Friday afternoon, Marcia Howard, a Marine Corps veteran and high school teacher, stood guarding a barricade at E. 38th Street and Elliot Avenue, one block east of where George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in May. Howard lives just down the street, and she helps oversee security at the Floyd memorial. She couldn't help but see Wednesday "a scene out of a dystopian science-fiction action movie, hordes of people crawling through the windows of our nation's Capitol" through the lens of Floyd's killing.
"The military response to Black Lives Matter was a show of force unlike anything we'd seen: dark-clad military or paramilitary people in a line, as if protecting from a foreign invader," she said. "It was for show, it was for theater, but they all were armed. If you saw the capitulation of Capitol police -- taking selfies, ushering in teeming hordes of white people -- there's no greater argument for why we are standing at these four occupied blocks."
And yet Howard was saddened that what happened in D.C. didn't elicit a more forceful national response.
"Why isn't the world stopping?" she said. "This should have been like 9/11. There we have, writ large for the entire world to see, white folks mad that Black people had the power to vote and change the administration, and the Department of Defense was not allowed to call on the National Guard to defend that, our nation's Capitol. And yet there doesn't seem to be an earth-shattering reckoning on what America is going through right now."
The 9/11 comparison resonated with Harry Welty, a 70-year-old Duluth man who challenged U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber in last year's GOP congressional primary. Sept. 11, 2001, was the last time he'd stayed glued to his television like this. Though he once voted consistently for the GOP, Welty has been a longtime critic of Trump.
"That was the last gasp of the Trump world," he said. "It's like Pandora's box. He's unleashed all kinds of things that I think could follow us for some time."
Jeanne Coulter Vogel, a 70-year-old retired elementary school principal, was watching Trump's rally on Fox News when she thought she heard him tell the crowd he would march to the Capitol with them. That couldn't be, she thought at her Eagan home. She rewound the tape; sure enough, that was what he said.
Vogel has visited the Minnesota State Capitol. She knows the tight security there; surely the U.S. Capitol is even more strict. Then she saw rioters busting past a sparse group of police officers.
"Our own president, directing a siege on the nation's Capitol," she said.
Vogel voted for Joe Biden. She is originally from a small town outside Marshall, and plenty of family members are avid Trump supporters. She recalls how they spoke to her four years ago.
"How many times were we told, 'Trump won, just get over it?' " she said. "When Joe Biden comes on, we'll have somebody who'll calm waters. He always says he'll be a president for everybody, not just those who supported me. I find that very, very calming."
Ruth Holm of Faribault voted for Trump. She said she believes there was fraudulent activity in the November elections, but not enough to overturn the vote or support Trump's claim that the presidency was stolen. She believes it's time to move on with Biden. She was upset by last week's violence; she's against violence in all forms, and considers Martin Luther King Jr. a favorite historical figure. She wants arrests of those who broke the law.
However, she doesn't put the blame on Trump, and she doesn't believe the president did anything impeachment-worthy.
"We're allowed to protest, we're allowed to do things legally," she said. "I'm tired of hearing that Trump did this or did that. He didn't go onto social media and say, 'Go into the Capitol, break it, burn it, destroy things.' "
Smith, who works for the health department, saw something much different, both perfectly straightforward -- extremists committing something akin to domestic terrorism -- and impossibly complex.
As a health equity and tribal grants supervisor, Smith has spent her career studying historical trauma. For her, just as important as looking toward the future is examining how our past led us to this point. Last week must be put in historical context: What it means to America's historically oppressed people to see a group of white extremists being treated far more gently than she believes a group of Black rioters would have been, but also what unique personal and historical trauma brought Wednesday's mob to the point of insurrection. A dive into that complexity could turn Wednesday into more than a horrific historical moment. It could become a national turning point.
"If we want to fix the car, we need to lift up the hood and be willing to look at our collective issues," Smith said.
JaNa Bates, she woke up Wednesday morning with a sense of hope. The Georgia runoffs were the night before; a southern state whose history is pocked with racial injustice and voter suppression had turned the U.S. Senate from red to blue. As communications director for Isaiah, a Minnesota coalition of faith communities that fights for racial and economic justice, she's been intimately involved in racial justice. She hopes history remembers last week's events in that proper context.
"They fought so hard to be able to make sure folks have a voice, and their voices are finally able to be heard," Bates said of Democratic victories in the Georgia runoffs. "And you have a few hundred folks clearly in opposition to that vision for all America, and they're storming the Capitol for a very small sliver of America -- in that context, it's a hopeful thing to me. When you cut off the head of the demon, they're going to thrash the hardest in their dying moment."

Full text: A Minneapolis police officer who served as an anonymous source for a GQ magazine article criticizing the department's "toxic culture" was later reprimanded for speaking to the press without permission, according to disciplinary records.
The records show that officer Colleen Ryan received a letter of reprimand on Dec. 2 after an investigation that began with a tip to the department's ethics hotline.
"As Chief of Police I am responsible for providing clear expectations on what is acceptable behavior in our workplaces as well as what will not be tolerated," MPD Chief Medaria Arradondo wrote in his decision to discipline Ryan. "Officer Ryan by our department policy should have contacted and sought permission from our MPD [public information officer] prior to engaging in the interview with the journalist," Arradondo wrote.
Ryan was identified publicly in the document posted on the city's website. The disciplinary records, which include cases against four other officers, were released Friday in response to an earlier court order from an ongoing human rights investigation of the department that was launched after George Floyd's death.
The case stems from a June 10 article, titled "A Minneapolis Police Officer Opens Up About the Toxic Culture Inside the Department," in which Ryan was quoted under the pseudonym "Megan Jones," describing herself as a "liberal feminist" who is "something of an outcast." She criticized what she described as the MPD's "toxic" culture of discouraging officers from calling out colleagues' bad behavior.
"I want better for my department and I wish it didn't take the murder of George Floyd for this national conversation on police reform to be had," she was quoted as saying, adding that her position as an officer afforded her "a unique perspective on the system that enabled the murder of Floyd."
According to the disciplinary record, Ryan contacted the story's author, Laura Bassett, via Twitter while gathering information for her master's project.
The investigation found that Ryan agreed to be quoted for the story, but on the condition of anonymity, because officers are prohibited from talking to journalists without prior permission.
Bassett later tweeted that she received a call from someone with the department asking her to divulge her source.
"This is extremely Trump-like," she wrote. "Maybe spend those resources investigating why your officers kill Black people?"
After being interviewed by investigators, Ryan admitted to being interviewed for the story and expressed regret for the "bad press the article generated for the Minneapolis Police Department," the records show.
Ryan hasn't in the past shied away from sharing her views publicly, writing in an op-ed for the Star Tribune last year that she was in strong favor of stronger gun laws. In the piece, she identified herself as a police officer and a board member for Protect Minnesota, a statewide nonprofit that advocates for gun-safety measures. In a statement released Friday, the organization said it stood behind Ryan, citing her "strength and willingness to address that we need intentional change."
Under department policy, most requests for interviews and other press inquiries are funneled through the public information officer, officials say, to prevent most officers from releasing potentially sensitive information. In practice, the ban on talking to journalists is often used to stifle information that could paint the department in a bad light, experts say.
Much like corporate America, image-conscious police departments began hiring public relations staff to get their message out as law enforcement became professionalized in recent decades, according to media critic David Brauer.
"As a citizen, I am just really glad that somebody breached the blue wall of silence. I mean the big problem we have in this city is we can't separate the cops who want to do good and want to do good stuff internally, from the cops who want to fight stuff," said Brauer, a retired longtime journalist who last worked as a media critic for the MinnPost news site. "As a citizen, I want to know if there's a toxic culture within the department."
The department's media policy hardened during the tenure of Arradondo's predecessor, Jane Harteau, who was accused of withdrawing a job offer after then-senior commander Eddie Frizell was quoted in the Star Tribune that he was "dismayed" with his demotion. Frizell is now Metro Transit police chief.
While Arradondo has had a more cordial relationship with the local press, he has also disciplined officers for speaking to the media, including demoting his own chief of staff Art Knight after Knight's comments in a Star Tribune article last fall prompted an internal backlash.

Floyd protest veterans decry inequality of police restraint

Full text: In the protests following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Deshann Sanchez was tear-gassed in the face by law enforcement and struck in the leg with a rubber bullet.
After setting up several medical tents, she saw one demonstrator spitting out teeth and trying not to choke on her own blood after a police-fired rubber projectile hit her in the mouth. So when Sanchez saw footage of a mob storming the Capitol in Washington, D.C., with little resistance from law enforcement, it was a reminder of why she has been fighting for racial justice.
"We've seen a huge overresponse when it's Black Lives Matter or people of color protesting in response to a loss of life," said Sanchez, president of Justice Frontline Aid, which provides medical assistance and other resources to protesters. "It's complete day and night [compared with] the
underresponse for something as big as our nation's Capitol where there are senators, private documents … and it begs the question: Why?"
The insurrection in Washington is reigniting the debate in Minnesota and across the country over how law enforcement responds in times of riots, violence and protesting.
The violence in Washington offers some parallels to the rioting that engulfed Minneapolis in May after the police killed Floyd. Police in Minneapolis endured widespread criticism for appearing to stand by and let rioters destroy property and set fires.
The city of Minneapolis abandoned the Third Precinct police station rather than engage in combat with rioters who looted the building and set it on fire following Floyd's death.
But the police department also faced condemnation for its use of force against a diverse group of peaceful protesters, and the agency is being sued by people who say they suffered serious injuries, including the loss of an eye, after officers pushed back crowds with tear gas and rubber projectiles.
"The … response by law enforcement to the actions of white people running around shows there's clearly a double standard in U.S. law enforcement, and it delegitimizes it," said Mel Reeves, a longtime civil rights activist.
In D.C., more than 60 trespassers were arrested, and police fatally shot a rioter climbing through a Capitol window; three others died from medical incidents at the scene.
Rioters attacked police with lead pipes, sprayed chemical irritants and took up arms against officers, according to news reports.
Other videos also offered contrasts between the handling of Black Lives Matter protesters and violent Donald Trump supporters who stormed the Capital in Washington, including one viral video that appeared to show a police officer posing for selfies with rioters.
President-elect Joe Biden addressed the topic in his Thursday address.
"No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday that they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the mob that stormed the Capitol," Biden said. "We all know that's true -- and it's unacceptable."
Local activists expect to address the matter during a demonstration at noon Saturday at the Hennepin County Government Center, where they will protest the shootings of Dolal Idd, a Black man shot and killed by Minneapolis police last month, and Jacob Blake, a Black man shot and paralyzed by Kenosha, Wis., police in August. The Kenosha County prosecutor announced this week that his office would not file charges against the officer who shot Blake.
Arizona State University criminology professor Edward Maguire said it was a "really reasonable concern" for activists to question why the law enforcement response seemed so hands-off, especially in comparison to the unrest that erupted over the police killings of Black Americans. He said more questions should be asked about "just what were these officers instructed to do and by whom."
Lex Berndt felt targeted during the Floyd protests even after clearly self-identifying as a volunteer medic.
Berndt and fellow volunteers coughed and gagged after police threw tear gas cans at their medic van. They felt terrorized by the officers standing around holding assault rifles as helicopters roared overhead.
Berndt noted that the president's tweets in May that seemed to incite violence against protesters did not apply to those storming the Capitol.
"Donald Trump said, 'When the looting starts, the shooting starts,' but some man stole a literal podium [at the Capitol] -- didn't see him get shot," Berndt said.
Members of Congress will be reviewing the police response and urged residents not to jump to conclusions.
"The after-action review will determine what failures occurred and why," U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., told USA Today. "The plans should have anticipated the potential for what happened today."
Ashley Qui±ones has attended racial justice protests from Minneapolis to Louisville, Ky., to Kenosha and has seen the harsh response that demonstrators received from authorities.
"I think it was perfect for the world to see the stark difference in how people of color are treated versus whites in America," said Qui±ones, executive director of Justice Squad, a racial justice organization she founded after Richfield and Edina police killed her husband, Brian Qui±ones, in 2019.
Little Earth resident Margarita Ortega, who is running for a City Council seat in Minneapolis' Ninth Ward, said she believes police are enforcers and supporters of white supremacy, and she said they shouldn't protect only one race.
"I know on the first night of the protests, police were already firing on protesters [with rubber bullets]," she said. "I know because I was one of the first ones who were shot in the head."
Zellie Imani recalled what he said was one of the scariest moments of his life. While walking to their car during a Minneapolis protest following Floyd's death, Imani and some friends, all of them Black, were ordered by police to stop or they would be shot.
"This has to be a lesson to all of us that the issue isn't whether or not police need to have more restraint or need more training," said Imani, a Black Lives Matter activist based in Paterson, N.J., who traveled here for the Floyd demonstrations.
"They have enough training. They have enough restraint. … The real issue is who they have restraint for and who they choose to de-escalate and not de-escalate with."

Floyd evidence case fight still on: The judge did not rule on postponing trial or whether prosecutors mishandled discovery.

Full text: Defense attorneys for the ex-Minneapolis police officers charged with killing George Floyd continued to lodge accusations Thursday against prosecutors, alleging that they mishandled sharing evidence with them, provided irrelevant materials and divulged information late.
The issue arose at a contentious motion hearing where Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill weighed whether to postpone the March 8 trial and whether to sanction the prosecution based on the allegations, among other issues.
Cahill issued no rulings Thursday.
"It's ongoing and it's very aggravating," said Thomas Plunkett, who represents former Minneapolis officer J. Alexander Kueng. "It's not what I'm used to dealing with, with attorneys I hold in high regard. Maybe the magnitude of the case is getting to them."
Kueng and his former colleagues Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in Floyd's May 25 death. Former officer Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter for pinning his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes before he died.
Cahill told Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank he believes the prosecution acted in "good faith" in sharing evidence with the defense teams, but he pressed Frank on why his office took nine days to divulge an interview that Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Baker gave to investigators.
Baker told investigators Floyd's death was caused by his health issues combined with his exertion and restraint by police when he was pinned on his stomach in the street.
"It seems like the first thing you do is … stamp it, send it through the scanner and send it to counsel," Cahill said, adding that the lag time was "essentially not complying with the court's order."
"I don't remember specifically," Frank said, noting that the delay was partly due to the document originating with federal authorities. "We are trying to get stuff out, and we're doing that as quickly as we can."
Defense attorneys Robert Paule, Natalie Paule and Eric Nelson filed separate motions in December alleging that prosecutors mishandled "discovery," the process of sharing evidence with defense attorneys.
The Paules, who represent Thao, asked Cahill to sanction the prosecution and postpone the trial to July 5 because of delays caused by discovery issues. Nelson, who represents Chauvin, asked to delay the trial to an unspecified date for the same reason.
Thao's attorneys said the Baker document was relevant to their motion to dismiss charges against Thao, but it was shared late and rendered useless.
Robert Paule argued Thursday that the prosecution previously took issue with defense claims that drugs were found in Floyd's car and rejected a different motion in Thao's case, only to later search the car in December and find pills that allegedly contained methamphetamine and fentanyl.
"I don't think this is simply a coincidence," Paule said.
Nelson and Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, also voiced concerns Thursday.
"I don't think we're getting stuff in nine days," Nelson said. "I think we're getting [evidence] more in 30 days."
Among their concerns were thousands of pages of evidence shared as a single PDF that could not be searched without converting the file, and important evidence sandwiched in between irrelevant materials.
Cahill previously ordered prosecutors to share all evidence with defense attorneys by Aug. 14, and to divulge any evidence that surfaced afterward within 24 hours.
Frank defended his office and called the allegations "unfounded and just inappropriate."
"We are doing the best we can with a huge amount of discovery," he said.
Frank apologized for the delay in the Baker document but said his office shared all evidence it received from Minneapolis police and other sources, and in the order and format they arrived in.
Special attorney for the state Neal Katyal told Cahill prosecutors were "100 percent ready" to try the case in March, but filed a motion in December to postpone it to June 7 so more people could be vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect trial participants and the public.
Robert Paule alleged that the prosecution's motion to delay the trial was a cover for revisiting its arguments to prohibit the livestreaming of the trial.
Cahill previously ruled that the trial will be livestreamed because the pandemic would severely restrict public access to the trial courtroom, and later denied the prosecution's request for him to rescind the order.
"This is a cloaked attempt to deal with that," Paule said.
Katyal did not address Paule's claims.
Cahill noted that postponing the trial because of COVID-19 would simply put participants in other cases at risk.
"It's a question of who has to take the risk," Cahill said. "Somebody is going to be in courtroom 1856 come March 8."

LIQUID ASSETS: BREWERY ENDURED LONG ROAD TO FRUITION ; ARBEITER BREWING CO. FACED HURDLE AFTER HURDLE BEFORE FINALLY OPENING LAST MONTH.

Full text: Opening a new brewery is difficult under ideal circumstances. Costs are high. Finding appropriate real estate can be a challenge. And in this heavily regulated industry, the labyrinth of federal, state and municipal licenses, permits and approvals can take years to navigate.
For Arbeiter Brewing Co., which launched in December with taproom sales and limited retail availability, the circumstances were far from ideal. The startup process for the brewery in Minneapolis' Longfellow neighborhood mirrors the chaos of the past few years. From a government shutdown and tariffs to the pandemic and the unrest following the killing of George Floyd, the path was strewn with hurdles, making it all the sweeter to finally move beer out the door.
In 2018, having leased the former Harriet Brewing space near the corner of Minnehaha Avenue and E. Lake Street, the founding crew of Garth Blomberg, Josh Voeltz and
Juno Choi were awaiting approval for federal permits. Then, in December of that year, came what would become the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.
With hundreds of new breweries opening across the country, the approval process was already slow. The closing of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau -- the agency that oversees brewery licensing -- brought it to a standstill. For 35 days no applications could be processed, delaying the opening of breweries nationwide. The resulting backlog caused still more delays.
That year also saw the imposition of federal trade tariffs. Tariffs on steel affected the cost of stainless-steel tanks and brewing equipment, making an already great expense even greater. The crew's fermentation tanks were shipped early to beat the tariffs, but then sat in the alley for a year while construction continued. They were not as lucky with the brewhouse.
By June 2019, the group was eyeing a November opening. But plans for an outdoor patio caused zoning and permitting issues with the city of Minneapolis that added another six-month delay. "We went into this thinking, 'Oh, it was a brewery before. This will be smooth sailing,' " Voeltz said. "Not with the city of Minneapolis."
That delay brought them face to face with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Even more delays
With construction underway, Arbeiter was looking at a 14- to 16-week timeline for completion. The emergency shutdown measures imposed by Gov. Tim Walz that March threw a wrench in the process. Contractors were only allowed six people in the space at once, leading to delays and backups as subcontractors waited for work to progress to a point that they could complete their own tasks. "All in all, that probably caused us another five months in delays right there," Choi said.
"The kind of humorous aspect of it all," Blomberg said, "is that every time something bad happens we're like, 'Oh, man, we have to deal with a government shutdown. It can't get any worse. It's a tariff. It can't get any worse.' That's the joke. It continued to get worse. 'Nothing can be worse than the pandemic.' And then …"
On May 25, the police killing of George Floyd threw the Twin Cities and the nation into turmoil. Arbeiter's location, just 100 yards south of the Third Precinct police station, put them in the thick of things.
"We definitely were there for that full week," Choi said. "We got to see a lot of things. A lot of unsettling things, as well. We were up on the roof a lot and had a bird's-eye view of a lot of things. That gave us a unique perspective of just a lot of the anger that was going on and a lot of the hurt that people were feeling. I know us being so close to it, it affected us."
The crew pitched in as they could, helping neighboring businesses board up. At one point their patio served as a temporary first-aid station, with car headlights providing light.
Their building survived, but even that was emotionally fraught. "We also felt a little bit of survivor's guilt," Blomberg said. "As the dust settled and we looked around the neighborhood, we kind of felt terrible. Why is our building still here and not other places?"
It took more than three weeks after the unrest for the first contractors to return to the building. Meanwhile, the pandemic was still affecting how city government functioned, leading to further delays in the approval of their liquor license. A planned October opening was pushed into November.
By mid-November, things were looking up. With construction complete and beer in production, they began preparations to open the taproom. "We brought in a small segment of our employees for the first time on the day that Gov. Walz announced the four-week pause," Choi said. "Toward the end of their shift we actually said, 'Let's tune in and see what he has to say.' "

What's on tap
Arbeiter's plan was always to be taproom-focused; starting with retail sales in stores was a forced pivot. The taproom is spacious and modern. It's separated into distinct sections, each with a different feel -- bustling beer hall, lounge, pinball and games, and an upstairs mezzanine with a quieter feel and a bird's-eye view.
The initial beers released in crowler cans are focused mostly on low-alcohol, drinkable, traditional German styles appropriate to the brewery's name. (Arbeiter means "worker" in German.) A wider range of beers is planned, from stronger beers to sours and hazy IPAs. One focus for head brewer Aaron Herman will be bringing together New World styles with Old World ingredients, including new hop varieties from Germany.
An example of this is Sucker Punch IPL. This hop-forward lager beer features assertive bitterness and bold tangerine and melon hop flavors resting on a soft bed of bready malt. It goes out with a crisp, clean, lager finish.
One of my favorites is WinterZeit, a festbier-style lager. This balanced beer leans slightly toward bready malt with a light background note of honey. The hop flavor is intense. It pops with herbal and lemon curd/lemon peel character from one of those newer German hop varieties.
There aren't many examples of schwarzbier, a black lager style originating in the Franconia region of Bavaria, available in the Twin Cities. But Arbeiter's Nacht Rider offers an excellent option. It's nearly black, but the roasted malt character is very light, expressing as cocoa and bitter chocolate.
I love pilsners and I'm always happy when a local brewery makes a good one. Arbeiter's Haha Pils is just that. Herbal, floral and lemony hop flavors lead the way with assertive bitterness in support. A bit of malt sweetness lends some balance without getting in the way. It goes out crisp and dry as a good pilsner should.

New push to reopen Floyd site in Mpls.: Crime a growing concern, city considers next move on "George Floyd Square."

Full text: Minneapolis officials are facing renewed pressure to reopen the intersection where George Floyd was killed after two people were shot there last month, and police raised concerns that the crime scene had been compromised.
But city leaders are struggling to come to agreement on how they should reopen it. Council President Lisa Bender declined to sign on to a letter that Mayor Jacob Frey and the two council members who represent the area hoped would show unified support for reopening 38th Street and Chicago Avenue.
On Dec. 27, Minneapolis police received a report that a man and a woman had been shot near the intersection, often referred to as George Floyd Square.
When officers arrived, police said they couldn't tell where the shooting happened or find shell casings or other evidence.
"Evidence was removed, and no one would give us the evidence," said John Elder, a spokesman for the department.
"I can tell you that the chief is concerned about this remaining closed and any public safety impacts," he said.
Since Floyd died in May, the intersection has become a gathering place for people seeking to pay tribute to him, as well as a flash point for concern over rising crime in Minneapolis.
City Council members Andrea Jenkins and Alondra Cano, who represent the area, say they hope the city will reopen the space soon, and in a way that honors Floyd and acknowledges the impact of racism on Minneapolis.
Jenkins said she believes it's time for the city to begin healing from the "tragic wound that is in the psyche of almost every person in the world."
"The longer we leave that wound open, the pain, the division, they continue to persist," she said.
Cano said she hears regularly from residents and business owners who fear for their safety as crime has risen after Floyd's death and the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Some residents have reported finding bullet holes in their homes for the first time or being so concerned for their safety that they now require medication to sleep. Police say they haven't been able to pinpoint who is behind the overall increase in violence.
An online survey posted by the city -- and open to anyone -- drew more than 900 responses, and 65% of the people said they supported reopening the space in some form. About 19% said they believed the area should remain closed indefinitely. That sentiment has been shared by some people who live near the intersection and who credit demonstrators with holding peaceful events, such as movie nights and block parties that foster a sense of community.
Demonstrators have occupied the intersection since Floyd's death and some have said they don't intend to leave until the city meets a long list of demands, including requests to provide funding for anti-racism training, temporarily suspending property taxes in the area, and providing funding for businesses operated by people of color. Marcia Howard, who has helped lead some of the work at the intersection, declined to comment for this story.
City officials have met with demonstrators repeatedly over the past several months. They note that the city has designated about $10.5 million for programs in and around the intersection and is researching ways it can promote racial reconciliation. Some of the requests, though, would require changes at other levels of government.
The city announced plans to begin opening the intersection in August but postponed the effort, avoiding a confrontation. In the months since, Cano, Jenkins and Mayor Frey have sent two letters to demonstrators, outlining their thoughts on their demands.
Late last year, around the same time they were consumed in intense budget negotiations, the city drafted a letter outlining its intent to remove barricades and reconnect roads in a matter of weeks. It expressed a hope that the demonstrators would support their efforts.
Cano said they hoped to get the entire council and mayor to put their names on the letter but "we sort of hit a wall with that, because we couldn't get all 13 council members to sign on to the letter."
The city didn't send the letter. Bender, who didn't sign it, said this week that she believes decisions about the intersection should go through a formal council process, if they want all of the elected leaders to weigh in.
"I agree with the goal of reaching a mutually agreed upon timeline for any reopening and am concerned that trying to forcefully remove people from the intersection would backfire and create more conflict and difficulty for the neighbors and the City," she said in an e-mail.
City leaders are now trying to figure out the best path forward. Frey said he will support Jenkins, Cano and efforts to reopen the intersection. "Clearly, we need a decision," he said.
Some in City Hall have questioned whether they need elected officials to sign off on plans for the intersection at all.
"Honestly, Public Works probably does have the authority to move forward on their own," Jenkins said. "However, we recognize this is much more than an infrastructure situation. This is very much a situation that is created by and must respond to the social justice issues of our time."

Activists push for tougher police accountability: Bill approved last July seen by many as falling short of major change.

Full text: Civil rights organizers were back at Minnesota's Capitol as a new legislative session got underway Tuesday, ready to mount another push for changes to police accountability laws less than a week after another fatal police shooting in Minneapolis.
"We know that George Floyd is not an anomaly," said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "George Floyd represents the history of state violence against people of color in this country and particularly against Black people."
Floyd's death last May in the custody of Minneapolis police officers made Minnesota ground zero for the debate over police brutality, Hussein said, and should compel state policymakers to be at the front of the pack when it comes to legislative reform.
In July, the Legislature approved a bill that restricted police use of chokeholds, banned warrior style training and requires officers to intervene when another officer is using excessive force.
Though hailed as a bipartisan victory, some activists felt the bill fell far short of truly substantive change.
Items remaining on wish lists for civil rights groups include a longer statute of limitations for prosecuting wrongful death, more than the current three years; a statewide ban on no-knock warrants that allow law enforcement to enter private residences without knocking; tougher limits on use of force by police; access within 48 hours for families to footage of law enforcement incidents that end in death; and the creation of an independent agency to investigate criminal misconduct, made up of retired attorneys and citizens.
Speakers at the Capitol event called on two leading Senate Republicans, Majority Leader Paul Gazelka and Judiciary Chairman Warren Limmer, to take action in the coming weeks. Limmer has described police reform as an area of unfinished business but has also encouraged advocates to be patient. Last month, he told the Star Tribune that dramatic policy changes may need to take a back seat to a new statewide budget.
Gazelka and Limmer did not respond on Tuesday to requests for comment on the wish list put forward.
There is renewed attention around the push for accountability measures following last week's fatal shooting of Dolal Idd by Minneapolis police after police say he fired a gun at them.
Idd's father, Bayle Adod Gelle, was at Tuesday's Capitol news conference. He said he has many questions related to the killing of his son that have not been answered.
"He was my son. The police killed him because he was a Black boy," Gelle said.
Civil rights lawyer and activist Nekima Levy-Armstrong said that she believes change is possible.
"It's not that they can't change the system of policing, it's that they won't change the system of policing," Levy-Armstrong said.

Hundreds protest police shooting: March held day after release of search video of Idd's family home.

Full text: As many as 1,000 protesters took to the snow-covered streets of south Minneapolis on Sunday to demand justice for 23-year-old Dolal Idd after he was fatally shot by Minneapolis police last week.
The crowd was peaceful while expressing outrage over the killing that closed out 2020 -- the first by Minneapolis police since the killing of George Floyd on May 25.
For several hours Sunday, protesters listened to activists, chanted and marched from the site of the incident to Lake Street and back, carrying signs echoing those seen throughout the summer.
"I'm encouraged to see that there's such a huge turnout in solidarity for the brother and his family in the middle of the winter. That shows that there's actually passion for the youth to really actually engage this indefinitely until there is some real change," said AJ Awed, 30, who knelt on his jacket in prayer on the edge of the crowd.
"But at the same time, I'm disappointed because we shouldn't be here. After the murder of George Floyd and countless others, I don't understand how the police could be so careless, you know?"
Idd was killed Wednesday by officers during an attempted felony traffic stop at a Holiday gas station at 36th Street and Cedar Avenue in south Minneapolis. Police say Idd was being sought in connection with a weapons investigation. Police Chief Medaria Arradondo released the officers' body camera video, which appears to show that Idd fired first.
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which helped organize the protest, told Sunday's crowd that, in the wake of Floyd's death, he doesn't believe the narrative of police and called for an independent investigation. He said the first bodycam footage shared by Minneapolis police is "inconclusive" and criticized it for being edited.
The demonstration came a day after the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office released bodycam footage of a search at the Idd family home in Eden Prairie, where Dolal lived. The 28-minute video shows Idd's family, including at least two children, held on the living room floor while Idd's parents are restrained in plastic handcuffs as deputies executed a search warrant at 2:20 a.m. Dec. 31, hours after the killing.
"They had the audacity to share another edited video of how they terrorized a family ... treated them as they were going into a military operation," Hussein said.
The Sheriff's Office footage shows deputies, several with guns drawn, conducting a "knock and announce" search. At the time, Idd's family members did not know about the killing and repeatedly asked why deputies were there.
The family and others, including state Sen.-elect Omar Fateh, allege that the search was inappropriate.
Sheriff David Hutchinson said Saturday that he released the video to "clarify" what happened, saying there had been allegations that deputies acted "inappropriately, inhumanely, and with excessive force."
He said deputies assisted the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and that county SWAT officers were used because of "probable cause to believe guns were in the home."
On Sunday, protesters gathered outside the gas station at 36th and Cedar about 2 p.m. before heading north on Cedar to Lake Street. The crowd at times stopped traffic and snaked around idling cars and a Metro Transit bus. It eventually moved west on Lake before heading onto Bloomington Avenue and back to the shooting scene. The crowd began to disperse about 5 p.m.
"We need justice, that's all we need," said 32-year-old Kamas Hassan while holding a megaphone and leading chants. A nearby drum line kept a steady beat as the crowd shouted that Black and Somali lives matter.
Kari Waderich, 34, watched the crowd go by her house. She said she didn't realize a protest was planned but stepped outside to be part of the moment.
"This neighborhood has been through a lot," she said. A hand-painted Black Lives Matter sign -- from a protest she attended this summer after Floyd's death -- hung in her front window. "I don't think I'll be taking it down anytime soon."

2021 SESSION PREVIEW: AN OCCASIONAL SERIES ABOUT THE KEY PLAYERS: WALZ ADVISER IS 'CALM IN STORM' ; ROCHESTER NATIVE TAKES LOW-PROFILE APPROACH TO HIGH-PROFILE JOB.

Full text: Word of Minnesota's first COVID-19 death had made its way to Gov. Tim Walz, and the voice on the other end of the phone was a familiar if not reassuring one.
"Governor, we knew this day was going to come," Chris Schmitter told his boss in late March.
The news was all bad. But it was Schmitter's job, as Walz's chief of staff, to give him the unvarnished state of affairs. Recalling the conversation recently, Walz said in that moment, Schmitter understood "how big this was going to get."
For more than 15 years, Schmitter has been a quiet, guiding force as Walz has risen to the pinnacle of political power in Minnesota. The 36-year-old Rochester native advised the former football coach and schoolteacher during his first campaign for Congress in 2006, and does so now in the executive suite in St. Paul.
Schmitter has taken a low-profile approach to a high-profile job, dominated this year by the state's response to the pandemic and civil unrest that broke out in Minneapolis and St. Paul in the wake of George Floyd's killing. Now Schmitter must help guide the Democratic governor through the 2021 legislative session, which starts Tuesday and will set the tone for the second half of Walz's first term -- and set the table for his 2022 re-election bid.
"He's the chief problem solver," said Charlie Weaver, executive director of the Minnesota Business Partnership, who held the same job under former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty. "The most effective chiefs of staff are the ones you never hear about. You do not want to be in the news. That's not your job. Your job is to make sure the governor looks good."
Even before the pandemic hit, it was considered one of the hardest jobs in state government -- but also among the most powerful. The chief manages the governor's core staff, along with two dozen Cabinet members who oversee the 40,000-employee state workforce.
Amid the daily demands, Schmitter keeps a strategic eye toward the long-term promises Walz made to pump resources into classrooms, transportation and equity.
"If you're not thinking about how you're driving toward progress on the key issues and priorities that matter, regardless of what else is happening, then four years or eight years can pass you by before you know it," Schmitter said on a recent weekday, taking a break from a string of meetings that typically start around 4 or 5 a.m. "The job, at its core, is constantly balancing the proactive and the reactive."
The son of a nurse and a pastor with no political connections, Schmitter's trajectory wasn't a given. But his mother and his maternal grandfather were hard-core Democrats who liked to talk politics at the dinner table.
By the time he was in high school, Schmitter was organizing classmates to knock on doors for DFL candidates in southern Minnesota. He went off to Georgetown University to study international politics but took a semester off in 2004 to volunteer for John Kerry's presidential campaign back home in Minnesota.
That's when he first crossed paths with Walz, a geography teacher in Mankato who was upset when a student was turned away from a George W. Bush event for wearing a Kerry sticker. Schmitter met Walz at his home to go over what had happened.
The two hit it off, and it wasn't long before Walz, a political novice, was turning to young Schmitter for help on his run for the First Congressional District seat in 2006. Walz won, and Schmitter spent several years helping Walz set up and run his congressional office in D.C. and back home.
Schmitter stepped away from politics in 2010 to attend law school at the University of Minnesota. He clerked for John Tunheim, chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Minnesota, where he pored over huge amounts of case material. Sometimes, Tunheim asked his clerks to summarize and recommend an outcome.
"That's outstanding legal training for the kind of position he has now," Tunheim said. "It really is the center of the wheel. The governor makes the critical decisions for the state, but you've got a chief of staff who it's all running through first."
Walz hired Schmitter as his chief of staff the night he won the 2018 election. It was his first political appointment as governor-elect, but not a surprising one to those who have watched Schmitter and Walz work together over the years.
"We've known each other so long that there's just this understanding and trust there. He can push back," Walz said. "He can say to me, 'Governor, if this is where you choose to go, this is what's going to come your way.' "
Political chops Schmitter developed in Washington became essential to working with a divided Minnesota House and Senate. They managed to strike a budget deal in their first session in 2019.
"It's hard to state the importance of getting that first budget done in terms of setting the tone," said Myron Frans, Walz's former budget commissioner. "It could have so easily gone sideways."
Schmitter's role unexpectedly and dramatically shifted after the pandemic hit. Suddenly, he went from running a political office to a pandemic response, managing the flow of information about COVID-19 cases, the supply of personal protective equipment and testing capacity.
He advised Walz as cases spiked and the governor had to take unprecedented steps to close businesses and order people to stay home.
"I'm not sure when [Chris] sleeps," said Andrea Walsh, president and CEO of HealthPartners, who worked with Schmitter and the governor's office to launch a "moonshot" COVID-19 testing plan early in the pandemic. "I've tended to be on the phone with him early in the morning and then again late in the evening. He really has a lot of bandwidth."
Then in May, a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd, killing him and sparking weeks of civil unrest in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Schmitter helped set up a command center to respond.
"Chris is very much the calm in the storm," said Maggie Gau, the chief of staff to Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers. She consulted Schmitter when unrest hit Kenosha in August following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. "He is very even keeled."
The biggest challenge for Schmitter, especially now, is keeping Walz's long-term goals moving ahead as the 2021 legislative session kicks off Tuesday. This time, the governor and legislators are confronting a possible $1.3 billion deficit triggered by the pandemic.
The positive relationships Walz and his team built with legislators in both parties in his first year in office are now strained by his use of executive powers to respond to the pandemic.
Republicans in control of the Senate knocked out two of his commissioners during special sessions in the summer and fall. Groups filed lawsuits and attempted a recall.
More immediately, Walz said he's leaned on Schmitter to help prioritize schools and allow them to open in January, all while the state has started to distribute tens of thousands of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Still, Schmitter keeps those long-term campaign goals front of mind.
"You're only guaranteed four years," he said. "You cannot waste a second."

Full text: It could almost go without saying that one of the first things we can't wait to do in a post-COVID world is be seated -- maskless and carefree -- at a table, with four solid walls surrounding us.
Who would have imagined a year ago that we'd long for something as basic and integral to restaurants as the ability to eat inside of one?
We don't know when that wish will come true, but 2021 is looking promising. In the meantime, here's what the Taste team is waiting (and hoping) to see in the new year.
Sizzling debuts
Even amid a pandemic, big names are taking even bigger chances on new restaurants. Look for Sean Sherman's Owamni by the Sioux Chef, Karyn Tomlinson's Myriel, Ann Kim's Sooki & Mimi, Yia Vang's Vinai, Houston White and Dogwood's Get Down Coffee Co., the Schram team's AxeBridge winery, the Rand Tower Club, a distillery from the Earl Giles team, the Market at Malcolm Yards food hall and the Fair on 4, the Mall of America's latest eatertainment venue.
Downtown destination
Will 2021 be the year that the Dayton's Project -- the $200 million remake of what was once the city's largest department store -- is finally opened to the public? Here's hoping. A key component of the mammoth undertaking is a basement-level food hall, accessed via a new three-story atrium and featuring up to 55 vendors. This post-pandemic people magnet should help restore 700 Nicollet to its rightful place as the beating heart of downtown Minneapolis. Another promising amenity is a makers' market. The first-floor retail incubator will showcase up-and-coming vendors; hopefully that includes a place for Minnesota-made food products.
Equity for all
The impact was instant. The start of the pandemic brought crushing unemployment to the hospitality industry, and revealed just how close to the edge many workers were already living. Then, the police killing of George Floyd sparked global conversations about equality and racial justice that extended to almost every aspect of daily life. In the food world, from kitchens to magazine editors' suites, those conversations lifted the veil on the disparities and indignities shouldered by many workers in the hospitality industry, especially Black people, Indigenous people and people of color. What could equity look like in 2021? That the people working to bring us food are taken care of: Living wages, health insurance and unfettered access to opportunity are all a good start.
More ghost kitchens
We got pizza, burgers, tacos and a whole lot of fried-chicken sandwiches from new takeout-only restaurants-within-restaurants, known as ghost kitchens. The phrase "virtual food hall" is now a thing. Ghost kitchens emerged from their shroud of mystery and have become part of the dining lexicon. They've proven to be a smart way for restaurants to diversify and find new revenue, while chefs get to flex their culinary muscles with totally new menus. And customers get to try it all. First up in January: Viva Cubano, a new gourmet sandwich setup operating from St. Paul's French Hen Cafe.
Comebacks
When Surly Brewing Co. owner Omar Ansari shuttered his massive beer hall and pizzeria in November, he (thankfully) invoked the word "indefinitely." Fingers crossed that a post-COVID world includes a revitalized Surly.
Grand Cafe chef/owner Jamie Malone exited her contemporary French restaurant in November. Malone, a two-time James Beard nominee, continues to create (appropriately named) Keep it Grand meal kits from her downtown Minneapolis restaurant, Eastside. She's also promising a new iteration of the Grand, and we can only hope that this new brick-and-mortar setup -- one that's as seductively charming as its predecessor -- materializes in 2021.
Also on the wish list: a sooner-rather-than-later end to the hiatus at Breaking Bread Cafe. And three cheers to the news that Midori's Floating World Cafe (closed since the restaurant was heavily damaged in the riots following the killing of George Floyd) has started a takeout pop-up at the Seward Cafe.
The great outdoors
If there was ever a time to get Minnesotans to embrace winter, it's 2021, when we will be living our best lives in the great outdoors. Thankfully, a few sterling examples of the Bold North aesthetic are popping up as role models. Mill Valley Market in Theodore Wirth Park is going all in on its year-round outdoor commitment to a patio packed with heaters and five wood-burning fire pits. On weekends, the ultra-charming biergarten at Waldmann Brewery & Wurstery is maximizing winter enjoyment, complete with beer and food service (yes, you should order the spaetzle) and lots of heaters. And in the North Loop, the roomy patio at lobster-centric Smack Shack sports a slick overhead infrared heating system. More kudos to the farmers markets -- Mill City, Northeast, Fulton, St. Paul and Minneapolis -- that are staging outdoor formats. Residents of Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo and other cold-climate cities celebrate their winter weather and dine outdoors; isn't it time that we finally follow their lead?
Hearing, helping each other
On a different kind of cold-weather note, we should all be doing more than wishing that Twin Cities restaurants successfully navigate the perilous winter months that lie ahead. Next time you order takeout, ask your server/chef/restaurateur how they're doing, what their restaurant needs in order to survive and how you can help.
Cocktails everywhere
More people turned to liquor stores as bars were off-limits for most of the year, and local distilleries met the moment by releasing shelf-stable cocktails at a steady clip. And they're great. But the magic of a drink mixed by an expert bartender and served seconds later? That's reserved for a seat at the bar, something we can't wait to get back into in 2021. As a consolation prize, we'd accept full-strength cocktails with takeout.
Creativity galore
Curbside pickup. Subscriptions. The aforementioned ghost kitchens. Provision markets. The hospitality industry was constantly reinventing itself in 2020 out of necessity, and customers went along for the ride. The reasons behind such innovations are lamentable; this year was all about survival. At the same time, diners were introduced to exciting new ways to enjoy good food. We can't wait to see what daring, mold-breaking concepts stick around, and what surprises are yet to come.
Getting serious in the suburbs
It was very good news when Revival owners Thomas Boemer and Nick Rancone announced plans to open an outpost of their fried-chicken-focused operation in St. Louis Park. Ditto the announcement that former Bachelor Farmer chef Jonathan Gans is helping launch Churchill Street in Shoreview. The vast majority of Twin Citians are suburbanites. Logic follows that these communities should be crawling with independently owned restaurants, but they're not. Perhaps this year will spark a surge in suburban dining options of the non-chain variety.
Adding voices
Two vital Twin Cities food-and-drink media platforms were extinguished in 2020: City Pages and the Growler. But it's not all bad news. After a two-year hiatus, James Norton, the Growler's food editor, revived Heavy Table (heavytable.com), his insightful and lively online magazine and newsletter. And thoughtful, high-style Meal Magazine (meal-magazine.com), which debuted last spring, is coming out with its second edition in January. Perhaps it's the start of a new wave of coverage, because the more that people are publishing, broadcasting and podcasting about restaurants, food, libations, farming, baking, brewing and distilling, the better.
The return of the State Fair
The drive-through food parade was fun, but we'd prefer ordering our bucket of cookies on foot next year.

Full text: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 1/2/2021: This story misspelled Minneapolis resident Mary Mochinski's name. CORRECTION PUBLISHED 1/6/2021: This story misspelled the last name of officer Jason Schmitt. New video released by the Minneapolis Police Department shows that a 23-year-old man fired first before he was shot and killed by police officers during an attempted traffic stop Wednesday evening.
The footage from body cameras that officers wear appears to confirm the account of the encounter given by authorities amid forceful but peaceful demonstrations and calls for more transparency in the death of Dolal Idd.
Police Chief Medaria Arradondo released the footage at a news conference Thursday in what he called a demonstration of the department's commitment to transparency. But, he said, while the case is being investigated, the body camera footage showed that officers only fired after being fired upon.
"Clearly, at least from my view of the video … my officers were reacting to that deadly threat," Arradondo told reporters. "The investigation will uncover more details, but if the question is should the officers not react in a deadly force situation and knowing that community members' lives are at stake as well, the officers are trained to protect community members' lives and their own."
An autopsy found that Idd, of Eden Prairie, was shot multiple times and pronounced dead at the scene. Police say he was being sought in connection with a weapons investigation but otherwise gave few details about the events leading up to the shooting, citing the ongoing state probe. Still, the shooting added to the edginess of a city still reeling from the police killing of George Floyd in May and the unrest that ensued.
The footage spread quickly on social media, where some criticized the aggressiveness with which officers initially confronted Idd. Others questioned why the department had in the past waited weeks, if not months, to release footage from controversial shootings.
Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said the 27-second video was "inconclusive" and called for more transparency.
The clip posted to the city's website Thursday afternoon shows the chaotic moments leading up to the 6:15 p.m. shooting at the Holiday gas station at 36th Street and Cedar Avenue in south Minneapolis.
As three Minneapolis police squads with flashing lights converged on him, Idd threw his car into reverse and tried to flee the parking lot. He turned to drive away, but two of the squads blocked his path and an officer approached on foot, gun drawn. The unidentified officer then pointed a gun for the driver to "stop your car," identifying himself as police and instructing Idd to put his "hands up!"
Idd ignored repeated police commands to get out of his car before he pulled out a handgun and shot through the rolled up window, shattering the glass, the footage shows. Officers fired more than a dozen rounds into his car as the clip abruptly ended.
Idd's death was the 83rd homicide of the year. It was also the first police killing in Minneapolis since the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of four since-fired officers.
Floyd's death spurred protests and rioting that spread nationwide and prompted an intense, often bitter debate about the future of the Minneapolis Police Department.
Hours after the video's release Thursday, several dozen people attended a vigil for Idd and other victims of police violence.
As the vigil turned to a march, Mary Moschinski looked on and wondered aloud, "Did they watch the same video I did?
"It looks to me those cops were doing their jobs," she said. "I marched in the protests when George Floyd was murdered. This is not the same."
Sources identified the officers who discharged their weapons as Darcy Klund, Paul Huynh and Jason Schmidt. All three have been placed on standard administrative leave.
Klund, a former longtime homicide detective who is married to a Hennepin County judge, now runs the First Precinct Community Response Team, which was leading the investigation of Idd. He was one of several city officers who signed a public letter this summer condemning the killing of Floyd and committing to working with the community "to regain your trust."
Minneapolis-based attorney Aaron Morrison, who is representing the officers involved, declined to comment when reached on Thursday.
Community Response Teams, or CRTs, police quality of life issues, such as drugs and other street-level crimes. These teams investigate "crime patterns, such as the recent spate of car jackings in Minneapolis," said police spokesman John Elder.
Police say the officers pulled the car over for a "felony stop," language that could be key to the investigation by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). The term implies the person was suspected -- but not convicted -- of a felony-level crime, and Minneapolis police policy cites deadly force may be authorized to stop a suspect "whom the peace officer knows or has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or attempted to commit a felony and the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or great bodily harm to another person under the threat criteria in clause."
The quick move to release footage marked a departure from past processes when officials waited weeks, sometimes months, to disclose video of a police killing.
City Attorney Jim Rowader called the release of the single video an "extraordinary step" toward transparency, although other videos and further information will be "strictly limited" while the investigation continues.
Arradondo said he met with Idd's father and showed him the body camera footage before its release. He renewed calls for peaceful protests in the city.
Idd was first identified by his father, Bayle Gelle, of Eden Prairie, after he arrived at the gas station Thursday morning with several supporters.
Gelle said BCA agents arrived at his home Wednesday after his son was killed, said they had a search warrant and detained the residents.
"The police they are brutality. I want to get justice," he said. "... They was pushing us around and screaming. ... They have big guns."
Gelle did not elaborate on why police searched the home, but CAIR-MN and other groups condemned the police action.
"According to the family of the deceased, the police entered their home late last night. They were handcuffed and had their house searched, and they were only informed of their son and brother's death at the end of this encounter," said state Sen.-elect Omar Fateh. "This type of treatment for a bereaved family is inhumane and unconscionable."
In 2019, Idd was convicted of illegally possessing and firing a gun in Hennepin County. The charges say that in July 2018, Idd fired a gun in the basement shower of his parents' home around 1 a.m. with two children sleeping nearby.
Idd's mother told Eden Prairie police that her son was not permitted in the house because "he scares the children." Police arrested him later in Bloomington with a 9mm handgun that had been reported stolen in North Dakota, according to charges.
On Thursday, authorities braced for the kind of unrest that wracked the city this spring, but none materialized.
Regardless of what the body camera video shows, "it doesn't mitigate any trauma we will experience from watching," said Alicia Smith, who runs the Corcoran Neighborhood Organization.
At the time of the shooting, Smith was shoveling the sidewalk outside the group's headquarters, about a block north of the Holiday. She ducked inside upon hearing the gunfire. She says she then went home and only learned of the shooting when she returned to the scene a few hours later.
Carmen Means said many Blacks have long harbored an innate distrust of the criminal justice system, fueled by past abuses and decades of overly aggressive policing tactics in minority neighborhoods.
"I think the challenge is that we don't know -- we're often given the same narrative from MPD," said Means, a pastor and executive director of the Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization. "We're talking about a community that's been really traumatized, we're talking about a community that's hurting."
That mistrust has only deepened after incidents in which police take armed white suspects into custody without shooting them, said Shanene Herbert, healing justice program director of the American Friends Service Committee, an organization devoted to social justice causes.
When, she asked, will the system "honor a Black person's humanity?"
Adriana Mota and Silvia Landaverde were finishing some work in the law firm De Le³n, Nestor & Torres on Wednesday night when they heard a loud series of noises that Mota initially mistook for a car with a noisy muffler. Landaverde recognized them as gunshots and told Mota to duck.
They saw several people in the parking lot apparently scrambling for cover, they said.
Harold Moses has lived near the Holiday for 28 years and said he heard about a dozen gunshots.
Moses, a Black single father of two, said Wednesday night that he assumed the victim was Black. After George Floyd was killed he stopped allowing his 15-year-old son, who is part Filipino, to go jogging in the neighborhood because of concerns about safety.
"Nothing seems to change -- policing and people's attitudes," he said.

Prosecutors seek Floyd trial delay: Citing the coronavirus, they now say proceeding should wait until June 7.

Full text: Prosecutors in the case against the four officers charged in the death of George Floyd requested that the trial be delayed by three months, citing the COVID-19 pandemic and the amount of time needed before enough people are vaccinated and health risks are sufficiently diminished.
March 8 has been the date for the trial to start before Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill for the now-fired police officers charged in connection with the death of Floyd on May 25 while he was forcibly detained on a south Minneapolis street corner.
In its motion, the prosecution argued that putting off the trial until June 7 "appropriately balances the need to protect public health with the need to ensure that this case is resolved expeditiously."
Waiting until then, the motion continued, "would substantially reduce the risks to trial participants from COVID-19, and thereby reduce the risk that this trial is delayed or disrupted by a COVID-19 outbreak among the trial participants."
Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are scheduled to be tried together. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, and the others are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, earlier this month made a motion for a delay in the trial for what he alleged was the mishandling by prosecutors of how they share evidence with the defense -- including burying important information in the midst of
irrelevant material, providing duplicates of the same item and turning over thousands of pages of unrelated documents.
Nelson said he has no intention of objecting to the prosecution seeking a delay in the trial.
Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, said the prosecution's motion pointing to COVID-19 left him puzzled.
"The timing of their motion seems curious to me," he said. "The pandemic has been around for a while."
Thao's lawyer, Robert Paule, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The prosecution backed its motion with an affidavit filed with the court by Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a member of President-elect Joe Biden's COVID-19 advisory board.
Emanuel points out on behalf of the motion that "millions of Americans in the general population [are likely to] receive a COVID-19 vaccination between March 2021 and June 2021." As a result, the doctor reasoned, "large public gatherings -- including those conducted with proper social distancing and mask protocols -- will be substantially safer in June 2021."
The doctor went on to contend that the sheer number of participants in the Floyd trial and those actively interested in the proceedings combine to create a health risk that need not be taken by holding firm to a March 8 start date.
"An in-person trial in March 2021 that attracts a large number of people who are indoors for prolonged periods of time with public speaking is likely to create a substantial risk of COVID-19 transmission [and] could even become a super-spreader event," Emanuel said.
Earl Gray, who is defending Lane, filed an objection to putting off the trial beyond March, contending that "the State and/or its expert, although all powerful, cannot see into the future" in terms of the threat posed by the coronavirus.
The prosecutors in their filing noted that "the high-profile nature of this case -- as well as the larger-than-usual number of trial participants, including four Defendants, their counsel, and dozens of witnesses -- could mean that many people will congregate in and around the Hennepin County Government Center during trial, thereby posing a higher threat of COVID-19 transmission than the typical criminal trial in Hennepin County."
Peter Wold, a Twin Cities defense attorney who is not involved in this case, said he expects Cahill to grant the prosecution's request.
"With the vaccination process going so slowly, having a trial in March for a month -- or however long it's going to take -- the odds of one or multiple people coming down with COVID are pretty high," said Wold. "That would be a disaster for everyone."
Wold, who represented Mohamed Noor, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of third-degree murder in the 2017 shooting death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, said "it's really hard to imagine" Cahill blocking a delay.
"Who wants to be responsible for pushing a trial forward and then [someone] gets afflicted with COVID?" he said.
