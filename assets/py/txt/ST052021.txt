Full text: HOUSTON - She wondered what the children knew.
Kimberly Hewitt noticed them playing outside Cuney Homes when she arrived on the anniversary of George Floyd's killing and feared the deaths of Black people were starting to seem too normal.
She did not want young people here to think an early death was their fate, too.
Hewitt and several dozen well-wishers prayed. They recited Floyd's name and released a panoply of red and gold balloons into the sky. Yet the mourning was hardly over.
Floyd was only one in a cascade of neighborhood men to die lately, and they had another funeral to attend.
For days, the usual crowd had been fading around the intersection of Winburn and Tierwester Streets near where Floyd spent much of his life.
Some declined to give interviews about him, saying they were too upset that Christopher Hutchins -- a childhood friend of Floyd's -- was gunned down on the freeway May 17.
The Sunday after it happened, Hewitt came out to the corner and turned up the gospel music of Kirk Franklin outside her food stand, the Brunch Box. Joyful lyrics danced down the empty streets.
Put your hands together! Put your hands together! It did little to lift Hewitt's spirits as she mixed her waffle batter.
They had both grown up with Floyd in Cuney Homes, known as "the Bricks," Houston's oldest public housing project. She opened the Brunch Box across the street several years ago and joined a program to train Black entrepreneurs. Hewitt hoped she could expand one day and create jobs and charitable programs for her community.
Many of her customers knew Floyd, and his sister and niece occasionally stopped by for margaritas. As Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer last May spurred a global movement against racism, Hewitt and Hutchins marched for justice. Floyd's friend Milton "Poboy" Carney brought signs for her to put outside the Brunch Box: "Black Lives Matter" and "Justice for George Floyd."
Over the months, Hewitt noticed that they always held firm in the ground, even as the rain and winds swept over tents and other decorations.
She figured it was Floyd's way of saying he wasn't going anywhere. She vowed that neither would she.
Then somebody called Hewitt last November and told her that her son was dead.
***
"Dietrich! Dietrich! Dietrich!"
She threw herself to the ground and screamed her son's name. A man had shot him outside a convenience store a half-mile from the Brunch Box. Hewitt already had lost one of her three sons in 2012, when someone killed him in self-defense. But to lose another? It was all the more wrenching in the wake of Floyd's death. He mentored Dietrich, as he had other local men, before leaving for Minneapolis.
Hewitt, 46, closed the Brunch Box for a month and used the profits from her fledgling business to bury her son. She had just one child living in Houston now, a 20-year-old daughter. Two other adult children had moved away.
Hewitt made sure to look happy for her customers when she reopened, even if she was only pretending.
Across the street stood Scott Food Mart, a corner store where a mural of Floyd graced the western wall. She could not see the painting from where she stood: the Brunch Box faced the south side of the store, where it had become a tradition to record the names of the local dead on the wall.
Someone wrote a poem about endangered Black men across the bricks.
***
The killings did not stop.
Floyd's friend Baby D, 25, was shot to death outside the market in February. Two weeks later came the downtown slaying of another: 31 year-old rapper Obe Noir. Better known in the neighborhood as Zay The Brick Boy, he had played professional basketball overseas but never forgot his Cuney Homes roots and spoke passionately against police brutality after Floyd's death.
Last year, he collaborated with the rapper Reconcile for a song called "Streets is Suicide" about the epidemic of shootings, filming scenes by the Floyd mural at Scott Food Mart. The opening drew from an Instagram video Floyd posted about how the next generation was so lost, going around busting out guns in crowds, killing kids.
Hutchins planned to join the events on the anniversary of Floyd's killing, and his death sent a new current of grief over Floyd's family. Floyd's brother Philonise was born the same year as Hutchins, 39, and he cried at the news.
Before moving to Minneapolis in 2017, Floyd spent his last weekend in Houston hosting a community event with Hutchins. They handed out food and set up activities for neighborhood children. Floyd was devastated from afar when a teenager killed Hutchins' 8-year-old son in a drive-by shooting the following year.
"How can Black lives matter if they don't matter to us?" said Philonise Floyd, reflecting on the local murders. "... If Black lives matter, you shouldn't kill your own people."
Hewitt views the violence devouring her neighborhood as a problem largely of Black men shooting one another. What hurts the most, she said, is "you watched your brother [Floyd] get lynched on national TV ... these youngsters running around here don't know their history, don't know anything, haven't gained knowledge from this. It's sickening."
***
They came dressed in red, black and white.
Several hundred people poured into the funeral for Hutchins in northeast Houston on Friday, three days after the gathering to honor Floyd at Cuney Homes. Poboy, the friend of Floyd's who had brought racial justice signs for the Brunch Box, hugged visitors on their way in, asking, "You all right?"
A large array of Floyd's friends paid respects: the one who commissioned the Scott Food Market mural, the Houston native who encouraged Floyd to join him in Minneapolis, the Cuney Homes resident council president who watched him and Hutchins grow up. Floyd's brothers Rodney and Philonise came, too.
"Everything's going to be okay," Philonise told those who gathered.
People said they were tired of going to funerals and seeing a new wave of RIPs on Instagram. Barely taking in one murder before reeling from the next. Looking around the parking lot, one man remarked, "A storm is coming through, taking away everybody."
Hewitt gazed at the man in the coffin, dressed in white. She had always liked Hutchins' optimism. She remembered how he took some sage from her a few weeks before and said, "Sister, let me pray with it."
From her pew, she listened as the pastor read from the Bible: "Even though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me." Women sang and cried out hallelujah!
***
Back at the Brunch Box, Hewitt tried to shake off the heaviness of the morning. She found cooking therapeutic in a way, and seasoned a half-dozen chicken wingettes, then put them in the deep fryer.
Somebody walked up and said that Zay The Brick Boy's brother was just killed. He had been a burgeoning regular at the food stand. Stunned, Hewitt called a friend to relay the news, adding, "I don't know how true it is." Some guys at the corner store confirmed that it was, indeed, true.
"That was a sweet little baby," Hewitt told a friend.
She thought of how she used to sell him the same meal she was making now. Hewitt took the chicken out of the fryer, stirred the French toast batter and splashed in cream. "Bury one and lose one," she said.
People began streaming in from the funeral, among them Floyd's friend James Walker, who worked with young men to help them survive the neighborhood's dangers. He told Hewitt he had made a call for more details on the latest victim, but nobody picked up. She sliced some French toast. "Chicken is done so it won't take nothing but a few seconds."
As he ate on the outdoor patio, Walker lamented that cops did not do enough to solve killings of Black men. With police brutality and community violence, he noted, it's all the same narrative: Nobody cares.
"Right now you're in harm's way," Walker said. "The streets and violence that goes on ... whoever [Hutchins] had some frequency with could come through here right now. It's that real."
Over the years, a series of Floyd's friends moved out of the neighborhood: to the Houston suburbs, Louisiana, Minnesota. Some still visited the intersection but departed before dark.
Hewitt, too, usually left by late afternoon. As the day waned, she felt that her community had let her down. But Hewitt knew she would keep coming back. She would not give up on the place she was from.

LONG ROAD BACK: A YEAR AFTER THE RIOTS: HEARTBREAK OF DESTRUCTION, THEN RESILIENCE

Full text: Kelly Drummer watched her organization's building go up in flames on the third night of unrest along Lake Street in Minneapolis.
The executive director of Migizi, an American Indian nonprofit providing media arts training, had spent the previous two years fundraising, renovating and settling into the new building, only to see it destroyed months after opening.
Already wearied by a global pandemic -- with her children navigating virtual school and Migizi adapting its programs for Native youth to suit COVID-19 health restrictions -- Drummer now faced a seemingly impossible task.
"With the pandemic, having to deal with distance learning and then when we lost our building to the fire, I just wanted to quit life because it felt so overwhelming," Drummer said. "I just always felt like I would be two steps ahead and end up 20 steps behind."
The pandemic exacerbated stressors that many women have long harbored: anxiety over their children's futures, the health of their families, their communities and their own careers. Pew Research suggests the pandemic didn't create these challenges but made them unmanageable for many, leading to a decline in labor force participation rates among women.
But for women who lived or worked at the heart of last summer's protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul, there was an additional, acute stress: rebuilding businesses, organizations and their neighborhood while addressing the racial and ethnic inequities exposed by the killing of George Floyd and subsequent social reckoning.
"It intersected every part of my life. Not just my job and the people I work with. It's my own very personal life that I have to deal with my own children," Drummer said.
She had the Native American community looking to her for guidance while her five children, ages 12 to 27, also struggled with the weight of this moment in their own ways. The Drummer family are members of the Black, white and American Indian communities.
After Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd -- a death captured on footage seen around the world -- Drummer recalls her youngest son, then 11, saying, Floyd "looks just like daddy."
Her son, not knowing how to fully express himself, just kept repeating, "it is bad," Drummer said, in reference to the unrest, Floyd's death and the burning of Migizi's building.
Drummer's teenage daughter, now a senior in high school, watched alongside her mother as the building caught fire from flames started at the post office and Third Precinct police station a block away.
"She was just very angry. Angry about what happened [to Migizi], but then also as a young girl of color, she understood where people were coming from," Drummer said.
Her husband, Samuel Drummer, said he will never forget the sound of his wife's voice as she tried to protect the building, calling for help that didn't come. "It was horrifying to see my wife in that level of despair," he said.
In the immediate aftermath, Drummer wasn't sure she had the fortitude to rebuild, she said. "Immediately, I was like, 'I don't want to do it and I can't,' " she said. "I didn't even know how to move. I felt stuck."
Then, donations began pouring in. Friends, colleagues and the community all helped. A group of Native American construction crews taught her how to clear the site and get bids for demolition. Others offered pro bono legal aid.
"Money is great, but you need the human and social capital," she said. "It's a heavy lift and we wouldn't have been able to do it without all these relationships."
Meanwhile, Drummer patched together temporary locations for Migizi's youth programs to meet, from people's homes to the Minneapolis American Indian Center. Drummer was working in makeshift spots around her house, struggling to find an end time to her workday.
Her husband said he will remember this year for the constant juggling his wife did, donning a baseball cap as she hustled out the door to catch one of the kids' games before plugging back in late at night to write another grant application.
"It was really, really hard. My son at the end of the summer said, 'You weren't even here,' and what he meant was I wasn't emotionally and spiritually there," Drummer said. "And looking back, I really wasn't."
Finally, this last February, Migizi bought a new building 10 blocks west on Lake Street that it plans to renovate and reopen next year.
"In the end, we've come through the ashes to a really good place," Drummer said, "but not without challenges."

National reporters sue patrol over riots: Two L.A. Times staffers say they ID'd themselves, but troopers continued assault.

Full text: Two Los Angeles Times journalists say Minnesota State Patrol troopers trapped them against a block wall and battered them with blunt projectiles, tear gas and chemical spray while they were reporting on unrest in Minneapolis following the killing of George Floyd.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday night, photographer Carolyn Cole and Houston Bureau Chief Molly Hennessy-Fiske say they were clearly identifiable as press when troopers assaulted them. Cole suffered a corneal abrasion and chemical burns on her eye and skin. A photo enclosed in the civil complaint shows Cole crouched in a brick corner, draped in camera equipment, doused in chemical liquid and screaming in agony. Hennessy-Fiske sustained multiple shots to the legs with projectiles, and the lawsuit also includes photos of her bruised and bleeding limb.
"Carolyn and Molly came to Minneapolis to cover a defining time in American history," said Andrew Noel, one of the
Minneapolis-based attorneys representing the journalists, in a statement. "They, like many members of the free press, ended up being illegally targeted by our State's highest law-enforcement agency. It's beyond shocking to see how the First and Fourth Amendments were tossed aside by the State Troopers in this case."
The Minnesota Department of Public Safety, which oversees the State Patrol, is aware of the lawsuit but hasn't been served with it yet, said spokesman Douglas Neville. Neville said the department does not comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit adds to a growing pool of allegations that law enforcement intentionally targeted law-abiding journalists during the protests and riots that engulfed Minneapolis after the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. In the two weeks that followed, more than 40 journalists were attacked, arrested or had equipment damaged in Minneapolis, according to data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing police agencies in a class-action lawsuit saying the press was "under attack" in Minneapolis in that time period.
Cole and Hennessy-Fiske traveled to Minneapolis after Floyd's killing to cover the unrest that had become a national story. On May 30, shortly after the 8 p.m. curfew took effect, they had joined a group of other reporters at E. 31st Street and Nicollet Avenue S., near the Fifth Precinct police headquarters. Cole was wearing a flak jacket emblazoned with the word "TV" and carrying a large camera and bag. Hennessy-Fiske wore a press badge around her neck and held a notebook.
The group of reporters was standing across the street from protesters, near a block wall in the parking lot of a Metro Transit garage. The legion of Minnesota State troopers moved toward them, shrouded in blue smoke, announced a curfew had taken effect and ordered crowds to disperse.
Media was granted exemption from the curfew by Gov. Tim Walz, citing the critical need for journalists to be free to safely document the events.
Cole, Hennessy-Fiske and other reporters in the group pointed out their press gear to the troopers, but the officers continued to "advance on the press group and then started firing -- spraying members of the press with pepper spray and shooting them with 40-millimeter blunt-impact projectiles," according to the civil complaint.
A trooper "intentionally" sprayed Cole in the eye, which she captured on camera, according to the lawsuit. Hennessy-Fiske was shot at least five times in the leg with projectiles and a tear-gas canister, the lawsuit says.
The heavy force sent the reporters fleeing into a block wall surrounding mechanical equipment in the parking lot, according to the lawsuit. "The press group was trapped," the lawsuit says. "They were bloodied and screaming. They were injured. They were blinded. The only way to escape the troopers was to scale the wall."
Hennessy-Fiske made it over the wall as a news crew captured her fleeing.
Cole didn't. She kept snapping pictures as she climbed on a pipe and tried to climb over, but she couldn't make it because of her heavy camera equipment. Eventually a trooper "helped" push her over. "She fell to the ground, crying, and crawled down the street -- still blinded from the pepper spray -- until somebody came to her aid," according to the lawsuit.
Cole recapped the attack in a Los Angeles Times story days later, describing that Hennessy-Fiske had yelled, "We're reporters!" and "Wait! Where do we go?" when the troopers approached. But the officers continued to move toward them, firing projectiles and chemical irritant. "I've been covering conflict both nationally and internationally for many years, so I know the dangers involved in these situations, especially when you get between riot police and protesters, but I wasn't expecting them to attack us directly," wrote Cole. Hennessy-Fiske was hit twice with rubber bullets. Another photographer had a bloody face.
Both reporters' injuries were treated in coming days and weeks. Cole, the photographer, flew home to Los Angeles and sought medical attention for eye and back injuries, according to the suit.
Hennessy-Fiske remained in Minneapolis and bandaged herself with hotel first aid supplies, the lawsuit says. She refrained from going out after curfew to cover the protests and riots.
The lawsuit alleges State Patrol Capt. Joseph Dwyer, Lt. Timothy Salto and several unidentified state troopers interfered with the reporters' constitutionally protected rights, and the use of force created a chilling effect for journalists documenting the newsworthy unrest. They allege multiple violations of their First and Fourteenth amendment rights, and that Dwyer and Salto failed in their duty as supervisors and created "an environment where indiscriminate use of force against demonstrators and the free press was allowed to occur without proper force reporting and without consequence."

Past deadline, Congress faces crunch time on police reform: Floyd family has publicly urged passage of federal policing measures.

Full text: WASHINGTON - Lawmakers on Capitol Hill continued to face a deep partisan divide over a policing overhaul package a day after blowing a deadline from President Joe Biden, who had urged Congress to pass a measure by the anniversary of George Floyd's death.
"I think it's June or bust," South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott told reporters Wednesday about the potential for a deal, adding that he feels lawmakers have "three weeks in June to get this done."
A bipartisan solution on policing legislation has eluded Congress over the past year. Members of Floyd's family renewed their push for reform legislation during a trip to Washington on Tuesday, the anniversary of Floyd's killing, meeting with leading lawmakers in between a White House visit with Biden.
Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump said the president told them "he doesn't want to sign a bill that doesn't have substance and meaning, so he is going to be patient to make sure it's the right bill, not a rushed bill."
But the divide among Minnesota's own delegation mirrors the stubborn division in Congress, with a sharp partisan split over what should happen moving forward.
"Democrats will have to recognize that this may come down to 80 percent of what we believe is important if we wish to get something done," Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday. "And that means perhaps having to wait for the final 20 percent, or settling for nothing."
Rep. Pete Stauber, a Republican, opposes Democrats' push to limit qualified immunity, which can be used to protect the liability of officers in civil legal actions. But Rep. Ilhan Omar was one of 10 Democratic lawmakers who signed a joint letter to congressional leaders last week, saying "we are concerned by recent discussions that the provision ending qualified immunity for local, state, and federal law enforcement may be removed in order to strike a bipartisan deal in the Senate."
Any major change made to win over GOP votes could risk the support of Democrats. Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, is prominently working with two Democrats, Rep. Karen Bass of California and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, on a potential path forward.
Scott and Stauber, a former Duluth police officer, sponsored their own version of police reform last year that is less far-reaching than the legislation named for George Floyd that the Democrat-controlled House passed in March. Stauber said in a statement Tuesday that he has been involved in talks on the issue with the other three lawmakers, including a meeting last week.
"The biggest sticking point during these meetings is still qualified immunity," Stauber said. "I do not support changes to qualified immunity, and I have made my position on this issue crystal clear in these meetings."
In an interview this week, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith emphasized her stance that qualified immunity should be reformed and that there should be a national use-of-force standard. But she was reluctant to get ahead of the current talks aimed at reaching a compromise.
"I'm not going to negotiate here for my friend Senator Cory Booker," Smith, a Democrat, said. "I've spoken to him about this, and I look to Senator Scott and Senator Booker to, I hope, come up with a solution that allows us to deliver this kind of accountability."
Minnesota's senior senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, struck a similar tone, saying in a statement that Booker "has been relentless in his pursuit of justice and I am hopeful that we will reach an agreement with Republicans."
The Democrats' slim majorities in the House and Senate only add to the balancing act facing lawmakers. At a news conference Monday, Omar said she was "clearly disappointed" to see the measure stalled in the Senate.
"I really think it is important to those who are negotiating with the Republican senators to continue to push for that conversation and for our president to continue to use his relationships and leverage with the senators so that we are able to finally pass that and get transformative legislation enacted in our country in regards to police reform," Omar said.
In Minnesota, state legislators continue to discuss a dozen police reform proposals put forward by House Democrats, with nearly all of the debate taking place behind the scenes before a likely mid-June special session.
On Tuesday, however, Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, cast new doubt over the prospects of policing legislation this session when he posted a video on Twitter pleading for more resources for police while expressing skepticism around the urgency for new police accountability measures.
Citing recent reports of gun violence around Minneapolis since the Legislature's regular session ended May 17, Gazelka said "more police" were the solution to the surging spate of violence in the city.
"It's not reforming police right now," Gazelka said. "That should not be the message. Get the police out on the streets, everybody cheer them on as they take back our streets, and we need more of them in Minneapolis."
A similar partisan view could still be ahead in Washington even if Scott, Bass and Booker reach an agreement. Republican Rep. Tom Emmer said in a statement that "efforts to reform our system of policing should be focused on providing more resources and training to our men and women in uniform, not less."
But Bass said in a Time magazine interview Tuesday that she was "very hopeful" about sending a bill to Biden soon, adding, "Senator Scott has said he sees a light at the end of the tunnel. And I agree with him on that."

Full text: WASHINGTON - The family of George Floyd met privately with President Joe Biden on Tuesday and pressed congressional leaders to strike a deal on a massive policing package one year after police killed Floyd on a south Minneapolis street.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris gathered with the Floyd family for about an hour Tuesday afternoon. Looming over the emotional day, however, was the inability of Congress to meet the president's deadline to advance police reform legislation by the anniversary of Floyd's death.
"If you can make federal laws to protect the bird which is the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of color," Philonise Floyd, George's brother, told reporters after the meeting.
He described Biden as a "genuine guy" and said the family was thankful. But he also made clear they want to see the police reform legislation named after George Floyd signed into law.
In March, House Democrats passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation was strongly opposed by Republicans, who favored a less sweeping series of changes.
After the family met with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Rep. Karen Bass in the morning, Pelosi told reporters, "They were lovely, they're optimistic, they're positive, but they're determined that we will get something done."
Outside the White House, Brandon Williams, George Floyd's nephew, said the president showed concern, and wanted to know how the family was doing and how he could support them.
"He did let us know that he supports passing the bill, but he wants to make sure that it's the right bill and not a rushed bill," Williams said. And on the deadline, Williams said Biden is "not happy about it not being met, but all in all, he just wants the bill to be right and meaningful and that it holds George's legacy intact."
One family member stayed home. George's sister Bridgett Floyd said in Minnesota that she will only travel to Washington when a bill is ready to be signed into law.
The reckoning on racial justice and policing stemming from Floyd's death last May hasn't been lost on Biden. The Democrat has put the Floyd family's experience front and center during major moments this year.
On the day former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of Floyd's murder, Biden and Harris called the family. The president could be heard telling the family they were "incredible" and "we're all so relieved," shortly after the verdict was announced. He later addressed the nation in a televised speech and called for further action and change in Floyd's memory by May 25.
An effort to find a bipartisan compromise in the Senate remains underway. Biden nodded to those talks in a statement after the Oval Office visit with the Floyd family. "It's my hope they will get a bill to my desk quickly," he said.
Yet Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided on police reform, even within Minnesota's congressional delegation.
"While it is disappointing that we have been unable to come up with an agreement on police reform, we will take as long as need be to get this legislation right," Republican Rep. Pete Stauber, a former police officer, said in a statement. "I will never support bad legislation just for the chance to say that we got something done in this space."
The meeting between Biden and the Floyd family is "deeply symbolic," Sen. Tina Smith said in an interview beforehand, and shows "the commitment that the president has to moving our country forward on racial justice."
"Missing this deadline, at the end of the day, will be less important than the strong bill that we have to pass," said Smith, a Democrat, of the legislation named after George Floyd.
Despite the family's grief, their trip to D.C. included some warm moments. Chris Stewart, a member of the family's legal team, said Biden played with George Floyd's young daughter Gianna who "had an absolute ball." The president said in his own statement that "the Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage" and singled out Gianna in particular.
"Being here today is an honor, to meet with the president and the vice president and for them to show their concern to our family and for them to actually give an ear to our concerns and how we feel on the situation," said Terrence Floyd, George's brother. "I feel it was a very productive conversation, and I'm grateful for it.'

Full text: At the south Minneapolis street corner where George Floyd was killed by police a year ago Tuesday, and at memorials and gatherings all over the country and world, people remembered the man whose death transformed a nation's understanding of police violence against its Black citizens.
"This is a living memorial, it's not a dead memorial," said Marquise Bowie of south Minneapolis, who joined a large crowd at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, the site of Floyd's deadly run-in with four Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day of 2020. "In order for something to live, something has to die. We are not going to mourn today, we are going to celebrate."
As President Joe Biden met in Washington with members of Floyd's family, again urging Congress to seal a deal on a federal policing legislation named in his honor, state and local leaders in Minnesota echoed the president's call to not squander the political momentum generated by Floyd's death.
"George Floyd is going to change the world," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a daytime event at a downtown park, hosted by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation and Visual Black Justice. "He's going to make sure that we look intentionally at ourselves, acknowledge our shortcomings and make sure that we all do better from here. This kind of police brutality cannot continue."
Last May 25, an employee at Cup Foods called 911 to report that Floyd had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. A cellphone video captured key moments of the 9 minutes and 29 seconds in which former officer Derek Chauvin knelt with his knee on the 46-year-old Floyd's neck. By the end, Floyd was dead.
"I didn't know this man from a can of paint, but I knew his life mattered," Darnella Frazier, who was 17 when she recorded that scene, posted Tuesday on Facebook. "I knew that he was another Black man in danger with no power."
Crowds swelled on a warm afternoon at the south side intersection, despite a jarring moment earlier in the day as activists were setting up for a gathering culminating with a candlelight vigil.
A series of gunshots rang out around 10 a.m., a moment captured live on an Associated Press broadcast being filmed nearby. People scrambled for cover, and witnesses reported a vehicle speeding away. Police said one person showed up at a nearby hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound that was not life-threatening.
It was a reminder that unrest and political turbulence in the days after Floyd's death are still fresh in local minds as Minneapolis deals with a spike in violent crime and a dwindling police force that's lost trust with many of the city's residents.
Memorials and protests in Floyd's honor cropped up around the globe Tuesday: in New York City and Washington and Floyd's hometown of Houston, at a socially distanced rally in Berlin and demonstrations in London and Glasgow, with a "Black Lives Matter" flag draped on the front of the U.S. Embassy in Athens.
It was an echo of sorts to last year's demonstrations and riots in the days that followed Floyd's death, which quickly spread around the U.S. and world. Minneapolis and St. Paul saw several nights of escalating unrest, which led Minneapolis leaders to abandon a police station under siege and resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to business owners along Lake Street and other hard-hit areas.
Chauvin was convicted April 20 on two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter in Floyd's death. He is scheduled to be sentenced in June. A federal grand jury this month indicted Chauvin and three other officers at the scene; those three officers also face state charges.
"We got a little bit of justice, but we really got no peace yet," Angie Evans said, standing near a table selling T-shirts at 38th and Chicago. "I pray and hope … that police will change the way they deal with our people, to not draw their guns first, or think the worst when they see a Black person."
Despite the grim nature of the anniversary, many who gathered in Minneapolis said there were reasons to celebrate. By the afternoon, the crowd at Commons Park near U.S. Bank Stadium had grown to several hundred. A band played on a stage, lending the feel of a summer music festival.
Food truck workers hauled in ice and fired up their grills. Organizers said they wanted it to feel like a party.
"We have to take in these good moments," said Athena Papagiannopoulos, a 25-year-old Minneapolis resident and activist who founded Visual Black Justice. It was another chance to celebrate Chauvin's conviction, she said, something many in the Black community thought would never happen.
"We're so used to hearing no," Papagiannopoulos said.
Around George Floyd Square, the mood had rebounded a few hours after the morning gunshots.
"It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining, you see little kids playing," said retired firefighter Tony Smith, who was raising money for homeless encampments in the area. "I just hope the shooting stays away. We don't need that here."
Aminata Seye, 24, traveled from her home in Houston -- Floyd's hometown -- to Minneapolis for the one-year remembrance. She joined a volunteer committee with the George Floyd Memorial Foundation and was helping stage the downtown event Tuesday.
"It means you're a part of history," Seye said of her first visit to the Twin Cities. "You get an opportunity to say you were part of organizing the first inaugural memorial for George Floyd. We're not just saying things. We're actually doing something."
Activist Toussaint Morrison said protesters and community organizers had no choice but to act, but that it remains to be seen if politicians and powerful institutions will support real change.
"This should be happening all the time," Morrison said, motioning to the celebration. "There should be Black joy and Black celebration all the time, and it shouldn't take a Black man dying for the city to create space for this."
Political leaders in Minneapolis and at the State Capitol have been embroiled in thorny debates about law enforcement accountability and police funding since Floyd's death. In November, Minneapolis residents will likely vote on whether to replace the police department with a new public safety agency. Gov. Tim Walz and DFL lawmakers, meanwhile, have been unable to persuade statehouse Republicans to sign on with new accountability measures beyond a collection of bipartisan measures passed last summer.
"Let us recommit ourselves to seeking meaningful police reform and working together to make lasting change in Minnesota," Walz said in a statement.
A proclamation from the governor had asked Minnesotans to observe 9 minutes and 29 seconds of silence in Floyd's honor at 1 p.m. Tuesday.
"We are here, and it's been a year," Bridgett Floyd, George's sister, said at the Commons Park memorial. "It's been a troubling year, a long year. But we made it."

GEORGE FLOYD: A YEAR OF RECKONING: IN FLOYD'S HOMETOWN, PRAYERS AND RESOLVE

Full text: HOUSTON - The sun was finally shining after a day of rain and gray skies.
Holding red and gold balloons, the crowd gathered Tuesday evening at the public housing complex where George Floyd grew up to contemplate his life and death. They bowed their heads. They fell silent.
The pastor said his first name means farmer.
"George Floyd planted seeds of hope, and hope is the expectation of good," said Catherine Smith, founder and executive director of Power4Life Ministries. "He planted seeds in this community and … the seeds that he planted shall last forever."
As Floyd's family met with President Joe Biden in Washington and people streamed in to pay their respects at the Minneapolis street corner where he spent his final moments, the Houston neighborhood where Floyd spent much of his life marked the occasion with a deeply personal sense of hope and loss.
May 25 in the Third Ward began quietly, as a trickle of visitors came to a mural honoring Floyd at Twee's corner store that morning. Gazing at the bright swirls of Floyd's face, Falani Broussard remarked that he was at a man at peace.
"He got some type of justice, but the work still isn't done," said Broussard, noting that police had killed innocent people since Floyd died. "I feel like change isn't going to happen overnight. It's not going to happen in a year. You have to keep it going and stay the course."
"He changed the world," agreed Bev Auguste. "Not just Houston. Not just Texas. Everywhere. Just one man."
A few steps away, Arthur Cash sat in his truck reading a month-old edition of the weekly Black newspaper, the Houston Forward Times. Its front page trumpeted Chauvin's murder conviction with the headline "GUILTY FINALLY." Cash once lived in Cuney Homes, the public housing project where Floyd grew up, and thought of him as a nephew.
Cash, 72, explained that he was thinking just what he thought a year ago: The killing never should have happened.
"Thank God," he said, "we got justice."
Across the street, Floyd's childhood friend Travis Cains stopped by. He was feeling weary, having just re-watched a speech he delivered at Floyd's funeral in Pearland, Texas. Cains reflected on how they hadn't gotten all the justice they wanted one year in, how the fight would have to persist.
Angelo Williams walked up and greeted him, lamenting that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act had not moved forward in Washington.
"They didn't pass that bill, man," Williams told him. "That wasn't just for George Floyd. That was for every individual."
Just after 4 p.m., an assortment of community leaders and Floyd's loved ones gathered at Cuney Homes' community center for the ribbon-cutting of a computer lab in Floyd's name. Rapper Trae tha Truth, who attended the Chauvin trial, helped put together the project, and spoke of his friendship with Floyd.
A local poet known as Sister Mama Sonya delivered a poem about Floyd and racial injustice, beginning with the statement "I can't breathe." She said it eight times.
"He called out in agony for his mother as he lay writhing in pain/Unable to move or breathe as he cried out again and again/As the murderous Minneapolis policeman's lethal actions resulted in his demise/He became the newest statistic and another murderous policeman's prize."
She wove together a narrative of his deep roots here, vowing to attack injustices and lift up Floyd's memory.
"Keep fighting, keep pushing, combating this hate/Until no other brother or sister, no other George Floyd will experience this odious fate."
"Say his name!"
"George Floyd!"
Around 5:20 p.m., Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee took the podium, Floyd's sisters and nieces gathered behind her.
She told everyone to imagine what happened on this day in 2020. Imagine the girl who stood there courageously with her phone, she said. Imagine the firefighter who tried to render aid. Imagine the martial arts expert who understood what the officers' actions were doing to Floyd's body.
"But out of that and what they have experienced, America's family never turned to anger and hatred and contempt," she said of Floyd's survivors.
Houston Police Commander Caroleta Johnson vowed to not let the name of George Floyd die.
"There will be no more Derek Chauvins," she said. "Because that is not what we're made of as police officers."
The crowd prayed. They gave thanks. They shouted words of encouragement. They vowed that the push for change would not be over, that this was a day of reflection and the future was an era of action.
"My brother has all the power," said LaTonya Floyd, Floyd's older sister. "All the glory. He won. He won, OK? Derek is suffering. He will continue to suffer and I will continue to pray for that man."
They walked outside. Across a courtyard at Cuney Homes, a new generation of Black boys played on the same basketball court where Floyd had played as a child. Pastor Smith took the microphone. Each person took a balloon.
"It's harvest time … for change in this world," she said. "And we will work the ground that George Floyd laid and till the land for him."
The men, women and children raised their balloons in Floyd's honor, and chanted his name. Then they released them into the sky, shouting with joy as the specks of red and gold swirled far away.

The Minneapolis foundation, which announced the unsolicited grants Tuesday, will give $100,000 each to the Minnesota groups working to make the state more inclusive and address systemic justice.
Each organization "connects to our vision of a more equitable Minnesota, the type of place that would have sparked and enabled the life of George Floyd, not extinguished it," McKnight President Tonya Allen said in a statement.
The first recipient is the Cultural Wellness Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that addresses the health and well-being of African Americans. The other recipients were not publicly announced.
"As challenging as this past year has been since Brother Floyd's murder, the support shown by leading institutions like McKnight gives me hope," Atum Azzahir, the center's director, said in a statement.
Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked unprecedented philanthropy, especially toward groups serving communities of color or working on racial justice. It also prompted many foundations and nonprofits to make internal changes, such as increasing the diversity of staff and board members.
"Those of us who work in institutions with wealth and privilege must use that power to rewrite the rules -- to transform the systems that have historically blocked people, particularly people of color, from opportunities to thrive," Allen said.
McKnight recently announced it was partnering with the Ford Foundation to provide $7 million in grants to Black, Indigenous, Latin and Asian American-led organizations in theater and visual arts, music and spoken word. The foundation also has earmarked $5.4 million for a new grant program focused on economic mobility for Native Americans and immigrants.
The Bush Foundation is spending $100 million to address wealth gaps among Native Americans and African Americans, and Black leaders formed the Alliance of Alliances to raise $4 million and advance racial equity.
At the University of Minnesota Law School, more than $270,000 has been raised for a scholarship in Floyd's name. The first scholarship will go to a student of color this fall.
Catlan McCurdy and Sanjiv Laud of Minneapolis, who met at the school, started the fund and hope to diversify a largely white profession. McCurdy said the number of donors has been inspiring. "It's grown so much," she said. "It will really go far in providing funds for minority students."

Full text: A year later, Minnesota United goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair and a few of his teammates still raise a fist skyward during the national anthem in the name of racial justice and George Floyd.
Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin a year ago Tuesday. It's a date that St. Clair calls a "constant reminder" of racism that goes far beyond 38th Street and Chicago Avenue.
"It's still a problem we've seen throughout the country," he said. "If you look not only at George Floyd, but all the deaths that have happened since then, just in this last year alone. The fight hasn't stopped, but I'm glad George Floyd has been a catalyst, unfortunately. We need to continue to push the envelope and get actual change."
St. Clair and teammates Jacori Hayes, Hassani Dotson and Romain Metanire each raise a fist before games, just as MLS' Black players did in protest as the independent organization Black Players for Change before the MLS is Back tournament opened last summer.
One year after Floyd's death, the group joined with the NBA Players Association to push for passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in March but remains in the Senate.
"It's up to people we elected to make those differences and make the changes," Hayes said.
Minnesota United has matched other local pro teams' donations to the George Floyd Global Memorial Fund. It also has joined with brothers Jeremy and Justin Sutherland on an "In Diversity We Trust" sportswear collection. It also plans to light Allianz Field for an upcoming "Day of Racial Reckoning."
Raised in suburban Toronto, St. Clair lives mere miles from the site where Floyd's death rocked the world.
"It's sad to see it happen in your home community, but at the same time it's inspiring to see the community get together, fight for a cause and be a catalyst for everything," St. Clair said.
Hayes drove by a rally at the site on Sunday.
"The city still remembers," he said. "It's very chilling because you think it's something that happens almost in a different world. To know that I go out to eat somewhere and it's a couple blocks away from where he was murdered."
Hayes visited 38th and Chicago twice last year. St. Clair has been there twice as well.
"It's tough, knowing what happened there and knowing it could have been me, it could have been one of my teammates, it could have been one of my friends," St. Clair said.
Hoping for Reynoso
Star midfielder Emanuel Reynoso continued to work indoors on his own Tuesday because of a knee issue as the team prepares to play Real Salt Lake on Saturday.
"We're hoping he's ready for the weekend," coach Adrian Heath said. "But if not, we certainly won't rush him. It's a case of wait and see, really."
They're here
Recently signed forward Adrien Hunou trained with his new teammates for the first time Tuesday in Blaine and new left-side attacker Franco Fragapane is expected to join Wednesday.
"Adrien hasn't played a full game for five weeks now," Heath said. "He's still a bit ring-rusty, shall we say. He might not have that extra little zip you get from playing matches.
"But Fragapane probably enjoyed two, three days' rest because he has been playing every four days for the last three, four months."

Basketball takes rare back seat for Reeve: The Lynx coach wanted to talk about social justice Tuesday before her usual subject.

Full text: The Lynx were trying to run a COVID-19-induced virtual training camp when George Floyd was murdered in south Minneapolis.
That was a year ago. So, after finishing practice at their training facility Tuesday, Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve talked about social change before anything basketball related. A lot has happened since the day Floyd died, she said.
More is to come.
"There is so much in terms of what needs to happen, but I think there's been actionable change that I'm seeing in some cities that are changing something as simple as unarmed officers are the ones that are going to make the traffic stop that involved an expired tag, an air freshener, that sort of thing," Reeve said. "So there has been real illumination of the ways in which the system is flawed and needs change."
The Lynx were ahead of their time back in 2016 when captains Lindsay Whalen, Rebekkah Brunson, Maya Moore and Seimone Augustus stood up for the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the killing of Philando Castile. Since then both the WNBA and the NBA have come up to speed.
The NBA as a league, and the players unions for both the NBA and WNBA players are involved in calling for passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act; Wednesday the WNBA's players union executives and the union's board of player representation will meet with New Jersey senator Cory Booker.
Reeve said perhaps her strongest memory of last season was the sense of commitment to social change within the WNBA bubble at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. The players dedicated the season to Breonna Taylor, publicly backing the Black Lives Matter movement. The players took a two-day pause during the season after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wis. And WNBA players campaigned for Raphael Warnock, who was opposing Kelly Loeffler for a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia after Loeffler -- also then a co-owner of the Atlanta Dream -- spoke out against the BLM movement.
"Being in the bubble together as a league, we had a chance to just do so much more and amplify, in a very significant way, the need for criminal justice reform, the need for reform in our policing," Reeve said. "So we've had a chance to really educate ourselves in the ways that you can enact change. … We weren't going there just to play basketball. That was secondary. They were going there on a mission to, collectively, use our voices."
Working to pass the bill that bears Floyd's name is a start. The Wolves' Karl-Anthony Towns is a member of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition advocating for the bill. In Minnesota, the Wolves and Lynx are working with the Minneapolis Foundation to promote social justice and safe communities.
"There is police reform, which is very real," Reeve said. "But then I think there is also impacting our communities. Bringing to light, for our communities, the systemic inequities."
The next step?
"The actual reform part of it," Reeve said. "Understanding legislation that's on the books, what needs changing, making sure elective officials are bringing about those changes. … Voting is one way, and now, after you vote, it's your ability to understand legislation that currently exists, and any change you want and how to go about getting that change."
Wolves, Floyd family meet
The Timberwolves say members of the organization and Josh Okogie met today via Zoom with members of George Floyd's family to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his death, honor George's life and discuss ways to enact change going forward.

GEORGE FLOYD: A YEAR OF RECKONING: THE CROSSROADS OF MINNEAPOLIS

Full text: Storied 38th Street and Chicago Avenue rests in the heart of south Minneapolis, where a middle-class Black community planted businesses, schools and one of the city's oldest newspapers in the 1930s, and where resident families, once ravaged by the crack epidemic and war on drugs, continue to fight against the forces of gentrification and displacement.
On May 25, 2020, George Perry Floyd Jr. was killed by the Minneapolis police. His death in the street, beneath an officer's knee, was recorded by agitated bystanders including local teen Darnella Frazier, whose cellphone video swept the world.
In the volatile days that followed, residents poured into the streets in a series of mass demonstrations. Rioters torched the minority business districts of Lake Street and W. Broadway after nightfall.
Organically, the intersection of 38th and Chicago metamorphosed into an elaborate memorial and community haven overflowing with flowers, protest art, music, cookouts and food drives.
As the months wore on through fall and a frigid winter, a small group of activists continued to guard blockades of concrete barricades, iron barriers known as Czech hedgehogs, and bike racks separating "George Floyd Square" from the rest of the city.
The activists demanded the city meet 24 conditions, including removing the elected county attorney, before they'll cede the semi-autonomous zone, where police and others deemed undesirable are not welcome. Their rallying cry: "No justice, no street."
Today, a complex interplay of power defines George Floyd Square, which sits in the center of the Metropolitan Council's plans to construct a rapid bus line along Chicago.
The city intends to build a permanent memorial to Floyd in the intersection while developing 38th Street as a cultural corridor. Black business owners within the square and Worldwide Outreach for Christ, a church that has been a pillar of the intersection for nearly 40 years, object to the activists' self-authorized occupation, which they allege gives cover to the local Bloods gang. People lost to gun violence at the square since Floyd's death include Dameon Chambers, Imez Wright, Leneesha Columbus, who was pregnant, and her infant child.
Nevertheless, George Floyd Square remains an active protest site, ever-changing memorial and flexible space for progressive groups to host events and strategize across a wide range of causes, including fighting the Line 3 pipeline in northern Minnesota and supplying Minneapolis' widespread homeless encampments. It draws tourists the world over and presents a living classroom for families to teach children about racial injustice.
City leaders have said the intersection will open to traffic, but they haven't said when.
After Derek Chauvin was convicted in April of murdering Floyd, Jeanelle Austin, founder of the nonprofit George Floyd Global Memorial, said occupiers intend to keep the street until they get justice as a way of life, defined and designed by the people.

GEORGE FLOYD: A YEAR OF RECKONING: ARE WHITE LEADERS TRULY COMMITTED TO CHANGE?

Author: Medcalf, Myron

https://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/george-floyd-year-reckoning/docview/2531762956/se-2?accountid=12598

Full text: Nearly 100 years before George Floyd was murdered, three African American circus workers were lynched by a white mob after they were falsely accused of raping a white woman, Irene Tusken, in Duluth. An infamous postcard from the scene of the lynchings shows proud white men posing with the bodies of Elmer Jackson, Elias Clayton and Isaac McGhie.
The photo, however, does not show every character. A white priest, William Powers, climbed the light pole that night and attempted to stop the lynchings, per Michael Fedo's book "The Lynchings in Duluth." That remains the choice for white Minnesotans today: complicity or empathy.
Whenever I hear someone say, "George Floyd changed us," I wonder whom they're referencing.
Because his murder one year ago did not change Black people's understanding of our place in this state or this country. We've always known systemic racism could kill our dreams and end our lives.
But I do believe Floyd's murder challenged white people in Minnesota to make a decision about who they want to be. It is not the first time. White people here have always had an opportunity to address the damage created by their privilege and power. In a difficult year for all, however, I've learned this exercise is futile unless we offer one another room for growth -- albeit time-sensitive growth.
After everything white Minnesotans have read and discussed and digested over the last year, I am left with one question: What will white people do now? The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said true freedom would not materialize "until there is a committed empathy on the part of the white man of this country." That's the first ingredient for equity in Minnesota, too.
"Some of us have to convince our white colleagues that there really is systemic racism," said Rick King, the chair of the Metropolitan Airports Commission, "and we really do need to fix this."
To discuss the next steps, I contacted some of the area's most powerful white leaders a year after Floyd's murder: Commissioner King; Gov. Tim Walz; Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey; Dr. Penny Wheeler, CEO of Allina Health; Glen Gunderson, president of the YMCA of the North; University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel and General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening.
I wanted to interrogate their intentions and know more about their choices, changes and decisions during this painful year, beyond the news releases and talking points.
Acknowledge our humanity
Over the last year, Wheeler has endured a difficult chapter. She and her partner, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Margaret Chutich, suffered the loss of their 21-year-old daughter, Olivia Chutich, in February. It was their daughter who first mentioned the video of Derek Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck.
"Yeah, that moment won't ever be forgotten," Wheeler told me. "It's all the more salient now for me, personally, because she isn't here any longer."
Wheeler said there is a collection of energized individuals who want to change the perception of Minnesota as a broken place for nonwhite folks. She said she has spent the last year listening to a diverse pool of individuals at her company and focusing on the disparities within the health care system, magnified by COVID-19's disproportionate impact on communities of color.
Wheeler, a female executive in a same-sex marriage and a mother of a daughter who was born in Guatemala, is not ignorant to discriminatory practices. But the past year challenged her perspectives and ideas around race and the experiences of those who are not white in Minnesota.
"I didn't know, for example, that many in my own organization couldn't feel like they could show up fully when they entered a room, couldn't be their whole self," she said. "If they were Black, they had to act a little more white to be accepted."
I value her transparency. People of color in Minnesota go through a series of white checkpoints each day via our supervisors, corporate policies, laws and neighbors. The greatest challenge in those interactions is the belief that whiteness is both the most effective and efficient way to live here. I believe that's what some of Wheeler's employees referenced in their encounters with her. The "Why can't you be more like us?" philosophy dilutes our value and asks us to compromise our identities.
Therefore, the request over the last year is no different from the hope for any group: acknowledge our humanity. Because that begets a sense of security and belonging, both lacking for the state's marginalized communities.
That's why I asked the governor if Black people are safe in the state he leads.
"I don't think it's for me to answer," he said. "If Black people tell me they're not, then they're not. I believe them. I hear them. I'm proud of what this state does. And this is, again, that intersection of both my individual, how I see things, and then recognize that being governor makes you a manifestation of the state. That I do have to accept that this state has a long way to go."
That's the foundation of empathy. It's saying, "How are you?" and meaning it, while also vowing to understand that individual's or community's pain.
But Walz also told me, "I also feel defensive and I feel ashamed" about criticisms of the state. That's a hurdle for white Minnesotans in our collective dialogue about systemic racism. It not only minimizes our truth about what being a member of a marginalized community in Minnesota means to us, but it also centers the white experience over our own. I think white people here, if they want, can understand racism's power and recognize the overt disparities. Too often, however, their perspectives only consider their emotions. But feeling guilty about systemic racism is a lot different from being killed by it.
The value of listening, learning
Gunderson, the CEO of YMCA of the North, learned more about the concerns within his organization last summer when the board at the Douglas Dayton YMCA in downtown Minneapolis accused his organization of "deep seated and systemic racism." A series of anonymous allegations also arrived through an Instagram account aimed at the group led by Gunderson, who called the claims "an incredible soul punch." He said he resolved to alter the perception of the YMCA and validate those within his organization who seek more support.
"I remember the first time that we saw some of that feedback, I could sense the team getting defensive," Gunderson said. "And I said, 'This is such an important reckoning for the broad community and for the YMCA. This is an important collective voice and we just need to listen.' There is no need to be defensive."
Frey said he listened over the last year, too. He said he'd recognized disparities for communities of color in his city before Floyd's murder. But the killing challenged him and others.
"It's not like I didn't know they existed, but the acute nature through which this murder was experienced made it, I think in a good way, made it unavoidable for white people," he said, "and in the process, unavoidable for me."
Our conversation turned to policing in the city. He said, with his role, he can address use-of-force measures and traffic stops, acts that unnecessarily and routinely place people of color in harm's way. He also said he needs more power to fire officers accused of wrongdoing, which is disrupted by the arbitration process.
"When you think back to watching that video [of Floyd's murder], the first thing that occurred to me is the absolute lack of humanity," he told me. "It was this lack of understanding from Chauvin that this other person that he was kneeling on was a human being."
I don't think the scenario Frey described is complete. I don't think Chauvin, or any other officer who commits an inhumane act against an individual, wrestles with understanding. I think Chauvin felt empowered in his refusal to consider Floyd's humanity, much like the white mob that lynched the three Black men in Duluth nearly 100 years ago, because they believed white people would support them the way they had in other acts of brutality against Black bodies.
And that's the danger within any conversation about moving forward a year after Floyd's killing.
I know words will never mature into equity until there is a collective agreement among white people to commit to the empathy necessary to unravel systemic racism. Without it, this place will be ripe for more horror.
"It is relatively easy to make statements and it's relatively easy to write checks and to try to make things go away that way," said General Mills' Harmening. "But in the end, we're only going to be judged by our actions."
What will they say about Minnesota's white leaders in the future?
Gabel, the U's president, recognized the value of empathy backed by action when she decided, days after Floyd was murdered, to end her university's contracts with the Minneapolis Police Department for large events and specialized services after conversations with a variety of groups.
"If something like what happened happens a few blocks down the road from us, and we just say, 'What a tragedy,' then it's not enough," she told me. "What can we actually do within the authority that we have? That's how the decision was made."
Gabel, who grew up in Atlanta, was working as an administrator in Missouri when Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson in 2014, and she was working in South Carolina a year later when nine Black members of a church in Charleston were executed by a white gunman. She said those experiences shaped her perspective before a challenging first year at the University of Minnesota. They also taught her she has more to learn.
"I think one of the biggest lessons I learned that has been, I think, helpful and also humbling is that I didn't learn everything I needed to know in Atlanta," she said. "And I didn't learn everything I needed to know in Missouri. Even after I lived through the tragedy of the Mike Brown shooting, I didn't learn everything I needed to know. In South Carolina, even after the 'Emanuel Nine,' I still didn't learn everything I needed to know, but I'm learning a little more each time."
As I spoke with some of Minnesota's top leaders, I kept thinking about that postcard from the Duluth lynchings almost 100 years ago. It is difficult to grapple with these issues in real time. But we can all relate to legacy. Just like with those white men in that photo in Duluth, Minnesotans will one day discuss our choices and decisions after another great tragedy.
I asked each white leader how they hope to be remembered when this period is analyzed in the future.
Walz paused before he answered.
"I hope they say that he had a shared humanity with us, that he did the best of his ability in that moment to make sure that every single Minnesotan was valued," he said. "I don't think a lot about legacy but I do think about this: If I don't serve this community well and I don't serve trying to move the needle on systemic racism, I would consider that to be the greatest failure of my life."
Harmening said he hopes people will say "he didn't waste the opportunity to make a difference."
King said he's spent the last year reading and researching. The MAC chair said he has read his copy of the New York Times' "1619 Project" multiple times. The conclusion he's reached? He didn't know more about America's dark history because he had not made an effort to know. In 100 years, he told me, he hopes he's remembered as someone who was "always seeking to understand."
For Wheeler, however, the question was personal. The Duluth postcard was not just a tragic piece of history for her and her family.
"That's where my father grew up," she told me. "And he was just a few years old at the time that the lynchings happened. But when I looked at those horrible, horrible pictures, I looked to see, gosh, was my grandfather there? Was he one of the ones trying to stop it? Or was he one of the ones validating it as the right thing to do?"
Future generations will ask the same questions of us. And they will talk about us in their conversations, their classrooms, their books, their living rooms, their barbershops and their documentaries. They might even hang our pictures on their walls.
A year after George Floyd's murder, white Minnesotans must choose the proper lens.

Full text: "It's honestly changed the way I feel about Minnesota and Minneapolis … There's a lot more awareness and understanding, but awareness and understanding of how deeply messed up and structural this is. For me it's so clear how this goes back centuries, and my mind is linking it to different forms of racialized violence. There's an understanding of all this now. But I don't think it's getting better. It's just that now we see it." Enid Logan, associate professor & associate chair, Department of Sociology, University of Minnesota --- "George Floyd's murder was such a pivotal point in my relationship with my son when it comes to talking about race. Now we had something we could relate to -- something we'd gone through together. We were experiencing this at the same time … I remember the day after the huge riots in south Minneapolis, we stayed up all night following the news, watching things being burned down. I got up early and got dressed. He and my mother and I drove down on Lake Street, parked the car and walked around. I needed him to not only watch it on TV but know this is happening practically in our backyard … We were arming him with information and skills, giving him solutions. But he now had his own pinions. It wasn't, 'My mom or my dad said this.' It was, 'This is [messed] up.' I had a sense of pride. It was clear that he was aware of who he is as a young Black man." Alysha Price , CEO of the Price Dynamic, a professional family-coaching
firm --- "It hits me hard and daily. I live at 41st and Elliott. I'm three blocks from the site where he was killed … The protests, the uprising, the smoke, the helicopters, all of that was very real in the course of our summer. And then the occupation of the intersection, its renaming, its reformation, has been an ongoing part of our lives for the past year, mostly in profound and beautiful ways … George Floyd Square is a contested place. It's not necessarily something the city wants to have. I have neighbors who are actively involved there, and I have neighbors who are ready for the street to open, dammit . You have both perspectives really in tension." Tania Mitchell, associate professor of higher education, University of Minnesota, mother of a 3-year-old --- "After George Floyd, we started a cross-cultural advisory committee to the city. Nine members appointed to the group by the City Council. In the 1990s we were 10,000 people and 99% white. Over the years we've grown to 14,000 and about 50% immigrant. We have 12 different cultures represented here in Worthington. We have 50 or so immigrant-owned businesses throughout the city. It's rejuvenated our downtown … (Floyd's death) creates a lot of worry in our community at large. There's always the worry that something could happen … All this stuff certainly has me more on guard. If the same situation happened here, who knows? " Mike Kuhle, mayor of Worthington

George Floyd: A year of reckoning: When remembering the dead is not enough

Full text: The families came from all over the country to honor George Floyd. They all had one tragic thing in common: Their loved ones' names became synonymous with a movement only because of their deaths.
It is a fraternity, they said, of which no one wants to be a part.
On the dais at the downtown Minneapolis hotel Monday was the mother of Oscar Grant (killed in 2009 by transit police in the Bay Area). Next to her was the mother of Eric Garner (killed by a New York police officer in 2014), who was seated next to the mother of Trayvon Martin (killed by a neighborhood watch coordinator in 2012). A few seats down was the mother of Daunte Wright (killed by a Brooklyn Center police officer last month).
On the dais and in the audience for the panel discussion were even more: Family members of Jacob Blake, and Breonna Taylor, and Alvin Cole, and Botham Jean, and Corey Jones. The names have provided momentum for a movement toward police accountability and racial justice that has become more pronounced in the year since Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.
One year after Floyd's death and one month after Chauvin's murder conviction, these families implored Minnesotans and Americans to take last year's moment that erupted into nationwide protests and turn it into a sustaining movement to effect lasting change in courtrooms, legislative chambers and media. The "From Protest to Policy" panel discussion, moderated by civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson and livestreamed on Facebook, was part of the George Floyd Memorial Foundation's Inaugural Remembrance.
"We represent so many other families," said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin. "Continue to support them; don't just support them when it just happened. ... A lot of people talk way too much for me. They talk a lot. But guess what? The action is what's important. If you want to be a community activist, then you need to act. Posting it on your social media, that's one thing. But the real work is in your actions."
Many police officers and their supporters have decried Chauvin's actions as ruthless and lawless, a bad apple who unfairly stained the law enforcement profession.
But this group of families spoke of a rotten system. They wanted the one-year remembrance of Floyd's death to serve as a reminder for systemic reform.
In the aftermath of Chauvin's conviction last month, celebrations erupted on the lawn outside the Hennepin County Government Center and on the street corner where Floyd was killed. The feeling among those celebrating was that a battle had been won for racial justice, but more work was needed.
Kattie Jones, the stepmother of Corey Jones, who was shot and killed by a Florida police officer in 2015, spoke about why her family continues to fight even after that officer is now serving a 25-year prison term.
"Is the conviction enough?" Jones asked. "It is the start. But it doesn't stop the modern-day lynching."
Those wins in court, these family members said, are fleeting. The bigger wins are institutional changes.
"I have talked to many politicians, and I have heard many games played by politicians," said Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother. "I don't believe in writing letters. I don't believe in phone calls. I like to get right up in their face. When I get there, I tell them what my demands are -- not my asks, but my demands.
"This is how in New York we first got the executive order for the special prosecutor" in Garner's case, she continued. "The New York mothers, we kept asking to speak with [Gov. Andrew Cuomo]. He wouldn't have a sit-down with us. What we did, we went up to Albany with the makeshift coffins of our children and sat right in front of his door and said, 'What are you going to do about these bodies?' "
Last year, the New York State Assembly passed the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, which banned chokeholds that result in injury or death.
Congress is still in discussions about the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a sweeping bill about policing practices, accountability and training. But the bill almost certainly will not pass by President Joe Biden's deadline of this week.
And the debate over policing continues at the State Capitol in St. Paul, where the divided Legislature is deadlocked over a dozen police accountability proposals. The measures would bring about changes related to traffic stops and new no-knock warrant regulations. It would also allow communities to create citizen boards to provide oversight over law enforcement.
Ben Crump, the attorney representing Floyd's and Wright's families, said Floyd's death offers an opportunity like none before.
"I don't think our white brothers and sisters can even fathom our reality, because it's so foreign to them," Crump said. "When we watched George Floyd being tortured to death for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, and our white brothers and sisters saw it, they were like, 'Oh, this is real.' They couldn't fathom it. I think they couldn't imagine that happening to a human being. But for every Black person I talk to in America, they understand: 'But by the grace of God, that could be me.'
"We can't lose this momentum," Crump continued. "It's been 57 years since we had meaningful police reform in America. Everybody up here, your blood is on that [federal] legislation. Literally. We don't want to have something just to say, 'Hey, they signed a bill.' No. It's got to be meaningful."

-- Responding to local protests over George Floyd, the City Council in Hamilton, New Zealand, removes a statue of British Capt. John Fane Charles Hamilton, the city's namesake celebrated for his role in a war against the Indigenous Maori people.
-- Belgium removes the statue of its colonial-era King Leopold II, blamed for the nation's bloody oppression of Congo, after protests over George Floyd break out in Ghent.
Business
-- The parent companies of Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth syrups, Cream of Wheat cereal and Uncle Ben's rice announce they're overhauling the brands to eliminate racial stereotypes.
-- Pharmacy chains including Walgreens, Walmart and CVS discontinue the practice of securing Black beauty products in anti-theft cases.
-- IBM notifies Congress that it will no longer market facial recognition technology in response to demands for police reforms.
-- Mutual of Omaha replaces its Indian chief logo with a lion, a reference to its longtime sponsorship of "Wild Kingdom."
-- Google CEO Sundar Pichai pledges to raise the proportion of "underrepresented groups" in leadership to 30% by 2025.
Culture
-- The Paramount cable network cancels the long-running reality TV program "Cops" after a public outcry that it glorifies police and denigrates communities.
-- Responding to concerns last summer, Scrabble tournaments officially ban the use of 236 words deemed racial and ethnic slurs or otherwise objectionable.
-- The massively popular video game Fortnite, with 350 million players worldwide, removes police cars after an update in June.
-- Producers of the long-running animated TV show "The Simpsons" announce that white actors will no longer voice nonwhite characters.
-- The University of Pennsylvania's museum agrees to remove the display of 1,000 human skulls, some of them of enslaved people, in part because they were used to justify slavery on "scientific" grounds.

An artist remembers George Floyd in song: The public will get a chance to hear Joe Davis' works Tuesday.

Full text: For Minneapolis artist Joe Davis, music is one of the most powerful methods of healing that "hits us straight in the heart."
Davis, who is known for his spoken word poetry and music, has written three songs honoring George Floyd. Community members can hear them Tuesday as part of a town hall event held by Westminster Presbyterian Church and featuring Floyd's aunt Angela Harrelson and his cousin Paris Stevens.
Davis started to write his most recent song "Love Like Fire" last summer as a tribute to Floyd and finished during the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.
"Last summer was filled with a lot of fire," Davis said, referring to the riots that left parts of the Twin Cities in flames. "I think that fire can oftentimes be seen as something that's dangerous and harmful, but I also think that fire can be healing and it can be cleansing."
Inspiration for the song came partly from the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. about the transformative power of love and Davis' views that people should not become complacent but continue to push for peace and healing. Davis, who lives in north Minneapolis and has participated in rallies and protests, said artists play a crucial role in the movement for change.
"I feel like artists are uniquely positioned to show people what's possible," he said. "I think a lot of times we don't have a lot of practice imagining what's possible because we see the reality of the status quo. … Artists can say, 'Hey look over here. This is what our ancestors did or this is what we dreamed the world can be. Let's try to create that and make that art a reality.' "
"Love Like Fire" was composed in collaboration with musician Ryan Bynum and performed with singers Imani Waters, Traiveon Dunlap and Courtland Pickens with the youth choir Known.

LOVE LIKE FIRE
LYRICS BY JOE DAVIS
This is for all those whose love for healing and justice doesn't wax cold
But grows stronger with the breath of our ancestors
And when I say love
I mean a love like fire
Chorus:
I wish somebody's soul would catch on fire
Catch on fire
Catch on fire
I wish somebody's soul would catch on fire
Catch on fire
Burning 'til we're healed and whole
Verse 1:
Some run from it
Some run to it
How you just now feelin' that fire?
When we already done been through it?
Some burn flags, crosses and bibles / This fire burns inside us to fight for survival
Some shed blood from gunfire of rivaling rifles / This fire comes cuz it's time to ignite a revival
This that HOLY ghost fire
Set it off / make ya WHOLE soul light up
Inspire the sick and tired to get up and fight for they life 'til there's ain't no mo' sick and tired
Not violent or coerced
But a gentle guiding force
Like a vibrant torch
Giving light and warmth
Not a riot but uprising
From love as a deep, abiding source
(C'mon hit me with the chorus)
Verse 2:
Some thangs we need to retrieve and some thangs we need to leave (let it burn)
If this is an upheaval than some thangs we need to upheave (let it burn)
If we're limited or freed by our beliefs then what do we even believe?! (let it burn)
What means are necessary to let all people breathe?!
Burn our grief and rage into the flames of liberation (let it burn)
Burn your guilt and shame into the flames of reparations (let it burn)
Each flame is an anguish which can't be tamed and contained in language
It burns away our chains and cages
Until all that remains is
All that we're made of
And all that we're made of is love
Bridge:
What needs to die and why won't we let it?
What needs new life to be resurrected?
And is death always a prerequisite?
This is the process of perfection and we're not perfected yet
It may burn but not meant to burn us
It may hurt but not meant to hurt us, but
Free us from our burdens
Refine, purify, and purge us
Until the fruit-bearing root buried beneath the surface
Re-merges
We won't be consumed
We'll blossom and bloom
We'll rise like a butterfly who lost its cocoon
We'll rise
God gave Noah the rainbow sign
No more water ...
It's fire this time
Outro:
This fire is healing
This fire is cleansing
Don't try to conceal what this fires revealing
It's the breath of our ancestors that we breathe
As we shout our demands in the street
Their blood flows through our hands and our feet
No longer waiting for their chance to be free

GEORGE FLOYD: A YEAR OF RECKONING: MEMORIES SCAR HIS HOMETOWN

Full text: HOUSTON - They still come here, as if making a pilgrimage to history.
Bianca Williams regularly sees the well-wishers stop to take pictures at the mural of George Floyd that looms over the street where he spent much of his life. There is always someone new, and just past noon on Sunday, it is a pair of traveling nurses from Florida paying their respects.
"That's my uncle," Williams tells them. "We're getting ready for the one-year anniversary."
The women ask her to pose for a photo. "Give me a hug -- oh my God," says one of the nurses, Alvina McThenney, and the strangers embrace like dear friends. "One more picture?"
Those closest to Floyd have confronted an agonizing loss since May 25, 2020, when bystanders outside a south Minneapolis convenience store filmed police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd until he died.
Nearly 1,200 miles away, Floyd's hometown circle weighs the grief that he suffered, a torture that no human should endure, against the faith that his death inspired a lasting movement for racial justice.
For Floyd's loved ones, that reckoning has been constant. Williams, 27, has just been reflecting on how her family survived hell. Exchanges like these from Floyd's supporters give her hope about the compassion and awakening that followed.
---
"Have you seen the video?"
It is the morning of May 26, 2020, and Williams' sister is calling. Williams doesn't know what is going on. She panics.
"You got my stomach in my shoes, now what is it?" Williams presses. "Tell me."
Her sister says that Floyd is dead. Williams drops to the ground. She weeps. She doesn't watch the video. She does go to see her mother, Floyd's oldest sister, Zsa Zsa, and his second oldest sister, LaTonya. The women have already heard; they seclude themselves in a room, afraid that stepping outside will make Floyd's killing real.
Williams comforts them as best as she can but knows their anguish is beyond her understanding.
She grew up in this city's Third Ward in the same house as Floyd. Without her own dad, she considered Floyd almost a father. He walked Williams to school, bought her new shoes with the little money he had and cheered at her basketball games, encouraging her to be aggressive on the court.
As Floyd's death triggers worldwide demonstrations against police killings of Black people, Williams tends to her newborn son, Amir. Born a month before, he will join the next generation of Black boys and men that could benefit from the activism inspired by his great-uncle. Williams also has a 4-year-old daughter, Arianna.
"Kiss Ari for me," Floyd said the last time they talked.
She tells her daughter that Floyd is in a better place. Williams never explains that police took his life.
---
Family and friends must soon sort out what roles to take on as the world looks to them to make sense of Floyd's life, death and legacy. Within weeks, younger brother Philonise Floyd -- one of the six siblings -- becomes an advocate for police reform. He testifies to Congress: "I'm here today to ask you to make it stop."
LaTonya, for her part, is content to cede the spotlight to him. When she sees the image of her brother trapped under an officer's body, she views Floyd as the child she grew up with, not the 46-year-old he is at the time of his death, and that is sometimes too much for her to bear.
She was 5 when her mother brought George Perry Floyd home from the hospital on Oct. 14, 1973. LaTonya and Zsa Zsa would play hide and seek with Floyd, ducking in a cardboard
box that they had fashioned into a playhouse with teacups.
As a kid, Floyd would teach her the current slang. "What a do?" he'd greet her, using a colloquialism for "what's up?" She'd reply that she didn't do anything. "No, Tonya," Floyd would say with amusement. "That's not it." As adults, they cared for their ill mother together in the years before Floyd's departure for Minneapolis in 2017.
In the months after Floyd's death, LaTonya wishes it could have been her instead of him. She reasons that she is the older one. She doesn't have kids, like he did. She wants to spare him the pain of his last moments.
One day LaTonya drinks. She thinks about killing herself. LaTonya has never felt so weak. She closes her eyes and cries. She hears Floyd's voice.
No, sis. You've got to keep going. I need you down there. Stay right where you are.
LaTonya thinks God is speaking to her through Floyd. She decides it is not her time after all, and opens her eyes.
There are bright moments. Growing up, LaTonya taught Floyd to sing "Keep on Loving You" by REO Speedwagon, and it became a tradition for the pair to croon the soft-rock power ballad together. In April, the band's lead singer Kevin Cronin surprises her with the plaque honoring the 1981 hit's platinum status.
She knows just where to put it: a wall of Williams' apartment dedicated to Floyd's memory. They display it amid a patchwork of photographs, news articles and artistic renderings of him arranged around a large blanket emblazoned with an image of a solemn-faced Floyd.
LaTonya sleeps with a blanket just like it. Before she turns in, she says, "Good night, bro." She hears Floyd say good night back. That is all she hears from him nowadays, despite her efforts to summon more.
---
As other relatives fly to Minneapolis for the trial of Chauvin, LaTonya, Zsa Zsa and Williams gather in the niece's living room to watch the proceedings. They cannot help catching snippets of Floyd's final moments splayed out on Chicago Avenue. Sometimes they have to walk out.
Williams has an idea of what she'd like to say to Chauvin.
"All he asked for is air. You didn't let him breathe. When the paramedics came, you didn't even let him check his pulse. Where is your heart?"
Williams books a flight to Minneapolis for the verdict. But she falls into a depression and cannot stop crying. She doesn't go. Jurors find Chauvin guilty of second- and third-degree murder and manslaughter. Williams expected only the last one. She decides America is great that day.
For LaTonya, seeing her brother's killer led out in handcuffs is one of the happiest days of her life. Floyd is resting in peace, she thinks; Chauvin will rest in prison.
They want people to rejoice on the anniversary of Floyd's death.
"This is a victory lap," Williams says. "I feel like this is the beginning of something new. We're able to breathe just a little bit better. It's not where we want to be, but we're working towards it."
LaTonya proudly points to a photo on Williams' wall of Philonise and other relatives advocating against police brutality, saying, "There are my boys right there putting it down."
The phone rings. It's Williams' brother, Brandon, and Floyd's brother Rodney calling from California.
"What are y'all in California for?" Bianca Williams asks. "Who died from police brutality?"
Anthony McClain. He was shot in the back by Pasadena police after a traffic stop for a missing license plate.
This is new for them, keeping track of all the names. LaTonya hadn't followed police brutality
cases much before; Williams had mainly been familiar with the case of Sandra Bland, a Black woman whom authorities claim died by suicide in a Texas jail cell after she was arrested filming her own traffic stop. Now the family talks about how they have come to see this moment as bigger than Floyd: It is about Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Jacob Blake ...
---
Days later, Williams stops by the stretch of Nalle Street where she spent much of her time with her uncle. It is 11:30 on Sunday morning, and a church sermon blares down the street. Gospel music rings out around the corner.
She speaks affectionately of family memories with Floyd in the little white house. She knows her uncle would be proud of them all for standing up for him and other victims of police brutality.
"I'm not ever going to get tired," Williams vows.
Yet some days are hard. LaTonya cancels plans to be with her today, weary with grief.
Across the way is a mural on the side of a corner store where visitors frequently stop. Floyd's face looks out from a slate of blue, wings rising at his shoulders, below the words: "Forever breathing in our hearts."
It was commissioned by Floyd's childhood friend Travis Cains, who grew up with Floyd in the Cuney Homes public housing. He believed artists should paint the mural right away because, as he saw it, Chauvin had treated Floyd as if he was a nobody.
"They didn't know that he had family, that he was really loved down here," Cains says.
During the trial, he travels to the Texas statehouse to speak in favor of the George Floyd Act to increase police accountability. He goes to Floyd's grave site in nearby Pearland to talk with him sometimes.
I'm down here fighting for you, man. I got you, little bro.
Cains, 51, remembers hearing gunshots in Cuney Homes one day in 1989. He saw a slain Black man who would soon make headlines in Houston: Byron Gillum, a security guard shot by a white policeman who pulled him over for speeding and claimed he reached for a gun. Cains recalls lamenting the death with Floyd. The cop, who had killed two other Black people in recent years, was never charged.
---
From his home in the suburb of Missouri City, Cains drives east across Houston every few days to keep the mural and its surroundings tidy.
Still, fewer people are out.
Some neighbors are bereft and frightened after another of Floyd's boyhood friends is gunned down days before the anniversary events. Friends write his name on a wall next to the mural, where it is customary to record local deaths.
That evening, lawmakers and dignitaries convene to dedicate George Floyd Park a few blocks south. The sky is foreboding; the crowd is hopeful. They pray that God help them not have any more dedications in the name of those slain.
"What Derek Chauvin did was put a hole in this community," Cains tells those gathered. "He put a hole in African Americans. But it made you understand that he was godsent and that he was a sacrificial lamb for this change that is happening right now."
As grief and resolve wax and wane, relatives take turns in the public eye. Williams stays home this time, while LaTonya steps up. She walks to the platform and speaks.
"God bless you all," she says.
LaTonya accepts a certificate of congressional recognition dedicating the park. She is happy, overwhelmed with gratitude. LaTonya wipes tears from her eyes, and she and Cains embrace for a long time.

Full text: "His loss was so painful to us and sad for us. But now we can actually see it with our own eyes, even though we knew it for generations, for centuries. Now the world has stopped questioning, 'Did it really happen?' We saw it." Josie Johnson, Minneapolis, longtime civil rights activist --- "An image of a cop emerged that people thought was the truth … but didn't jibe at all with what I know from my 11 years in law enforcement. I know law enforcement as trying to protect the community, trying to save lives when we can. What was being said about me and my profession was not true." Aaron Machtemes, police officer, Eagan --- "It's a lot easier to stay complicit, to stay comfortable. But I'm past that. And a lot of other people are past that. I'm done talking to people who are just arguing with me to be right, not arguing with me to be listening." Semhar Solomon, senior at St. Anthony Village High School --- "I've launched myself into trying to read everything I could. How can we be more intentional about being anti-racist? George Floyd sent me on a quest." Dee Johnson, retired teacher, Fergus Falls --- "I feel at a low point. I keep thinking, 'How are we different now?' I don't know if I can point to how we're different." Mauri Friestleben, principal, North High School, Minneapolis --- "Seeing my daughter's ability to see the sadness in the world as well as the beauty in the world, it's a beautiful thing to watch. But it also breaks my heart. Now she gets it. She gets that people who have brown skin like hers are going to be treated differently." Rachel Hardeman, associate professor of health and racial equity in the University of Minnesota School of Public Health ? "It's really difficult to see us all painted with the same brush stroke, that we're all Derek Chauvins. … It's easy to say that law enforcement is broken. But we really have these huge societal issues in our communities. Our society is broken." Ross Litman, St. Louis County sheriff, Duluth --- "Once the verdict was read, the kids were excited. They were like, 'well, that case was good. But we need the police to stop doing this.' And then the teenage girl in Ohio got shot, one hour, two hours after that happened. They were like, 'why does this keep happening?' And I don't have the right words, or I can't explain it to them." Lacrissha Walton, fourth-grade teacher at Lucy Craft Laney Community School --- "When the murder of George Floyd happened, as always, there's a lot of interest. But that interest kind of waxes because of that, and then it wanes, because people want to be comfortable again." Tami Lee, children's librarian, Ramsey County Library --- "We got more involved in organizing, being in our community and getting more engaged." Gabby Hou, sophomore at Champlin Park High, co-founder of Minnesota Teen Activists --- "In this work, I leave feeling fulfilled every single day knowing that everything that I did for the day was for a bigger picture and was going to help really change someone's life."

George Floyd: A year of reckoning: MPD no stranger to federal investigators

Author: Jany, Libor

Full text: Federal authorities pursuing their civil rights probe of the Minneapolis Police Department bring with them a deep familiarity with the MPD's inner workings and procedures after years of concern about the department's performance.
The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether MPD officers engaged in a "pattern and practice" of violating citizens' rights, including during mental health-related calls and at last summer's protests over the murder of George Floyd. Leaders of the city's police force, which is down dozens of officers amid rising violent crime and calls for its disbandment, have said the department will cooperate with the federal probe. A separate state human rights investigation has been proceeding for months.
It's not entirely unfamiliar: The Justice Department has launched inquiries into MPD practices dating back decades, ranging from misconduct of specific officers for excessive force or corruption to mediation agreements and pledges of departmentwide reform in areas like reducing racial bias and use of force.
Late last month, city officials began issuing letters directing MPD and city department heads not to destroy any electronic data that might be relevant to the federal investigation.
In a memo obtained by the Star Tribune, Assistant City Attorney Sara Lathrop instructed officials to preserve documents "that may relate to MPD's uses of force generally and specifically as it involves individuals with behavioral health disabilities or individuals engaged in peaceful expressive activities," along with any files relating to training, supervision and investigations, complaints and discipline, among others.
Lathrop's memo asked that the department preserve documents dating to at least Jan. 1, 2010.
Some longtime MPD critics question why federal authorities didn't intervene sooner in Minneapolis.
"There's no question that the feds have been paying attention to Minneapolis for many years, and maybe some of this inertia had to do with who was in office for the past 20 years," said attorney Paul Applebaum, who over the years has filed numerous brutality lawsuits against Minneapolis officers.
In one case, a cop he sued for allegedly punching or kicking people while he was off-duty at downtown bars was eventually indicted in federal court. A jury later cleared him of most of the charges.
"It's such a boulder to roll up a hill," Applebaum said. "Just the DOJ finding the get-up-and-go to investigate MPD requires an enormous amount of institutional energy, and it takes a special climate and a special point and time for them to launch something like they did."
Lengthy history
Over the decades, federal authorities have opened cases on a succession of Minneapolis officers, with allegations ranging from excessive force and bribery to ties to a prostitution ring.
Some cases have resulted in federal grand jury indictments, but only one officer has ever gone to prison after he pleaded guilty to corruption charges in 2009.
Other times, federal authorities have made discreet inquiries about MPD officers accused of excessive force but did not open a formal investigation, according to sources familiar with those cases.
Sometimes, federal authorities have come to Minneapolis at the behest of local officials, such as in 2014 when then-chief Jane Harteau invited the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs to review her department.
The office released a 35-page report a year later urging a series of reforms, including overhauling the department's coaching program for officers, expanding racial sensitivity training and fixing the internal system for flagging potential problem officers and getting them help before any misconduct.
Two years later, the city again approached the DOJ, this time asking authorities to conduct an "after action review" of the city's response to the protests that followed the police killing of Jamar Clark.
Around the same time, Minneapolis was selected as one of six U.S. cities chosen for a federal pilot program aimed at reducing racial bias and improving relationships between law enforcement and communities.
Back in 2003, the Police Department entered into a federal mediation agreement with the DOJ aimed at addressing a host of police issues such as use of force, diversity and race relations. After some critics argued that few of the promises of reform have been kept in the years since, Chief Medaria Arradondo said he was open to revisiting the agreement.
But the department is facing its most serious challenge yet with the DOJ's latest investigation, announced last month following the conviction of ex-officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of Floyd, whose death set off waves of protests over police brutality and racial inequality.
These federal inquiries can lead to court-approved agreements, known as consent decrees, between the Justice Department and local governments that are closely monitored by judges to ensure that police departments follow through on promised reforms. But, they can also be costly and time-consuming and have a mixed record of success.
Such oversight took off under the Obama administration, which launched 25 pattern and practice investigations against troubled departments in places like Ferguson, Mo. -- the site of the 2014 fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement -- that led to 14 consent decrees. But the practice was curtailed under President Donald Trump, whose first attorney general argued that such inquiries hampered police departments' efforts to fight crime.
A week after announcing the Minneapolis probe, DOJ officials opened a similar investigation of the police department in Louisville, Ky., which came under heavy scrutiny last year after the shooting of Breonna Taylor during an unannounced raid of her apartment.
Ben Feist, chief programs officer of the Minnesota chapter of the ACLU, said that the Justice Department under President Joe Biden has signaled it will take a more aggressive approach to police reform.
He said they haven't been approached yet by the DOJ, but that he expects federal investigators to inquire about an often-cited 2015 ACLU report that found Black Minneapolitans were nearly nine times more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested for a low-level offense, often after a traffic stop.
"We will certainly see that they have a copy of our Minneapolis report, because we think it's sort of relevant in establishing a pattern," he said.
Department culture
The federal probe will likely focus on the department's actions over the past decade. A parallel DOJ investigation this month led to the indictment of Chauvin and his three former police colleagues in Floyd's death.
As part of that probe, federal investigators already gained some insight into the MPD's culture, having spent the past year interviewing various police officials, including Arradondo and most of his command staff. For instance, Deputy Chief Henry Halvorson was interviewed last July by agents from the FBI and federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office in downtown Minneapolis.
Civil rights attorney Al Goins, whose clients have often been victims of police abuse, said several of his cases seemed ripe for federal intervention.
He represented the family of Abu Jeilani, a mentally ill man who was shot and killed by police in 2002 after he refused to drop the machete and crowbar he was carrying. The death was followed by angry protests that paved the way for the federal mediation the following year.
Goins says he was also approached by federal authorities after the killing of Clark, the unarmed Black man whose death in 2015 led to a weekslong occupation of a North Side police station. Goins said that then-U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Andy Luger opened an investigation into the case but ultimately decided not to indict the officers involved -- a move that has been cited recently by critics who opposed Luger's potential reappointment to the job.
He added that he thinks the federal probe is shortsighted, in that the issues with policing don't start and end with Minneapolis.
"If they're looking at excessive force in the metro area, it's bigger than the Minneapolis Police Department. Much bigger," Goins said. "This is structural, and the structure also includes the prosecutors; it's also, to some degree, the judges. And I don't know if the Department of Justice can change all that."

Full text: There were plenty of nights over the last year when Bridgett Floyd couldn't sleep. Days when she thought she couldn't go on.
But in the year since her brother's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, she said she watched George Floyd become a catalyst for change in policing in America.
"When we say we have justice for George, we also have Black justice for families that nobody has seen behind the curtains," she said. "Cases that were swept under the rug. My brother has opened all the cases."
Floyd's family, community members, politicians, civil rights leaders and people who lost loved ones in fatal police encounters across the country gathered in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday in remembrance of Floyd just days before the anniversary of his death. They also reflected on everything that has happened since.
His killing, which was captured on bystander video, sparked worldwide protests. Policing laws and practices changed in cities and states across the nation, including Minnesota. One month ago, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of Floyd's murder, the first time in state history a white officer was found guilty of killing a Black person.
"George Floyd is not going in history as a martyr," civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton told the crowd of several hundred gathered outside the Hennepin County Government Center. "He's going in history as a game changer. When you went down on his neck, you broke the neck of police misconduct in this country."
But as leaders and families took stock of everything that has happened since the night of May 25, 2020, they pushed on what they said still needs to change.
Attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented Floyd's family, turned to the politicians in the crowd and called for action on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the U.S. House in March but has stalled in the Senate.
President Joe Biden has called on lawmakers to act on the legislation by the anniversary of Floyd's death on Tuesday.
"We must use this opportunity to get the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed," Crump said. "So we can prevent some of these unnecessary, preventable, unjustifiable, illegal and unconstitutional killings of our people."
Minnesota U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith were in the crowd Sunday, along with DFL Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter.
The debate over policing is also ongoing at the Capitol in St. Paul, where the divided Legislature is at an impasse over a dozen police accountability proposals, from reforms related to traffic stops and new no-knock warrant regulations to allowing communities to create citizen boards to provide oversight over law enforcement.
That push was reinforced for activists after the death of Daunte Wright, who was fatally shot by former Brooklyn Center police officer Kimberly Potter during a traffic stop on April 11. Wright's family sat in the front row of the remembrance on Sunday.
"The issue is implicit bias, the issue is racism, the issue is discrimination," Crump said. "We know they wouldn't have did what they did to Daunte Wright had it been a young white boy."
Outside the steps of the Government Center, which had been fortified by a massive fence and law enforcement presence during the Chauvin trial, people handed out flowers and danced to music over loud speakers. They waved signs bearing Floyd's face and lined up and marched through downtown after the rally, shouting his name.
"It's a hopeful sign for us to be optimistic, but never to be complacent," said Tylik McMillan, youth director for National Action Network. "Complacency is the enemy of accomplishment and we have so much left to accomplish."
South Side pastor Carmen Means, who is the executive director of the neighborhood organization for the area where Floyd was killed, has spent years protesting after Black Minnesotans such as Philando Castile and Jamar Clark died during encounters with police.
"What has changed? The game hasn't changed, the game remains the same," she said. "What has changed is that you have been activated on a whole 'nother level."
Since Floyd's death, his sister Bridgett started the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, which has handed out scholarships to universities and is working to raise awareness about cases like Floyd's and provide people civil rights protection.
She never expected to be thrust into this work, but she said it's what her brother would have wanted.
"That officer didn't know what he took from us last year," she said. "I will stand and be the voice for [George], I will stand and be the change for him. I will stand and continue to be the legacy for him."

Full text: Once upon a time in Minneapolis, a police officer drove through a crowded downtown intersection, aimed a can of Mace out the window, and started spraying bystanders as if they were cockroaches.
Coughing, I tweeted out a brief video of the incident on Hennepin Avenue, then went back to covering the protest last May, under the watchful eye of the Bob Dylan mural. Just another bad moment in the city's worst year.
It has been viewed millions of times since then. A 22-second statement about the relationship between police and the policed, here in the city that killed George Floyd.
A year ago Tuesday, we watched George Floyd die. We watched the people rise up in protest. We watched police meet overwhelming grief with overwhelming force. We watched Lake Street burn.
"This last year has just been a barrage of trauma for all communities," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said last week, just after a bullet killed 6-year-old Aniya Allen and just before a weekend mass shooting outside a downtown nightclub.
It is hard to move on when it feels like it is not over.
We remember the tears and the prayers, the smell of smoke and the crunch of glass underfoot. The first bright strokes of paint on the mural at the corner of 38th and Chicago. The thump-thump-thump of Blackhawk helicopters overhead. The helpers who spent weeks sweeping up broken glass and donating food to neighborhoods that had lost every grocery store within a 10-mile radius.
The deep bruises all over Terry Hempfling's body faded eventually. The memories have not.
Again and again that week, Hempfling joined the protests. She stood vigil in George Floyd Square and helped medics treating the injured near the Third Precinct police station. That Friday night, she found herself pinned against a chain-link fence near the Fifth Precinct with two other women, trying to unlock their bikes and comply with police orders to go home. There was so much tear gas in the air, she couldn't tell if the streetlights were on or off. Two police lines marched toward them, firing a hail of projectiles.
"I was in such a state of adrenaline, I didn't immediately realize we were being hit," said Hempfling, who has attended protests since she was a baby and had never experienced such violent retaliation. "We were sitting ducks right there, just trying to unlock our bikes. Me, my friend, and one other woman ... from both sides, there were lines of police coming towards us."
Hempfling and her friend vaulted over a fence to safety. The next morning, she woke to find her body covered in bruises from less-lethal projectiles -- on her back, on her breast, on her leg, where one bruise spread from her knee to her hip.
We'd like to make sure this sort of violence never happens again, but we can't even get answers about why it happened last time.
The city still has not released the name of the officer who Maced a crowd of people out exercising their constitutional rights last May, or any reports from the incident. Frey said the officer went on unpaid leave a few months later and left the force for good last month.
"I saw the same video that everyone else did and I was angered by what looks like to be a totally unnecessary escalation of a situation that was already completely escalated," Frey said.
Information about that one small incident is tangled in a web of data practice requests and contract law and Minnesota's police arbitration process that undermine the mayor and police chief when they try to discipline their own police force.
A few years ago, the mayor and chief tried to fire the officers who decked out the Fourth Precinct Christmas tree with racist garbage. An arbitrator returned one of the officers to duty last year.
"That whole Macing incident maybe only took a few seconds, but the impact on the public consciousness will be there for years," Frey said. "That particular incident, I think, is ingrained in people's memory and does so much to prevent trust from forming."
There were at least 550 complaints lodged against Minneapolis police during the first two weeks of protest following Floyd's death. The ACLU of Minnesota filed two lawsuits against the city -- one on behalf of protesters, including Hempfling; one on behalf of the press. The U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's use of force.
"We don't know when the next time the police are going to kill another Black, Indigenous or person of color from our community. But we know that's going to happen," said Isabella Nascimento, staff attorney for the ACLU of Minnesota. "We bring these cases to [ensure] when that inevitably happens, the community, protesters and the press aren't inhibited from speaking out, from doing their jobs, from voicing their concerns."
People matter. If the past year taught us anything, you'd think it would have taught us that.
But when it came time for a verdict in the Derek Chauvin murder trial, the city that killed George Floyd wrapped itself in razor wire and stationed military vehicles in the streets to protect property.
And when Daunte Wright was killed at a traffic stop -- shot to death by a Brooklyn Center police officer who apparently pulled her gun instead of her Taser -- in the middle of the Chauvin trial, police unleashed a ferocious barrage of flashbangs, projectiles and chemical munitions against protesters. They broke bones with rubber bullets.
Late last year, Hempfling left Minneapolis to care for her terminally ill father, a longtime civil rights activist. She returned last month to find the city boarded up and patrolled by National Guard troops.
"I felt terrible being here," she said. "I was really feeling like this is not a place I want to live."
But recently, she's been feeling better. She joined the ACLU lawsuit, putting herself out there once again.
Minneapolis' worst year is almost over.
Whether the next is any better is up to us.

Judge probes leaks about grand jury in Floyd's death: Two newspaper stories described the possibility of federal charges for Minneapolis officers.

Full text: A federal judge has begun an investigation into leaks to newspapers about the secret grand jury that indicted four former Minneapolis police officers on charges of violating the civil rights of George Floyd.
U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz ordered the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Minnesota attorney general to provide a list of every person to whom they disclosed grand jury activity.
He also ordered the U.S. Attorney's Office to explain why he shouldn't appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate and file criminal contempt of court charges for the disclosures. Schiltz wants the responses filed under seal no later than June 4.
At issue are stories published by the Star Tribune and the New York Times detailing the possibility of federal charges against the former police officers in Floyd's murder.
On April 29, the Star Tribune published a story with the headline, "Feds plan to indict Chauvin, three other ex-officers on civil rights charges." On Feb. 23, the New York Times published a story about the grand jury with the headline, "With New Grand Jury, Justice Department Revives Investigation Into Death of George Floyd."
The New York Times story came out days before the beginning of jury selection in the state trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck and was convicted in April of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. The three are scheduled to stand trial in state court next March.
Days after Chauvin's conviction, the Star Tribune story revealed that the Justice Department had been working to indict him on federal charges, and if he had been acquitted in state court, the feds planned to arrest him at the courthouse, the story said, citing an unidentified source.
But Chauvin was convicted in state court and on May 8, the four former officers were indicted by the federal grand jury.
In his five-page order signed May 5, Schiltz cited the U.S. Supreme Court's reasons for protecting the secrecy of grand jury proceedings: preventing the escape of those indicted, influence on deliberations, perjury or jury tampering.
"In order to safeguard the secrecy of grand jury proceedings, federal prosecutors are generally prohibited from disclosing matters occurring before a grand jury," Schiltz wrote.
In this case, federal prosecutors were given permission to provide information to Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is handling the prosecution of the four former officers. Ellison's office then was prohibited from disclosing the information for anything other than investigative or prosecutorial reasons, Schiltz noted.
Jane Kirtley, professor and director of the Silha Center for Media Ethics and Law, said Schiltz appears to be conducting an investigation to find the source of the leaks without compelling journalists to divulge their sources.
"There's always a risk they'll conclude they have no recourse other than to go to the journalists," she said. "Let's hope that doesn't become necessary."
Star Tribune Managing Editor Suki Dardarian said, "I have no comment on the court's actions, but I will say that the Star Tribune stands resolutely behind its pledge not to reveal the identities of anonymous sources."
A spokeswoman for the New York Times declined to comment.
A similar leak investigation is playing out in state court where Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill "suggested" that attorneys for all the parties file sworn affidavits attesting that they weren't the source for a New York Times story earlier in February. Cahill did not order that they must file affidavits.
In that story, the Times cited anonymous sources in reporting that in the days following Floyd's murder, Chauvin was prepared to plead guilty to third-degree murder and go to prison for more than 10 years but then-U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr rejected the deal.
In a hearing in the state case last week, a frustrated Cahill said he first asked attorneys in February to voluntarily file affidavits and was disappointed that only Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank had complied. Cahill strongly encouraged attorneys last week to follow suit, prompting Frank and Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Joshua Larson to say they would provide affidavits for their offices.
Many attorneys have submitted sworn and notarized affidavits in the state case. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, however, submitted a general letter saying no one in his office was the source of the leak.
Freeman's office said Friday that he will not file a sworn affidavit.
"The Hennepin County Attorney's Office has informed the court that our office was not the source of any information 'leak' to the New York Times," said a statement from Freeman's office. "Whether it is in the form of a letter or affidavit, County Attorney Mike Freeman has addressed the issue personally and on behalf of his office. At this point, our office feels that we have satisfied the court's request."
Ellison filed a sworn affidavit Friday. Ellison's spokesman, John Stiles, said Friday that they would also file affidavits in the federal matter.
A spokeswoman from the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment.

Full text: Three days of events</URL> will take place in downtown Minneapolis to commemorate the anniversary of George Floyd's death, which marked an inflection point in the movement for Black lives in Minneapolis and around the world.
From May 23 to 25, the George Floyd Memorial Foundation will hold a rally in front of the Hennepin County Government Center, panel discussions about translating 2020's season of protest into lasting policy changes and a celebration of life with food, inflatables and performances by gospel star Le'Andria Johnson as well as local musicians in the Commons park.
The foundation was created by Floyd's sister, Bridgett Floyd.
While Floyd's family has endured much pain in the past year, they also received "some triumph" through their record $27 million settlement with the city and the conviction of Derek Chauvin on all three charges, foundation director Jacari Harris said at a virtual news conference Thursday.
accountable, our elected officials accountable. It is time to ensure that we bring healing and unity within the community," he said.
That includes taking stock of what has really changed since Floyd's death, Harris went on.
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a raft of police reforms under deliberation in Congress, has not yet passed.
Scores of unarmed Black people, including Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center and Andre Hill in Columbus, Ohio, have been killed by police since Floyd.
"I really thought my brother's death would be the last police brutality case, but as we can all see, they are at it again and again and again," Bridgett Floyd said.
"We are human beings. We bleed the same way they bleed. The same breath God put in our body, he puts in their body."
The George Floyd Memorial Foundation events will be held in downtown Minneapolis.
There will be food, music and a candlelight vigil from 1-9 p.m. Tuesday at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, where Floyd took his last breath.
That event is organized by the George Floyd Global Memorial, founded by Jeanelle Austin, a lead occupier of the semi-autonomous zone known as George Floyd Square.
Worldwide Outreach for Christ, the longtime church at the intersection, also will have a cookout.

A year later, the boards are back: "Justice for George" memorial will exhibit murals from the uprising for the first time.

Full text: It's been nearly a year since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police. Boarded-up storefronts, buildings set aflame and days of protests are burned into people's minds and hearts.
For Leesa Kelly, Kenda Zellner-Smith and Tina Burnside, last May's uprising sparked a mission they hope to pursue for years to come.
Zellner-Smith and Kelly both started collecting the plywood murals that artists painted with messages of solidarity, portraits of Floyd and demands for an end to racialized violence and inequality. They soon joined forces under the banner Save the Boards to Memorialize the Movement with the support of Burnside, of the Minnesota African-American Heritage Museum and Gallery.
This weekend, 86 of the preserved murals will be on display at "Justice for George: Messages From the People," an event at Phelps Field Park, just a block from where Floyd died, to give the community a space to remember and grieve.
"We want people to really reflect on what happened," said Burnside. "The art was created because George Floyd was murdered. We want people to ask what they can do to bring about change. To fight for racial justice."
Zellner-Smith, Kelly and their crew of more than 40 volunteers have preserved nearly 900 boards, storing them
at the Northrup King building in northeast Minneapolis while raising around $60,000 to support the effort.
Kelly said the organizers "know it is going to be a heavy exhibit, that it will bring up a lot of trauma and grief. But we also want this to be an opportunity to talk about our trauma and process as a community, and talk about ways we can make positive changes so that this doesn't happen again."
Envisioned as an annual remembrance, the exhibition will run Friday through Sunday. Since it will be especially painful for Black people, the event also offers a space of healing and positive processing, staffed by mental health professionals who are people of color. That includes Free in Color Arts, an organization that provides creative programming to explore identity, community and culture for people of color and immigrant backgrounds.
As many as 18 artists will be present to paint new boards, calling for a continuation of the movement. Arts organizations such as Creatives After Curfew, the artist collective that painted through the uprising, will have a table at the event. Performers, speakers and musicians will also participate.
"We are hoping allies and non-Black people come into this space and get a glimpse to see what it's like to be us, even if only for a second, and we hope that glimpse changes them," said Kelly. "We hope they give themselves to this movement in the same way Black people don't have the choice not to do."
The event is not "sugarcoated or dumb-downed for non-BIPOC people to take in," added Zellner-Smith.
After all, the killings haven't stopped. A new influx of boards popped up around the Twin Cities after a Brooklyn Center police officer fatally shot Daunte Wright during a routine traffic stop just days before former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder in Floyd's death.
But this weekend's event is also about making sure Floyd is humanized, not just a hashtag.
"What was his favorite food? What was his favorite thing to do on the weekends?" said Zellner-Smith. "We want to make sure that people feel heard and supported. ... That these artifacts are saved for the BIPOC community, and that the narrative is told -- that it's not just a pretty story."

VANDAL STRIKES FLOYD SQUARE AGAIN: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA CAPTURED THE "UNFORTUNATE ACT OF VANDALISM."

Full text: An ax-wielding man was captured on video vandalizing displays and a structure at George Floyd Square in south Minneapolis late at night over the weekend.
The damage occurred about 2 a.m. Sunday at 38th and Chicago, the intersection that has been an informal gathering place and remembrance since Floyd was killed by police May 25, 2020.
"This was particularly upsetting that this would happen after the historic trial and the upcoming memorial," said LaToya Evans, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit that is organizing a celebration of Floyd's life on the anniversary of his killing by convicted murderer Derek Chauvin.
Evans said repairs have been made after "this unfortunate act of vandalism."
The surveillance video showed a man arriving in a pickup truck and striding toward the square, where he tore down signs and threw items out of a shed.
He then retrieved an ax from his pickup bed and took several whacks at the brightly colored shed before someone shouted at him to leave.
The man looked over his shoulder as he returned to the pickup, got in and sped off. But he left behind his ax -- and presumably, his fingerprints.
Marcia Howard, who helps manage the square, said in a TikTok posting that "the memorial wasn't destroyed. We were watching. If you notice, our video was tracking him. ... Listen, we're still here. We're still holding it down. No justice, no street."
The man has yet to be identified and left no apparent clues about his motive.
Some neighborhood residents and others who have visited the commercial and residential intersection over the years have expressed frustration that it has been closed to private and transit vehicles for nearly a year.
Mayor Jacob Frey has said he favors a "phased reopening" of the square that would include a Floyd memorial because he has heard from residents and business owners who want it reopened.
Police spokesman John Elder said Wednesday that the incident has yet to be reported to police.
"If there was a report, we absolutely would investigate," he said.
Elder dismissed any notion that the Minneapolis Police Department is purposely ignoring the vandalism because of any perception that officers are unwelcome in the square or that it features anti-police graffiti.
"We don't use our services as a tool to act out against people who don't like us," he said.
Vandals have targeted the square in the past year. In April, a billboard promoting nonviolence at the site was transformed into a pro-violence message when someone covered up the prefix "non" in the phrase "Don't let anyone convince you that nonviolence is ineffective."
A mural painted on the side of Cup Foods, where Floyd was killed, has been defaced multiple times but continues to be preserved by the square's caretakers.

Full text: Friends and family of George Floyd will gather for a daylong celebration of his life Tuesday to commemorate one year since he was killed by Minneapolis police.
The event at 38th and Chicago in south Minneapolis is hosted by the George Floyd Global Memorial. It will begin at 1 p.m. on May 25 and will include local and community art and children's activities, along with an open mic session and concerts featuring Sounds of Blackness and DJ Sophia Eris at 6 p.m.
The event will end with a candlelight vigil honoring Floyd at 8 p.m. at the site where he was killed.
"George Floyd Square and the George Floyd Global Memorial were built by members of the community who wanted to preserve the site where my nephew lost his life," Floyd's aunt and Minneapolis resident Angela Harrelson said in a statement. "On the anniversary of his death, we will celebrate the impact of his life on our family, friends, the community and our society."
The George Floyd Global Memorial is a nonprofit established by Harrelson, her cousin Paris Stevens and lead caretaker Jeanelle Austin to bring together members of Floyd's family and the local community to preserve more than 2,500 artistic tributes by community members at the intersection where Floyd was killed.
"Everywhere you look, people have created something that reflects the current moment, the actual spot where George was murdered," read a statement from Minneapolis mural artist Peyton Scott Russell. "There's flowers with notes and trinkets and things that just reflect people's offerings. Everyone in Minneapolis processed George Floyd's death differently."
The area, which remains blocked off from traffic, serves as an ongoing protest and memorial site and has been visited by thousands of people from around the world.
Mayor Jacob Frey said he favors a "phased reopening" of the square that would include a Floyd memorial because he has heard from residents and business owners who want it reopened.

Full text: Natalie Quiring-Oleson considered herself open-minded about race. But George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis police exposed what she calls her "blinds spots" about racism. She began reading books, such as "How to be an Antiracist" by Ibram X. Kendi. She listened to podcasts and watched documentaries, including "13th." And Quiring-Oleson, a social worker at Jewish Family and Children's Service of Minneapolis, channeled her soul searching into an article titled, "How to talk to your white kids about racism." She reflects below on her childhood, her desire to play even a small part in deconstructing structural racism and why it's OK for parents to embrace their shortcomings.
Q: What did you discover about yourself in the process of writing this article?
A: Most of my blind spots originated in my upbringing and my education. I am a white person. I was raised in St. Cloud by very well-meaning, liberal parents that were middle class and comfortable. And we didn't talk about this stuff. This was a time when "color blindness" was the goal: Treat everybody the same and everything would be fine. I went through my adulthood thinking that was good enough. I didn't outwardly hold overtly racist views. And even when I think back to what my school taught me, it sort of made me think that racism was over. You study slavery, you do your two or three days on the civil rights movement, but you didn't talk about anything of the racism that exists today.
Q: Is that why you wanted to write a how-to for parents? To get people talking?
A: Nothing against my parents; they were just doing what they thought was right. But I do believe that if I had been raised talking about this, I would have known more. I kind of put that hat on and said, Let me just talk to other white people. When is it appropriate to talk about racism and centuries of injustice and unfair laws? Well, all of that is really a privileged way to think. You get to decide when, if ever, to talk about systemic racism with your kids. But communities of color don't have that option. Police were never scary to me. They were helpful. That is not the case in many, many other homes where kids have to learn all these rules. I was never told rules. It's embarrassing to say now. I just didn't know. I didn't understand.
Q: So, how do you talk to your white kids about racism?
A: Start by educating yourself. This is the same whether you're talking to your kids about sex, divorce, depression or any other difficult conversation. Ignorance and racism go hand-in-hand. If you don't really understand it yourself, there's no way you can easily explain it. And start small. It's OK to talk to your toddlers about diversity. But explaining systemic racism to a 2-year-old is probably not going to work.
Q: What makes it so scary?
A: Parents think they have to have all of the answers. Don't let your own discomfort keep your children ignorant. Do some research together or say you don't know. That's a great thing for a kid to hear: I am not sure why people made these choices, but they did. Now we're here. It's always OK to circle back to something. Parents think that if they don't say it absolutely perfectly the first time, they're out of luck. It's OK to say, "I thought more about that and I forgot to say this." Expect questions. Whether it's that day or the following week, your kid is going to think about this and stew on it and they're going to come back to you and want to talk more.
Q: So, keep the conversation going?
A: The best way to raise anti-racist kids is to be anti-racist yourself. Are all of their toys white? Are all of their books white? Do you show them movies that portray people of color? Do you have people in your life who are not white? Do you have them spend time with other kids who are not white? All of those things you can start doing from birth. Maybe when you're watching a TV show and all the characters are white people, casually bring that up with your child. Or if there is a Black person on screen, how are they portrayed? Is that good? Is that not so good? It can come out in all of these other non-obvious, non-direct ways. All of us carry some racial bias. Anti-racism is the active process of noticing, addressing and correcting racism.
Q: How can oversimplifying things harm the way kids understand racism?
A: We sometimes try to present the world in absolute terms to kids, because it's easier. I've heard people say, "It's bad guys who steal stuff." But at some point we're going to have to complicate that. Because it's not only bad people who steal things. Lots of people end up breaking laws. Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were breaking laws because they were unjust laws. Explain to your kids that bad laws get changed because brave people break them, and are often punished for doing so. George Floyd was suspected of breaking a law. But I still don't believe he deserved to be murdered for it. The world is not one or the other, people are not all good or all bad. Good people do bad things all the time.
Q: What has it been like for you to step into this difficult subject so publicly?
A: After the article came out, I was asked to give a workshop with a colleague on how to raise anti-racist children. It felt a little odd. I will never be an expert on racism or anti-racism. It is not my lived experience and it will never be my lived experience. I don't want to be at the forefront of anything. But I also don't want to throw up my hands and say I can't do anything, either. It's not 100% on Black people to educate us about racism.
Q: Some readers will be disappointed that you don't offer more specifics.
A: The feedback from the workshop was that we had spent too much time on education. I think there were parents who thought I was going to hand them a script: "This is what you start by saying." You know your kid better than I do. You have to trust that you will know how to do it. I can give you some general guidelines. But you work by knowledge and intuition, which is so much of parenting anyway, no matter the subject.
Q: Beyond finding ways to talk to their children, what else can parents do?
A: I think our educational systems are becoming a lot more aware and hopefully it's shifting. But if all your kid is learning about is Dr. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, while those are two very important people, that is not the whole story. I had a client who is part Native American. On Columbus Day or Thanksgiving, she heard her kindergartner was learning about it in a very whitewashed way. She sent an e-mail to the teacher and said, "This is upsetting my child." And the teacher was quite receptive to it, saying, "I should be teaching this in a different way." So even getting involved with the school system can be helpful.
Q: Are there other helpful resources you can suggest?
A: A website called booksforlittleones.com has a great "Anti-Racism for Kids 101." EmbraceRace.org has a list of diverse books aimed at children. An article in USA Today provides a helpful explainer on microagressions. Many articles have been written highlighting books for adults, but I like the one in New York Magazine's, the Strategist. I also found "The New Jim Crow" by Michelle Alexander and "Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?" by Beverly Tatum to be great resources.

2022 trial for ex-cops charged in Floyd case: Federal indictments on civil rights issues spurs the August trial's delay.

Full text: The trial for three ex-Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd has been postponed to next year following their indictment on federal civil rights charges.
J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao will stand trial on March 7, 2022, instead of Aug. 23 of this year. The rescheduling was announced at a motion hearing Thursday. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said the federal case should proceed first and that the state trial needed "space" from events this summer, including the June 25 sentencing of ex-officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted three weeks ago of murdering Floyd.
Attorneys for Kueng, Lane and Thao did not object to the new date. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank said he disagreed with the delay, but did not elaborate.
All four former officers were indicted last week by a federal grand jury on charges of abusing their positions of authority to detain Floyd. According to the charges, the officers used the "color of the law" to deprive Floyd of his constitutional rights to be "free from the use of unreasonable force" when Chauvin used his knee to pin down Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes last May 25 while the other three did nothing to stop him. A federal trial has not yet been scheduled.
Jurors convicted Chauvin in state court of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Thursday's hearing also touched on other key issues: An evidentiary hearing was scheduled for August so defense attorneys can question a New York Times reporter, and possibly prosecutors, regarding a leak to the New York Times about early plea negotiations with Derek Chauvin.
Thao's attorneys, Bob and Natalie Paule, filed a motion in February seeking a dismissal of the charges against their client and sanctions against prosecutors for the New York Times leak, which was published a few weeks before Chauvin's trial began March 8. Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, and Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, joined Thao's motion.
Bob Paule argued Thursday that the leak harmed his client's right to a fair trial through association with Chauvin. He said the Minnesota Attorney General's Office was likely the source of the leak because the New York Times reporter who wrote the story, Timothy Arango, had met with Gray, and in that meeting Arango had a copy of a prosecution court document that had not yet been publicly filed. Bob Paule called the leak "the single most outrageous" incident of misconduct he's seen in his legal career.
Frank accused the defense of making a "public spectacle" of the issue in an effort to taint the jury pool and further its ongoing push for a change of venue. Cahill has denied a change of venue and noted Thursday that the trial would not be relocated.
Frank said he was "sick to my stomach" over the leak. " … We didn't authorize that leak," he said. "We didn't give that leak."
Cahill said he had a private discussion in February with defense attorneys and prosecutors about the issue and had "suggested" that prosecutors provide affidavits to the court swearing under oath that they did not leak the information. Cahill said Thursday it was "disappointing" that only Frank had submitted an affidavit.
The judge said he had hoped other prosecutors would have followed suit to avoid the "circus" of defense attorneys subpoenaing prosecutors to testify on the matter at a public hearing.
Bob Paule noted that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sent the judge a letter about the leak and suggested affidavits, but did not submit a sworn affidavit.
"Why did the Attorney General's Office not provide the affidavits to clear this up immediately?" Cahill asked Frank. " … The defense would not leak such a thing."
"I don't agree with that," Frank said.
Frank did not say why Ellison and others did not submit affidavits but noted that the court had given them a May 15 deadline. He declined to comment after the hearing. Frank also suggested in court that Cahill was shifting the burden of proof onto prosecutors. The judge rejected the claim and said defense attorneys will be responsible for investigating their accusations.
Cahill said he believed the leak came from the U.S. Department of Justice since the article focused on how then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr handled the plea negotiations.
"This is a particularly pernicious issue," Cahill said of the leak.
After several rounds of back and forth and escalating frustration from the judge, Frank and Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Joshua Larson said they would seek affidavits from other attorneys in their offices, including Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.
Without declaring a specific date, Cahill granted Bob Paule's request for an all-day evidentiary hearing, scheduled for August, to investigate the leak. If prosecutors don't voluntarily provide the court a sworn affidavit, Cahill said, it is "fair game" for defense attorneys to subpoena them to testify. Cahill said Arango can also be subpoenaed, adding that he is "unlikely" to issue a court order asking Arango to reveal his sources.
The New York Times pushed back on the hearing.
"Minnesota law protects reporters from exactly these kinds of subpoenas," said New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha. "The New York Times will vigorously defend against any effort to target our reporters and their sources."
Cahill, who previously served as chief deputy of the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, said that had the leak originated with a staffe,r they should face stiff consequences.
"If I were still the chief deputy of that office, I would be firing that person," the judge said.
Plunkett accused the state of leaking information to WCCO-TV Wednesday that the trial was being postponed. "The leaks in this case have been rampant and they consistently have been from the government," he said.
Earlier in the hearing, Gray asked Cahill to compel prosecutors to produce 30 years' of internal affairs use-of-force reports so he could prove that officers historically have not intervened when colleagues allegedly acted out. Kueng and Thao's attorneys also joined Gray's request.
"It's extremely important in my client's case," Gray said. "He was four days on the job."
Officers are told there's a policy to intervene, but they receive no training or scenario-based instruction on how to intervene, Gray told the court.
Frank said the issue is how Lane -- not other officers -- behaved.
"It's an excessive, burdensome request," Frank said. "The bottom line is it's not likely to produce relevant, admissible evidence."
Cahill instructed Frank to ask Minneapolis police how many such reports they had for a five-year and 10-year period before he considers Gray's request.
The judge said he did not necessarily believe that Gray had a right to receive 30 years' of reports and noted that policing standards have changed over time.

Stiffer sentence likely for Chauvin: Judge points to abuse of authority, "particular cruelty" in treatment of Floyd ahead of sentencing.

Full text: The judge in Derek Chauvin's murder trial characterized the killing of George Floyd late last spring as especially cruel in his finding of several aggravated sentencing factors, clearing the way for him to exceed state guidelines and impose a longer sentence for the fired Minneapolis police officer.
In rulings filed Wednesday that embraced many of the major prosecution points that led to Chauvin's conviction last month, Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said the facts of the case showed there are four aggravated factors that "have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt" and will be considered when he sentences Chauvin on June 25.
Those factors are that Chauvin "abused a position of trust and authority" as a police officer, that he "treated George Floyd with particular cruelty," that children were present when Floyd was pinned to the pavement at 38th and Chicago for more than nine minutes until he died, and that he committed the crime with the "active participation" of others, namely three fellow officers.
Chauvin, 45, was convicted April 20 on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in connection with Floyd's death on May 25. Defense attorney Eric Nelson declined to comment on Cahill's rulings.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who put together the team that prosecuted Chauvin, said in a statement, "We appreciate the court agreed with our assessment of the aggravating factors. The particular cruelty of Derek Chauvin's conduct, his abuse of authority with his fellow officers and the impact of this crime on the minors who had to witness it require a sentence that holds Mr. Chauvin sufficiently accountable."
Although the maximum term for a second-degree murder conviction is 40 years, the most Chauvin could receive would be 30 years, given that he has no previous criminal history, according to Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law and an appellate criminal defense attorney. The first 20 years would be served in prison and the balance on supervised release, if Chauvin qualifies.
"The judge basically threw the book at him," said Minneapolis defense attorney Joe Tamburino.
"Obviously, Mr. Chauvin is going to get a lot more time than what the guidelines call for," in this case 12 ½ years, Tamburino said. "I think the judge is going to give him 30 years."
University of St. Thomas Law Prof. Rachel Moran said Cahill's choice of language "does not paint a hopeful picture for Mr. Chauvin. The judge uses the word 'egregious' twice to describe Mr. Chauvin's behavior and notes that Mr. Chauvin's behavior was particularly cruel because he remained indifferent while George Floyd begged for his life in obvious terror."
Moran added that "Judge Cahill's order is interesting because it's the first window we've really had into what the judge himself thinks about the evidence against Mr. Chauvin."
In finding abuse of trust and authority as an aggravated factor, the judge cited Chauvin holding Floyd to the pavement handcuffed in the prone position for "an inordinate amount of time" while knowing of the danger of positional asphyxia.
"The prolonged use of this technique was particularly egregious in that George Floyd made it clear he was unable to breathe," Cahill wrote, "and expressed the view that he was dying as a result of the officers' restraint."
As far as Chauvin's treatment of Floyd, Cahill explained, "The slow death of George Floyd occurring over approximately six minutes of his positional asphyxia was particularly cruel in that Mr. Floyd was begging for his life and obviously terrified by the knowledge that he was likely to die but during which the Defendant objectively remained indifferent to Mr. Floyd's pleas."
David Schultz, law professor at the University of Minnesota and a political science professor at Hamline University, said after reading Cahill's rulings that "given the fact of a cluster of aggravated factors, the only question now is how much will [Cahill] depart" from sentencing guidelines.
Schultz said that having four aggravated factors "is a really high number. Theoretically, he would only need one to do a departure."
He also believes that Cahill listed the abuse of authority first and dedicated more than two pages to that section for a reason beyond the sentencing. "He wants to send a signal to other officers," Schultz said, " 'That if you want to do anything like this, look at what I did to Chauvin [at sentencing].' "
Not proven to Cahill as an aggravated factor was that Floyd was "particularly vulnerable," because although he was handcuffed, he was able to resist arrest before he was placed in the prone position, nor was his drug intoxication a factor as the defense had contended.
"Restraining George Floyd in the prone position with the weight of three police officers on him for a prolonged period did not create a vulnerability that was exploited to cause death," Cahill wrote. "It was the actual mechanism [the restraint] causing death."
Chauvin had been out on bond throughout his trial. But once the jurors found him guilty, Chauvin's bond was revoked, and he was handcuffed and taken to the Oak Park Heights Prison, where he remains until sentencing.
Taken in whole, Cahill's nearly 5 ½-page filing summed up much of the prosecution's case against Chauvin that led to guilty verdicts on all three counts after deliberating over two days.
Like the prosecution, Cahill noted how Chauvin's restraint of Floyd was not part of police training and that asphyxiation was the cause of death and not a combination of health problems and drug abuse, as the defense argued.
Regarding abuse of authority, Cahill said that Chauvin's "failure to render aid became particularly abusive after Mr. Floyd had passed out, and was still being restrained in the prone position, with the Defendant continuing to kneel on the back of Mr. Floyd's neck with one knee and on his back with another knee, for more than two and a half minutes after one of his fellow officers announced he was unable to detect a pulse."
In finding Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, the judge said without qualification that "Mr. Floyd had … made it clear he was having trouble breathing." During the trial, the defense suggested multiple times that Floyd could have been misleading police in order to avoid arrest when he repeatedly said, "I can't breathe."
Cahill's explanations throughout the ruling "pretty much mirrored what the prosecution had been presenting throughout the trial," Schultz said. "At the end of the day, it's clear that had he been the trier of fact, he would have reached the same conclusion as to a finding of guilt."
Fellow fired officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are scheduled to be tried Aug. 23 for aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. All three are out on bond.
Cahill elaborated in Wednesday's ruling that his referencing the "active participation" of Kueng, Lane and Thao constitutes "no finding [by the court] that they are 'offenders' subject to criminal liability."
In a separate ruling Wednesday afternoon, Cahill decided there would be no audio and video coverage allowed during pretrial hearings for the remaining three defendants.

Full text: The Star Tribune took six first-place prizes Wednesday in one of the oldest and largest annual contests recognizing journalistic excellence in the United States.
The National Headliner Awards recognized the Star Tribune for both its coverage of George Floyd's death and the aftermath, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. The Headliner Awards were founded in 1934 by the Press Club of Atlantic City, N.J.
"It has been a uniquely challenging year for our newsroom, but these national honors reflect how devoted our staff is to serving the public with compelling, vital journalism," Star Tribune Editor Rene Sanchez said.
The Star Tribune and the Los Angeles Times were top winners in the contest, with six first-place awards each.
Star Tribune staff members were awarded first place in the Breaking News daily newspaper category for coverage of Floyd's death on Memorial Day 2020, which occurred after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.
The death of Floyd, a Black man, was filmed by a bystander and posted on social media, prompting widespread unrest in the Twin Cities and a global reckoning on race. A Hennepin County jury last month returned two murder convictions against Chauvin, who is white.
Headliner judges said the Star Tribune "demonstrated why journalists and journalism are critical to a community," and stated that the newspaper's journalists "provided multilayered, contextual coverage even as they were targeted by protesters and the police."
Star Tribune reporter Libor Jany, who covers the Minneapolis police, won a first-place award for local news beat coverage in a top 20 media market. The judges said Jany "exemplifies beat coverage," noting he was the first to tweet both Floyd and Chauvin's names in "what would become an international story."
Jany's work, judges said, went beyond "that increasingly beaten path, and found stories and people that speak to his city's other failings. Beautifully written, and meaningful."
The Star Tribune's photojournalists won a first-place award for their work in documenting Floyd's death and its aftermath, telling "a story of rage, fury, confrontation and sadness."
Digital designer Anna Boone was awarded first place for "One Week in Minneapolis," an online presentation documenting the fallout following Floyd's death. The judges called her efforts "clear-eyed storytelling in an unconventional format. Exceptionally well done."
Members of the digital staff -- Colleen Kelly, Alexis Allston and Boone -- won first place for their coverage of Floyd's murder on social media, "capturing history in real time."
Other work by Star Tribune staffers also won recognition. Photojournalist Richard Tsong-Taatarii won a first-place award for a multiple-day photo story documenting the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and South Dakota. Tsong-Taatarii also won a third-place award for an individual photo portfolio.
Reporters Chris Serres and Glenn Howatt won a second-place award for pandemic coverage documenting the COVID-19 outbreak at the North Ridge Health and Rehab facility in New Hope, and Reid Forgrave won a second-place award for feature writing on a variety of subjects.
Earlier this year, the Star Tribune won a prestigious George Polk Award, a Scripps Howard Award and an Online Journalism Award for its reporting of Floyd's death and the resulting fallout.
"We are proud of our news staff's work this past year as they served our community," said Suki Dardarian, the Star Tribune's senior managing editor. "And it is a great honor to see that work valued by our peers in journalism."

Ex-Best Buy CEO's quest for 'human magic': Hubert Joly has a new book out as he forges his next chapter

Full text: When former CEO Hubert Joly decided to step down from his role as Best Buy's executive board chairman last year, he had his choice of options.
Joly said he didn't want to move down to Florida and retire "to play golf with aging white men." He also didn't want to become a chief executive again, at least for now, even after the success he found leading the revitalization of Best Buy and his earlier experience heading Twin Cities-based Carlson Cos.
Instead, much like former Medtronic CEO Bill George, he decided teaching and mentoring current and future business leaders would be more fulfilling. Joly works as a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School in addition to serving on the boards of Johnson & Johnson and Ralph Lauren Corp.
His new book, "The Heart of Business," is a guide on how businesses and even individuals can stage a turnaround similar to what he did at Best Buy by becoming purpose driven, people focused and spreading love.
"I wanted the next chapter of my life to matter, to continue to make a difference, and I took the time to reflect," said Joly, 61, who still has a home in Minnesota but spends much of his time in New York City. "I wanted to add my voice and my energy to what many believe is a necessary refoundation of business and capitalism around purpose and humanity."
Joly is donating what he earns from the book, published by the Harvard Business Review Press, to Best Buy Teen Tech Centers.
The following are excerpts from an interview with Joly, edited for length and clarity.
Q: Why do you think the way we look at the concept of work needs to change?
A: Why do we work? Is work punishment? Is it something we do so that we can do something else, or is it part of our quest for meaning, part of our fulfillment? Of course we need the money, it's not about ignoring that. But what gives you energy? Is it just a paycheck or is it something more?
As human beings, in our hearts, we have a desire to do something good for other people. I think that is what's common in all of humanity. Even Darth Vader in "Star Wars," you still say there's some good in him. That's my belief, that in my heart we have a desire to do something good for others. It's the same in business, and I learned that from a client, that the purpose of a corporation is not to make money. It's imperative like earning a salary: You need it, but that's not the ultimate goal. My view is that with any human activity the ultimate goal is to contribute to the common good, do something good for others. That's a much healthier idea.
Q: How do you think "human magic" and love can give businesses a competitive advantage?
A: People are much more than a resource or some human capital, they are the source. I think our role as leaders is to create an environment where "human magic" can be unleashed, which is what I've seen at Best Buy. People talk about loved brands where you have an emotional connection. You are not just buying because the product is cheap or solid. There is something beyond that.
When I joined Best Buy in 2012, people thought we were going to die. It was not great. Now fast forward to a couple of years ago. There was a woman who walks into one of our stores with her child. The child has a "sick" T-Rex because the head was dismantled from the body. In any normal store, they would have been pointed to the direction of the toy aisle, and with some luck the mother could have bought a replacement. At that store on that day, there were two blue shirt associates who saw what was going on and understood it and took the "sick" dinosaur and went behind a counter and started performing a surgical procedure. When the kid gets the cured dinosaur, you can't imagine the joy of the child and the mother.
Do you think there was a standard operating procedure with how to deal with "sick" dinosaurs? The two associates found it in their hearts to do this amazing thing for the child, felt they had the authority, the autonomy to do this and probably in the process created a customer for life. This was how you build loved brands. This is how you find meaning in your work. This is how you build these amazing relationships.
Q: As you left Best Buy last summer, the country was in the thick of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. How do you think Best Buy as a company responded to the crisis?
A: I was executive chairman of the board at the time. The way that [Best Buy CEO Corie Barry] led was and is fabulous. Yes, I was close to her at the time; we had board calls like every week. Here's what I love in terms of what she did. She had clear principles. The safety of the employees and the customers was first. They delayed furloughs for as long as humanly possible so that the federal program would kick in so that the team would have the time to explain to the employees how the furlough actually works and make sure we came out of this stronger, meaning let's not do anything stupid that's going to help the short term but harm the long term.
She came up with these principles that are very purpose driven, values driven and empowered her team to make decisions.
Q: How do you think the COVID crisis will affect the retail industry for the long term?
A: If I can use an analogy, it's a little bit like planet Earth had been hit by an asteroid 66 million years ago. The dinosaurs died and then you had new species thrive. And I think that in retail, as we come out of COVID, it's not a restart it's a reset. You have to reimagine your business around the needs of your customers you are trying to serve, the purpose you are trying to serve. You have to focus on and plan where the puck is going and you have to reconfigure, reimagine and refocus.
With technology, there are so many things you can do. As you know last quarter for Best Buy, about 44% of the revenue was from online sales. It's not easy to do because you have to imagine and design for the future, but there's no way that you can go back to what it was before. You would be a dinosaur. One of the great things I think about the Best Buy story is that we had said: We are not a consumer electronics retailer. We are a company whose purpose is enriching lives through technology. That leads us to do many more things that you can do in stores but also online and in people's homes. I think stores have a role to play.
Q: Should CEOs and companies speak out about societal issues and current events like inequality and what happened in the police killing of George Floyd?
A: It is a responsibility. At Best Buy, we have been on this journey for a number of years. We are not perfect. There is a before and after George Floyd. This is not the first time a Black man was killed by police, but it was so extreme and caught on video and it provoked a reaction. You can say [changes] should have been made 40 years ago or 100 years, but something happened.
Not only in people's heads are they convinced that we need to end this systemic racism, but now it's in their hearts and in their guts. So many people, myself included, began a more personal journey to more deeply understand the experience of the Black man or woman in America and realized we need to stop this. Companies have made commitments, public commitments. Boards are holding management teams accountable. In America, once a business decides something is important, we know how to get things done. The reason why we have not made more progress as a country is because [systemic racism] was not deemed that important and now it feels like it is really seen as critical and there's accountability and you see [companies] really doing the work.
Q: What's next for you?
A: I don't want to be the CEO anymore. I feel like I can have more impact with coaching and mentoring a number of CEOs and senior executives. At Harvard, I can impact hundreds if not thousands of future leaders and at the HEC Paris [business school] where I am also involved. At Best Buy, when I was there, I could impact 100,000 people directly, but here I can impact multiple companies. I think there's a time for everything. I've been a CEO and happy, but I have a different desire in my heart today.

Leading AG's office on new path: Ellison's focus on criminal justice, police, hate crimes draws national attention.

Full text: Derek Chauvin's murder conviction represented for many a rare moment of justice in the nation's long history of police brutality. It also underscored the dramatic transformation of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office under Keith Ellison.
Long focused on consumer protection, the office is rapidly becoming a major player in criminal justice in the state -- a shift that is attracting national attention.
"We definitely want to be there to direct more criminal prosecutions, and we need more people so we can meet more needs," said Ellison, who is asking the Legislature for 11 new prosecutors to rebuild its criminal division this year.
Since taking office more than two years ago, Ellison has helped lead a task force on deadly police encounters that produced new reform proposals. He also is reviving efforts to study hate crimes amid rising reports of bias attacks against Asian Americans. And his office is leading new initiatives on post-conviction reviews and expungement -- a practice that means a criminal record is sealed or erased in the eyes of the law.
"If this is the next wave of the civil rights movement for this country, if you will, then he's a key player in that," Gov. Tim Walz said.
Ellison's recent success in the courtroom has led to
calls from community activists for his office to take on more police prosecutions. His influence among the nation's attorneys general also is on the rise.
"Life is going to change for him," said former Supreme Court Justice Paul Anderson, who is a member of a conviction review unit Ellison started. "He's going to be more prominent with his leadership [nationally], and he is going to be asked to weigh in on critical issues."
Anderson added, "What he has to say now has increasing weight and I will be interested to see how he handles it."
Ellison said in an interview that while he won't rule out running for another office one day, he remains focused on the job he has now.
Although the three other ex-officers involved in George Floyd's death are awaiting trial, Chauvin's conviction already is carrying broader implications for Ellison.
Sean Rankin, executive director of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, said the verdict is spurring his organization to double down on "recruiting, supporting and electing more Democratic attorneys general across the country." More than 30 state AG races are on the ballot next year, including Ellison's.
"The election of Keith Ellison to Minnesota Attorney General in 2018 contributed directly to Derek Chauvin being held accountable for the murder of George Floyd and provided a sign of hope to millions of Americans -- especially communities of color -- that those in power can move our country farther along the path towards justice and fairness for all," Rankin said in a statement. "That is a political investment that generates a return for every American."
Ellison's decision to add more severe charges against Chauvin and to charge the other three officers -- each scheduled for trial in August -- was far from a slam dunk before last month's conviction.
Richard Allyn, a former chief deputy attorney general who helped Ellison transition into office in 2019, was struck by how Ellison stood by his charging decisions and remained publicly attached to the case throughout the process.
"A lot of politicians would not want to do that," Allyn said. "They would want to distance themselves in case it did not turn out good. But Keith laid it on the line."
Other observers note that, even with the staff he now has, Ellison's imprint on the office is becoming clearer more than halfway through his first term.
"People often talk about the AG's Office and some of the history of the AG's Office as being really the preeminent law firm in Minnesota," said Lola Velazquez-Aguilu, one of several pro-bono attorneys assisting with prosecuting the officers involved in Floyd's death. "With the work on this Chauvin prosecution, what you saw was really exceptional management of the legal team by Keith Ellison and also an expectation for the kinds of legal services and the quality of legal services that he believes the state of Minnesota is entitled to."
Ben Crump, an attorney for both Floyd and Daunte Wright's families, described the recent prosecution as the "best case I've ever seen of a police officer for killing a Black person unjustly in the United States of America."
"I hope that what Attorney General Ellison and the Minnesota Attorney General's Office accomplished will set a new precedent for Attorneys General Offices all over America," Crump said.
For at least two decades before Ellison took over, the Attorney General's Office was known more for cases on predatory lending, for-profit colleges and environmental matters such as the $850 million settlement with 3M over groundwater contamination.
Those areas remain priorities under Ellison, who also wants to beef up the office's wage theft enforcement capabilities. Ellison also is leading a new task force that plans to recommend policy changes to advance women's economic security.
But he wants to return the office's criminal division to the stature it held in the 1990s under Hubert Humphrey III when it had 12 full-time criminal attorneys. Just one remained when Ellison took office.
Mike Hatch, who served as attorney general from 1999 to 2007, said the attorney general's priorities adjust to the times. He launched a sweeping review of health care practices in the state in the early 2000s and his successor, Lori Swanson, entered office during the Great Recession.
"Sometimes you get to have some proactive activity, but it is a reactive office," Hatch said. "You have to take the cards that are dealt to you, and [Ellison] has done a very good job of handling Chauvin and he's certainly been passionate about the COVID business."
Ellison's budget request this year faces an uphill climb. The GOP-controlled Senate has vowed since last year to seek retribution for his enforcement of Walz's executive orders during the pandemic. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka's initial budget offer to House Democrats proposed to waive penalties for businesses that violated the orders.
Ellison also is facing a possible rematch of his contentious 2018 run with Republican Doug Wardlow.
Wardlow's early campaign has blamed Ellison for not adequately responding to violent crime spikes, something more commonly handled by county prosecutors. Wardlow also seized on Ellison's recent comments in favor of international watchdogs reviewing policing in America.
Those comments, Wardlow wrote in an editorial for the conservative Newsmax website, "seem calculated to sow division and advance the false narrative about systemic racism in our justice system."
His voice weary from a recent national media circuit after Chauvin's conviction, Ellison said the case showed "I tried to be of service to the community when needed, that we led with our values and ran the risk that things could go in an unpredictable direction."
"As I reflect on it," he added, "if we had not won what it would mean is that there is no accountability, that some people can treat anyone however they want. Even kill them, and the system doesn't really respond to do something about it."

Federal charges for 4 Floyd cops: Fired officers could face new trials for violating his civil rights; Chauvin is also charged in a 2017 case.

Full text: A federal grand jury has indicted four ex-Minneapolis police officers on charges of abusing their positions of authority to detain George Floyd, leading to his death last May.
The new charges, unsealed Friday morning, allege Derek Chauvin, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao used the "color of the law" to deprive Floyd of his constitutional rights to be "free from the use of unreasonable force" when Chauvin pinned Floyd down with a knee on his neck for more than nine minutes, and the other three did nothing to stop him. "This offense resulted in bodily injury to, and the death of George Floyd," the charges state.
Kueng, Lane and Thao appeared at a virtual hearing in U.S. District Court on Friday morning on the charges. They are not in custody.
Chauvin is being held in Oak Park Heights prison awaiting sentencing on the state's murder and manslaughter convictions related to the incident.
Chauvin also faces a separate two-count indictment alleging he willfully deprived a 14-year-old Minneapolis boy of his civil rights during a 2017 arrest. Chauvin pinned the teenager down and struck him on the head with his flashlight, then grabbed him by the throat and hit him again, according to court documents.
Prosecutors tried to introduce the incident in Chauvin's murder trial as evidence of his policing style; a judge deemed it inadmissible.
The Justice Department charges come 11 months after the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota announced it was opening a federal investigation, and just weeks after a Hennepin County jury found Chauvin guilty in a livestreamed trial viewed worldwide.
The other three former officers are scheduled for trial in August in state court for aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
The federal charges come in addition to the state's cases, meaning all four former officers could face new trials in federal court.
The Justice Department investigation has run parallel to the state's cases. Leading up to Chauvin's murder trial, federal prosecutors believed they had enough evidence to charge him with civil rights violations, but they feared publicity around new indictments would disrupt the state's trial. If Chauvin were found not guilty on all counts or the case ended in a mistrial, the Justice Department planned to arrest him at the courthouse on the federal charges, according to sources who were not authorized to speak publicly. The plan would turn out not to be necessary when Chauvin was found guilty on all charges.
The new charges also run in addition to the Justice Department's civil investigation into whether Minneapolis police engage in a pattern and practice of unlawful behavior. Justice officials announced this investigation the day after Chauvin's guilty verdict.
Eric Nelson, Chauvin's attorney in state court, declined to comment. Messages seeking comment were left for the attorneys representing the other three former officers in state court.
"The federal government has a responsibility to protect the civil rights of every American and to pursue justice to the fullest extent of federal law," said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is serving as special prosecutor on the state's cases.
"Federal prosecution for the violation of George Floyd's civil rights is entirely appropriate, particularly now that Derek Chauvin has been convicted of murder under Minnesota law for the death of George Floyd. The State is planning to present our case against the other three defendants to another jury in Hennepin County later this summer," Ellison said.
The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which is providing legal representation for the four officers in their state cases, said it will be doing the same in federal court with the same attorneys. The association otherwise declined to comment on the indictments.
Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, whose legal team negotiated a $27 million legal settlement from the city of Minneapolis for Floyd's survivors, said in a statement, "Today's federal indictment for criminal civil rights violations associated with the murder of George Floyd reinforces the strength and wisdom of the United States Constitution. The Constitution claims to be committed to life, liberty, and justice, and we are seeing this realized in the justice George Floyd continues to receive. … We are encouraged by these charges and eager to see continued justice in this historic case that will impact Black citizens and all Americans for generations to come."
The Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime civil rights figure who eulogized Floyd at his funeral last year and has been a visible supporter of the family, said in a statement that the news "shows we have a Justice Department that deals with police criminality and does not excuse it nor allow police to act as though what they do is acceptable behavior in the line of duty."
Referencing earlier instances of Blacks around the country dying in recent years after encounters with police, Sharpton said, "What we couldn't get [federal authorities] to do in the case of Eric Garner, Michael Brown in Ferguson, and countless others, we are finally seeing them do today. … This is a significant development for those of us who have been engaged in the struggle and police reform movement."
Derrick Johnson, national president of the NAACP, called the indictments a "step in the right direction" but said the case highlights the need for police reforms, including implementing a national registry of police misconduct data.
"While Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd over 9 minutes and 29 seconds, no other police officer on the scene acted to save his life," Johnson said. "The horrifying actions and inactions of all four police officers resulted in the preventable death of a loving father, son and brother. No police officer is above the law, nor should they ever be shielded from accountability. We need urgent reforms now."
Over the past decade, federal prosecutors have brought civil rights charges against officers in the U.S. 41 times per year on average, according to a report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
The most recent federal civil rights trial against a Minnesota officer took place in 2019, for St. Paul officer Brett Palkowitsch. Palkowitsch kicked an unarmed 52-year-old Black man who was handcuffed and being attacked by a police K-9, leaving him with seven broken ribs and two collapsed lungs. The jury found the officer guilty, by a standard of using "more force than a reasonable officer would use under the circumstances."
The stand-alone indictment of Chauvin relates to a violent arrest captured on body-camera footage, which prosecutors for the state's case described in court documents, citing it as evidence of Chauvin's brand of violent policing when dealing with suspects who refuse to bend to his will.
On Sept. 4, 2017, Chauvin and another officer responded to a domestic assault, in which a mother said her juvenile son and daughter assaulted her. The officers arrived to find the 14-year-old son lying on the floor in the back of the house, on his phone, and ordered him to get up because he was under arrest. When the boy refused to comply, Chauvin grabbed him and wordlessly struck the teen in the head with his flashlight multiple times.
The video shows Chauvin using a neck restraint, choking the boy unconscious, then placing him in a prone position with a knee in his back for about 17 minutes until paramedics arrived, according to court documents.
In a scene reminiscent of the Floyd arrest, Chauvin held the position even after the child told him that he was in pain and couldn't breathe, and after the mother tried to intervene, prosecutors said. At one point, the boy started bleeding from his ear -- from getting hit with the flashlight, he later told paramedics -- and he asked to be flipped on his back. He then began crying and again asked to be flipped over, prompting Chauvin to ask if the boy would be "flopping around at all."
"No," the boy responded.
"Better not," Chauvin said.
He kept his knee on the child's back. According to prosecutors, Chauvin's report from the incident suggested that the boy "then displayed active resistance to efforts to take him into custody" by "flailing his arms around." He went on to write that the boy, whom he described as "approximately 6'2" and at least 240 pounds," would "escalate his efforts to not be arrested," and because of the boy's large size, Chauvin "deliver[ed] a few strikes to [the juvenile male] to impact his shoulders and hopefully allow control to be obtained."
Chauvin's sentencing is scheduled for June 25. The state's trial for the other three officers is set to begin Aug. 23.

Full text: Nonprofits that have long led race and equity programs in the community are now pivoting to look inward, boosting diversity efforts amid the global racial reckoning after George Floyd's murder.
At Greater Twin Cities United Way, one of the state's largest social services nonprofits, leaders are adding training on diversity, equity and inclusion for employees and opening jobs to applicants without a college degree.
In June, board members and staffers will begin a nine-month "equity journey" focused on "racial reconciliation." The new measures follow a significant turnover of employees of color, who constituted 43% of the employees leaving the nonprofit in the past two years, according to the organization.
The Twin Cities United Way is "actively, continuously and humbly building our capacity to create equity, justice, inclusion and ableism inside and outside of our organization," CEO John Wilgers and board chairwoman Dorothy Bridges said in a statement.
Across Minnesota, many nonprofits and foundations are boosting the number of people of color on staff, in leadership roles, on boards and in volunteer ranks. As in government and business, however, these initiatives are often met with challenging realities.
Some current and former employees at United Way describe a workplace that made them uncomfortable.
Lynette Commodore, who is Black, left United Way in 2019 after two years, frustrated by white colleagues who she said repeatedly touched her hair. She felt she had to constantly educate white peers on Black culture.
"It was a racially hostile environment," she said. "My hair was a major source of curiosity for my white colleagues. ... I've never had people touch my hair so much in an office."
Commodore said she shared concerns with supervisors and an employee group, but nothing changed.
"It never seemed to be intentionally malicious, it was just ignorance," said Commodore, who left to start a business. "There are a lot of things that were so subtle ... but it made work an uncomfortable environment."
'Transformational journey'
United Way isn't the only Twin Cities nonprofit to boost its internal diversity efforts.
Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis is looking to hire a full-time director to oversee its racial equity and social justice work. Of more than 500 employees, 52% are people of color even though 70% of clients are nonwhite.
When Derek Chauvin was being tried in the death of George Floyd, managers started meeting twice a week to talk about how they could better support staffers -- especially employees of color -- during the often traumatic court proceedings.
"Our organization is all about social justice. ... It requires some additional intentionality and investment," said CEO Michael Goar, who made history this year as the first person of color in Catholic Charities' top job in its 150 years. "This is sort of a transformational journey and you're not going to change it overnight."
Last summer, board members at the Douglas Dayton YMCA in Minneapolis urged the parent YMCA of the North to address systemic racism. Since then, the Y has held listening sessions, started an advisory team with employees of color and hired a "people and culture" executive.
In St. Paul, Wilderness Inquiry has long worked on building equity in the outdoors. But after Floyd's death, the all-white staff launched an internal justice, equity, diversity and inclusion initiative, recruited more board members of color and analyzed pay inequities.
"We have a long way to go, as does everyone else," said Kim Keprios, the executive director. "It's important ... to walk the talk."
Employees at Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative in St. Paul are seeking to form a union in part to stem high turnover of people of color.
"Some amazing things are going on at Beacon, but we recognize that we can't fix the systems that exist in the wider world if we haven't fixed the systems that exist within Beacon as well," said Craig Freeman, who's leading the effort.
The Twin Cities United Way -- one of the largest of about 1,800 United Ways nationwide -- gives millions of dollars a year. It recently led a culturally specific food drive, and after Floyd's death it joined the Minneapolis Foundation and St. Paul & Minnesota Foundation to help businesses damaged in the unrest and to reform the criminal justice system.
Retention a challenge
But 11 current and former United Way employees who spoke to the Star Tribune, six of whom are people of color, expressed concern about turnover of people of color and the lack of diversity in leadership. Eight declined to be named for fear of losing their job or facing backlash in the sector.
United Way leaders declined to comment on former employees but said 32% of board members and 30% of employees are people of color. In the past five years, the state Department of Human Rights has had one closed case involving United Way but didn't find probable cause of racial discrimination.
Jerrald Spencer Jr. left United Way in March after 13 months. Spencer, who is Black, said he was offered severance, which he felt was retaliation for questioning leaders about race-related decisions. He resigned instead and has filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
Last year, United Way leaders rephrased a statement after Floyd's death, saying he was "murdered" by police rather than "killed" after Spencer and others requested the change.
When Spencer asked for Juneteenth as a paid holiday, United Way initiated flex holidays employees can take when they want, he said. Spencer said he confronted Wilgers when he called him by the wrong name, for which Wilgers apologized.
"I've done nothing wrong here," Spencer said. "I've only brought up things that have either hurt me, hurt other people or things that could have been approached differently or made us look more intentional when we're trying to change as an organization."
Drew Coursin quit in October after three years at United Way. Coursin, who is white, said the nonprofit paid "lip service to equity" because it had mostly white leaders.
"We hold out nonprofits, specifically United Way, as defenders of equity, as champions for underrepresented populations … and yet they can't retain persons of color," he said.
Employees are often wary of speaking up for fear of hurting a nonprofit's mission, said Lisa Bowman, a former executive at United Way Worldwide in Atlanta who filed an EEOC complaint over retaliation she said she faced for reporting sexual misconduct there. But she said donors and board members need to know.
"If you think about what's happening in our country, we're having a breakdown to some extent of all the trusted institutions," she said. "And sort of the last frontier of that is the nonprofit sector. Those are the people that we all trust to do good and do the right thing."

Juror defends presence at rally: Online commentators note potential for this to be part of Chauvin appeal.

Full text: A juror in the Derek Chauvin murder trial attended the March on Washington anniversary last summer, which is drawing online speculation about his motives for serving on the trial and could become grounds for an appeal.
In recent days, a photo of Brandon Mitchell that was originally posted on social media around the Aug. 28 event commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech began circulating online and on multiple news sites. Many commentators online questioned his motive and its potential to fuel an appeal in Chauvin's case.
Mitchell, who is Black, was one of 12 jurors who convicted Chauvin two weeks ago on all counts against him -- second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter -- in the May 25 killing of George Floyd, who is also Black. Mitchell was the first juror to go public about his role, and spoke to several media outlets last week.
"I'd never been to [Washington] D.C.," Mitchell said Monday of his reasons for attending the event. "The opportunity to go to D.C., the opportunity to be around thousands and thousands of Black people; I just thought it was a good opportunity to be a part of something."
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, did not return a message seeking comment. Mitchell's appearance at the rally was first reported by the International Business Times, an online publication.
The matter is likely to be cited by Nelson as one of many bases for an appeal, said a law professor and defense attorney.
"If [Mitchell] specifically was asked, 'Have you ever participated in a Black Lives Matter demonstration,' and he answered, 'No,' to that, I think that would be an important appealable issue," said Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.
The picture shows Mitchell, 31, standing next to two cousins in Washington, D.C. He is wearing a Black T-shirt with a picture of King surrounded by the words, "GET YOUR KNEE OFF OUR NECKS" and "BLM" (Black Lives Matter). Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds.
Mitchell said the social media post was made by his uncle, who is the father of one of the cousins pictured. However, he said, he has no recollection of wearing or owning the shirt.
Mitchell said the event was commemorating the 57th anniversary of King's famous speech, which advocated for civil and economic rights for Blacks, and is credited with helping to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The event was "100 percent not" a march for Floyd, Mitchell said, adding, "It was directly related to MLK's March on Washington from the '60s … The date of the March on Washington is the date."
The event included advocating for racial justice, increasing voter registration, pushing for a new version of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and urging participation in the 2020 census.
It also focused on police use of force. Floyd's brother and sister, Philonise and Bridgett Floyd, and family members of others who have been shot by police addressed the crowd. It served as a rallying point for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a federal police reform bill.
Mitchell said he answered "no" to two questions in the juror questionnaire sent out before jury selection that asked about participation in demonstrations.
The first question asked, "Did you, or someone close to you, participate in any of the demonstrations or marches against police brutality that took place in Minneapolis after George Floyd's death?"
The second asked, "Other than what you have already described above, have you, or anyone close to you, participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality?"
Mitchell said he was not concerned about backlash for his participation in the march, noting its historic significance beyond the Chauvin case.
"This was a big deal," he said of the event. "It's a national thing."
Mitchell took issue with at least one news account of the picture that said he told the court during jury selection that he had no knowledge of Chauvin's case.
"I think I was being extremely honest, for sure," he said of the jury selection process. "I gave my views on everything -- on the case, on Black Lives Matter."
Nelson asked Mitchell several questions during jury selection, and Mitchell told him: He had watched clips of bystander video of the incident; he had talked about the case with his family, friends and co-workers; he had wondered why three other officers at the scene didn't stop Chauvin; and he had a "very favorable" opinion of Black Lives Matter.
Mitchell also told Nelson he knew some police officers at his gym who were "great guys," and that he felt neutral about Blue Lives Matter, a pro-police group. He said he could be neutral at trial.
Defense attorney Mike Padden, who is not involved in the case, said Mitchell should have divulged his participation and let attorneys and the judge decide whether it would unfairly influence him at trial.
"It's disconcerting," Padden said. "Maybe with that disclosure, Mr. Nelson keeps him on the jury, but I don't think so."
Padden said had he been in Nelson's shoes and known about the march in conjunction with Mitchell's answer about BLM, he would have asked the court to dismiss him from the jury pool, and were that denied by the judge, he would have used a peremptory strike to dismiss him.
It's the attorneys' jobs to home in on issues and ferret out more detailed answers, said Daly, who praised Nelson's trial performance.
"You don't have to, as a potential juror, go to confession," Daly said. "It's not like you're opening up your entire life and everything you've ever done that may or may not relate to this case. It's the job of the lawyers to look for and find unbiased jurors."
The issue's strength on appeal, Daly said, rests on whether the court believes Mitchell lied in his questionnaire or during jury selection, which is a crime.

Clock ticking on police reform: George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passes House but faces narrow path in Senate.

Author: Woodall, Hunter

Full text: President Joe Biden's call for Congress to pass police reform legislation by the anniversary of George Floyd's killing adds urgency to the task of federal lawmakers and the Minnesota delegation to find an agreement.
Biden urged lawmakers to "find a consensus" by May 25. The bill passed by the House, dubbed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, would limit the qualified immunity that can protect officers from legal liability in civil court, ban chokeholds for federal law enforcement and make criminally prosecuting officers easier.
The proposal is dividing Congress and Minnesota's delegation, reflecting a deeper national debate about policing. Minnesota has been at the forefront of this debate since Floyd's death nearly a year ago, but there are fresh signs of movement since the conviction two weeks ago of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of Floyd.
With the narrowest of Democratic majorities in the Senate, support from several Republicans will more than likely be necessary to pass a bill out of the chamber. But that could also mean giving up changes prized by progressives.
"It's fine to me to make some concessions, but to make concessions to sort of eliminate the possibility of the legislation having any meaningful impact is dangerous to me," Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Democrat who represents the district where Floyd was killed, said in an interview. "Because I don't want us to want to pass a piece of legislation that will ultimately do nothing just so that we can say we passed something."
What exactly a congressional compromise could look like is unclear. But the day after Biden's speech, new signs of momentum emerged. Rep. Pete Stauber, a Republican and former Duluth police officer, participated virtually in a closed-door bipartisan discussion on police reform Thursday, according to his spokesperson.
"We will take as long as necessary to get this legislation right," Stauber said in a statement.
Stauber and other House Republicans voted against the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act when it passed the House in early March. Stauber sponsored a police reform bill in the House, called the JUSTICE Act, which is less sweeping than the Democrats' bill.
Stauber and an influential group of Republican legislators remain dead set against a proposal to remove what is called qualified immunity, a law that shields state and local government workers, including police officers, from personal liability while performing official duties unless they clearly violate the Constitution.
Removing the provision could open new avenues for victims of police brutality or misconduct, or their families, to sue officers and police departments. Critics say removing the provision could unleash a wave of unnecessary lawsuits and have a chilling effect on recruiting new officers.
"Any package moving forward cannot abolish qualified immunity," Stauber said. "Removing it is a red line for me and my Republican colleagues."
And in the Senate, the 60-vote threshold for most legislation makes any sweeping changes a tough sell, especially by Biden's deadline.
"It's a bold goal, but this is a time for bold action," Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a Democrat, said in his own statement: "While speed is of the essence, sound policy is more important than an artificial timeline."
Omar, meanwhile, is renewing her push for additional federal action that includes the National Police Misuse of Force Investigation Board Act. The bill outlines a new federal agency that would investigate officer-involved shootings, instances where the use of force caused "severe bodily injury in police custody" and deaths that happened while in the custody of police.
"I think that there is a real understanding that the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, although it is bold and transformative, it's not comprehensive," Omar said.
Getting Omar on the same page with Republicans like Stauber and Rep. Tom Emmer will be tough. After Floyd's death, Omar called for dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department. When former President Barack Obama and other influential Democrats said the "defund police" slogan threatened to alienate scores of people who might agree to some reforms, Omar responded in a tweet, "We lose people in the hands of police. It's not a slogan but a policy demand."
"Efforts to reform policing should not be rushed and should include the very people keeping our communities safe; law enforcement," Emmer said in a statement.
The day after Biden's speech, George Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, was among the family members of Black men killed by law enforcement who visited with several lawmakers in Washington, and later met with White House officials.
"It means more to these families than anybody else because that legislation will literally have the bloodstain of their loved ones," Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters after a meeting that included Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate.
As the leading GOP voice in Congress' policing debate, Scott is likely key to getting a bipartisan bill through the Senate. The South Carolina Republican has been in talks with Democrats, but pointed out to reporters that he was not the one who set a May 25 deadline.
"I think the best thing we can do is keep in mind why we're doing what we're doing," Scott said.
But for Minnesota's senior senator, the president's timeline was welcomed.
"I agree with President Biden, we must take immediate action to pass policing reform," Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a statement.

SUMMER ARTS PREVIEW: JUST LIKE STARTING OVER ; WITH A NEWFOUND RESOLVE, MINNESOTA ARTISTS PREPARE TO MAKE THEIR PANDEMIC COMEBACKS.

Full text: Annie Mack adjusted the microphone Sunday at the Parkway Theater in Minneapolis, her hands shaking. It had been a year since her last sound check, her last show.
A loud pop burst through the speakers.
"Well, it is my first time," Mack said, smiling at the sound engineer. "It really is."
After a year of lost gigs and living-room livestreams, performers are preparing for a cautious return to stages with rehearsal bubbles and backstage masks and distanced seating.
Most major plays and mega concerts are months off, still. The Guthrie Theater isn't planning a big in-person show until "A Christmas Carol" in November. But other stages are being set: The Minnesota Orchestra will welcome limited audiences in June. Chanhassen Dinner Theatres will pick up where it left off with "The Music Man" in July. First Avenue will resume indoor shows at its venues in September.
A year into a pandemic that's battered the arts scene and many artists' livelihoods, performers are beginning to book gigs and banter with audiences again.
Returning to live music feels like reuniting with an old lover who got away, Mack said, making the same sorts of fervent promises. She hopes that venues will value anew the energy performers bring. That audiences will respect the sacredness of what's being offered. And that musicians will show up on time for sound check.
"Oh, my goodness, I will cherish you," she said, chuckling. "I will not take you for granted."
But Mack, like other performers, will show up differently this time. After a powerful set during Billy McLaughlin's weekly "The Church of the Lost Souls," she told the socially distanced crowd how this year apart has shaped which gigs she plays.
"My hustle has changed," Mack said. "I move with more intention."
Many actors and artists, musicians and fans have used this pause to rethink their industries and their art forms, from how people are paid to how big institutions wield their power.
They don't just want to return to stages. They're demanding that those stages better reflect their communities.
"My great hope is that the theater industry, when it comes back, looks very different from when we left it," said AnaSof-a Villanueva, a theater producer, director, writer and activist.
Since George Floyd's murder last May spurred a broader cultural shift, she's seen theaters across the country tweak their programming, "which is important," she said. "Representation does matter."
But Villanueva fears large theaters will "continue to hide behind a facade of displayed diversity onstage," as she put it in an essay last year, rather than doing the deep, foundational work that's needed.
A life-altering hiatus
The arts and culture industries have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, leaving many artists -- especially performing artists -- suddenly unemployed.
During the quarter that ended in September, the national unemployment rate averaged 8.5%, but 55% of dancers, 52% of actors and 27% of musicians were out of work, according to the National Endowment for the Arts. Those figures improved during the past quarter, said Sunil Iyengar, the NEA's research director. "We're hopeful that's a trend," he said.
Artists and arts groups have been scrambling and hustling, he said, shifting to virtual performances -- something they say they plan to continue after in-person events begin again. (Streaming can be costly for a nonprofit, Iyengar noted, with less obvious income streams.)
A recent NEA webinar on reopening started with remarks from Dr. Anthony Fauci, who pegged a return to movie and Broadway theaters "sometime in the fall," adding "this is no guarantee."
"Even when things open up again ... you're still going to be dealing with limited seating capacity," Iyengar said. He's hopeful that federal funding for the arts, including the $16 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program co-authored by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., will help fill the gap.
Chanhassen was nine shows into "The Music Man" when concerns about COVID-19 forced venues to close. A three-week pause became three months, then became a year.
"I don't think any of us realized how life-altering this would be," said Michael Gruber, a theater veteran who earned raves for his role as Prof. Harold Hill. Each week since, the cast has held a Zoom happy hour. On the one-year anniversary, they gathered in the theater's parking lot.
Gruber, 56, has used the time to deconstruct and rebuild his singing voice, an exercise he couldn't have fit between eight shows a week. He's given vocal lessons via Zoom. He's performed in senior-center parking lots.
"Music Man" is set to reopen in July. Rules worked out with Actors' Equity union include a requirement that each person backstage be vaccinated, said spokeswoman Kris Howland. There will be face masks and air purifiers. The theater is upgrading its air filters.
Most of the close-knit cast is returning. One actor, though, has switched careers. One youth has left for college. But Gruber's options are limited, he joked: "What else could I do? Nobody wants a 56-year-old who sings and dances."
"Luckily the theater I'm working at is in a financial situation that there is a job to go back to when we're ready to go back," he said. "Many people don't have jobs to go back to. Even Broadway shows have closed.
"I'm really going to savor it."
Some arts groups are moving outdoors. After a year of digital shows, the Schubert Club will hold five concerts at the State Fairgrounds in early June starring cellist David Finckel and pianist Wu Han.
The State Fair itself is hoping to return in August, but several big outdoor events have been nixed, including Rock the Garden. Northern Spark, the dusk-till-dawn art festival, hasn't ruled out in-person programming but so far has announced only June events online and by mail. Amid a speedy vaccine rollout, fans might expect an in-person extravaganza, said executive director Sarah Peters. But planning started last year, when the public-health picture was hazier.
Funding, too, has been in flux. The Minnesota State Arts Board has canceled project grants in favor of smaller, more flexible grants, and corporations have pulled money from the arts to other aims.
"Just because the vaccine is here, and it might be safe to gather again, doesn't mean we can," said Peters. "We've all gone through hell in our budgets."
Showing up 'in full'
In March of last year, "everything just stopped," Mack said.
Small gigs and big moneymakers disappeared from her calendar. She sat and ate and grieved. Then George Floyd's murder prompted a new round of grief. Mack, who lives in Rochester, recorded an EP, "Testify," rooted in blues, gospel and Americana, as a "humble offering."
She baked and gardened and cared for her kids. She also studied to become a death doula: "I want to walk that journey with people." But because of COVID restrictions, for now she's volunteering in the kitchen of a hospice center, making meals.
"I put whipped cream and chocolate sauce on everything," said Mack, who is fully vaccinated.
Music, though, keeps calling. And the pandemic has taught her new ways to respond. She won't do stuff "that doesn't serve my spirit and my community." Many of her performances are educational, connecting with young women of color.
She shows up now, she said, "not in fragments, but as a full Black woman who has found a medium, a tool."
On a gray, drizzly Sunday, after weeks of livestreamed shows, she took the stage before about 50 people spread out among the Parkway's 365 seats. She was a guest in a series, also streamed online, led by McLaughlin and his group SimpleGifts.
As Mack sang, her voice rich and low, about being "no longer afraid to take up space," women in the crowd nodded along.

Full text: Nekima Levy Armstrong is a Minneapolis civil rights attorney and activist who has led several groups promoting racial equality, including as president of the local NAACP chapter and an adviser to Black Lives Matter.
Now her work has been recognized by Oprah Winfrey, who interviewed Levy Armstrong just hours after the jury returned its guilty verdict in Derek Chauvin's murder trial.
Winfrey credited Levy Armstrong as being among the voices responsible for turning George Floyd's death into a global conversation. She asked Levy Armstrong to recount how an ordinary Memorial Day turned extraordinary
when she learned a man had been killed during an arrest by Minneapolis police.
Levy Armstrong told Winfrey she called Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo to let him know that community members' version of events differed greatly from his officers' and that video of the incident was circulating on social media.
She called the guilty verdict as more accountability than justice. "Justice would have been stopping Derek Chauvin in his tracks before he ever even laid eyes on George Floyd," she said in the interview.
Late last week, Levy Armstrong received an enormous bouquet of flowers from Winfrey along with an affirming message to thank her for her work on behalf of the community.
"I know the demand for justice continues," Winfrey wrote. "But just for today … relish the victory!"
Posting an image of the bouquet and note on social media, Levy Armstrong thanked all those participating in the fight for justice.
"And thank you especially to the Black women who are always holding it down, when it is popular and when it is not, for the sake of our community," she wrote.
Levy Armstrong said she was honored to lift up the work of those who applied pressure, demonstrated, organized and put their bodies on the line to demand justice and accountability in the wake of Floyd's brutal murder.
"It was refreshing and affirming to see Oprah take such a strong interest in the organizing and activism work of those of us on the front lines for racial justice in the state of Minnesota," she said.
