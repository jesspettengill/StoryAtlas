Full text: At 22, Raie Gessesse isn't waiting to inspire change. Appointed by former Gov. Mark Dayton, she served as a member of the first-ever Young Women's Cabinet, working to elevate the voices of future female leaders, and received a $2,500 microgrant to invest in her vision as a Women's Foundation of Minnesota Innovator. She currently trains young women to run for office as Midwest Program Manager for IGNITE National, and aspires to run for office herself someday. She graduated in May from Hamline University with a double major in public health and political science, and hopes to begin law and public policy school this fall. Gessesse is Minnesota-born, but her story begins in a different place.
Q: Let's start at the beginning. How would you describe your childhood?
A: I was born in Minnesota, but I like to start with my parents' story. My parents were born and raised in Ethiopia. When my mother was pregnant with me, they received notice that they had won a diversity visa; this is a lottery program that allows people to gain permanent residency in the United States. They first came to Boston in 1998 but heard Minnesota was the place to be to start a job. They arrived here with nothing but a vision and a dream and a baby.
Q: Your lovely name certainly attests to that dream.
A: Raie (pronounced Rah-EE) means "God's vision."
Q: I'm guessing that in 1998, your parents faced challenges as emigrants. What have they told you?
A: We have a thriving community now but when my parents came, they were among few Ethiopians. For seven years, they lived in St. Paul in the heart of the Ethiopian community. Growing up, I felt surrounded by my extended family. Then we moved to Cottage Grove, where we've been ever since.
Q: Is this when you got an inkling that you were different from your classmates?
A: I grew up believing that this is the land of opportunity. Moving to the suburbs, I still didn't know I was different until I was made to feel that way because of my braids, complexion, traditional foods. In elementary school, I got pulled out for English Language Learners (ELL). But I spoke fluent English, along with Amharic. My parents had to fight to get me out of ELL. As the only Black girl, I started to feel lonely, isolated, awkward. My household was my safe harbor. I was a smart kid but it was always, "How did you get to be so smart?" Up to college, there was always skepticism about what I could accomplish, always the question, "Are you sure?"
Q: How did your parents comfort you, mitigate that?
A: I remember one conversation with my mom. I was telling her how lonely and isolated I was. She said, "Your identity is your gift." That was a shattering moment for me. Why am I sacrificing my story and experiences for folks who don't matter? The story of my life is the product of my parents' dreams. For four years, I had been straightening my hair every single day. In 10th grade, I let my hair be natural for the first time. I said, no more! I need to re-center myself to when I was 4 or 6, feeling like I could be anyone I wanted.
Q: And?
A: I signed up for a talent show doing traditional dance. I joined the step team. And I founded my high school's first Students for Justice club, becoming its inaugural president. Shortly after graduating, I was appointed to the first Young Women's Cabinet.
Q: Tell us about a Cabinet project you spearheaded.
A: In 2019, we championed the Women of Color Opportunity Act at the state Legislature. I wrote and introduced an amendment for paid job internship opportunities; so many internships are offered but I, and many others like me, can't afford to take on an unpaid position. These are pipelines to future jobs. The act didn't pass but we're advocating again this year. No more unpaid internships!
Q: Where were you when you heard that George Floyd had been killed?
A: A friend texted me and I was so overwhelmed. This is in a part of Minneapolis that a lot of us are very familiar with. I was feeling grief, but also was very angry. The Minneapolis Police Department has a history of misconduct. I just couldn't believe it had to get to this point. For the next few days, I posted to social media e-mails and phone numbers for senators, City Council members, the mayors, attorney general, governor. I saw my role as sharing resources to make sure that everyone knows this is not OK.
Q: Why do you think race is such a fraught topic? Do tragedies such as the death of George Floyd make it easier or more difficult to begin conversations?
A: Those who are not racially oppressed say, "Since I haven't experienced it, I don't know what to do with this information." Yes, this is a land of opportunity and a place of refuge for my family, but it has also not acknowledged an ugly past. That's hard for a white person -- to be part of centuries-long oppression. On the other hand, when we finally get to a place where we can acknowledge the truth, we can move forward. My mom always said, the truth shall set you free. That speaks so profoundly to the moment we're in right now.
Q: How might you help us engage in this essential conversation in a productive way?
A: Learning is so important. Make sure you're reading books by authors of color. I'd recommend "How To Be An Antiracist," by Ibram X. Kendi, and "Hood Feminism: Notes From the Women That a Movement Forgot," by Mikki Kendall. In your organizations, be conscious about how many people of color are present. Where are they in the leadership line? In meetings, are they participating or hesitant? If it's the latter, that might mean that it's not a safe space for them to talk. Create change where you're at.
Q: Would you share your story about your pre-COVID encounter on a plane? It's a good lesson.
A: I was on a plane from Chicago to Minneapolis, chatting with a woman. She asked me what my name was. I told her "Raie," and she said, "That's more American than I thought." Like, boom! She couldn't even see me as a person born and raised in America. I took this as an educational opportunity. I told her all about my childhood.
Q: Did she catch on?
A: She was mortified. She later apologized and realized how her comments were misguided and harmful. As a movement-builder, we need as many allies as we can get. If someone makes a mistake, I can respond in a graceful way that brings her into the conversation. We ended up having this great conversation.

Star Tribune's Floyd coverage garners honor: Prestigious George Polk Award was given for the newspaper's work in the local reporting category.

Full text: The Star Tribune has been honored with a prestigious George Polk Award for its coverage of the death of George Floyd and its aftermath.
The George Polk Awards, established in 1949 by Long Island University, are a major American journalism prize that honors the work of reporters who "uncover matters of critical importance to an informed public and the very foundation of democratic society." The awards are in honor of George Polk, a CBS correspondent who was murdered in 1948 while covering the civil war in Greece.
According to the announcement Wednesday, the Star Tribune staff was honored with the Local Reporting award for work that spanned seven months beginning when George Floyd died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day.
"Our staff poured its heart and soul into covering this tragic story," said Rene Sanchez, Star Tribune editor. "We all wanted to do our best work for the community at such a painful time."
Star Tribune police reporter Libor Jany had finished working a holiday shift when he got word about a news conference regarding an in-custody police death. He soon learned there was more to the story than what police were reporting and doggedly pursued the details through the night.
A Facebook video posted by a 17-year-old bystander showed a police officer kneeling on the neck of a Black man for nearly nine minutes as the man pleaded for his life. The story unfolded from there as Jany learned that Floyd was the man who died and Derek Chauvin was the officer who held him to the ground while three other officers were nearby.
Within hours, the full force of the newsroom pivoted to cover the emerging story that helped ignite a racial reckoning. Aggressive work by Star Tribune reporters and photojournalists combined with digital and print designers, copy editors and digital teams to bring readers in-depth coverage.
"I'm immensely proud of the work that we did as a newsroom in not only covering the breaking news side of this story but also producing enterprise pieces … that provided further context for our readers," Jany said.
The George Polk Awards jury commended the Star Tribune for Jany's "spot-on deadline work" and the newspaper's coverage that delved into the backgrounds of Floyd and the officers indicted in the case. The coverage, the jury noted, included articles that explored the "unsavory history of a precinct, destroyed by protesters, that was considered a breeding ground for renegade cops."
"The articles portrayed an ineffective police disciplinary process and reported on attempts to rethink the role of police and pick up the pieces in neighborhoods ravaged in the protests."
Earlier this year, the Star Tribune won an Online Journalism Award for breaking news stemming from its round-the-clock reporting of Floyd's death and the aftermath.

As trial looms, Mpls. faces balancing act with police

Full text: Minneapolis residents and business owners say anxiety is building as the first of the former police officers charged in the death of George Floyd heads to trial.
As city and state leaders plan to bring thousands of soldiers, sheriffs' deputies and police into the metro area, they face a delicate balancing act: providing a sense of security to residents who want a large law enforcement presence while trying to avoid retraumatizing those who have endured brutal encounters with police.
They expect tensions will escalate as the trial of former officer Derek Chauvin nears a close and people wait to see whether the jury acquits him, a decision that would cement activists' fears.
"The permission that we give the police and how they treat people -- and especially people of color in this community -- the message it would send, it is literally unfathomable," said Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality. "I don't want to see what would happen in this community if they let these people walk."
Minneapolis officials plan to contract with local groups to do de-escalation work.
Neighborhood groups are pressing city leaders for information about planning. Businesses are debating whether to board up windows. And local activist groups are organizing events and discussing the creation of a TV program to explain legal issues related to police use of force.
Jury selection in Chauvin's trial begins March 8, and state and city leaders have outlined an expansive security plan in hopes of preventing a repeat of last summer's riots.
Hannah Lieder, who lives in the East Phillips neighborhood, wants them to "do whatever we need to do" to protect families and businesses if riots break out. She and her 6-year-old son, Louis Thompson, went to a protest at the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct last spring expecting it to be peaceful. Instead, her son saw a man who had been stabbed in the chest and had to run as police used tear gas on the crowd.
"It just scared me," said Louis, whose bicycle smelled of the gas for months.
Unlike last spring when the unrest broke out in Minneapolis, this year officials have time to plan, said Rep. Carlos Mariani, DFL-St. Paul. But he asks: "Who is all at that table planning? In my mind it would be just a huge mistake if some elements of community perspectives are not at that table."
Police need to be connected with the people who are protesting and marching through the streets, he said.
"Those are the very people that point law enforcement in the direction of someone who is looking to take advantage of a situation and cause harm," Mariani said.
When Freddie Gray died in police custody in 2015, Baltimore, like Minneapolis, saw hundreds of businesses damaged and fires around the city. But after Floyd's death, Baltimore became a place where demonstrations played out relatively peacefully. Activist Kwame Rose, who was arrested as he participated in the protests in 2015, has been frequently cited as someone who helped ensure safety last year in Baltimore.
Rose said it was critical to have grassroots Black leadership at the forefront of the protests, and said in Baltimore they kept an eye on white people who they saw passing out weapons to people in the protest crowd. At one point a man smashed a window with a meat cleaver, Rose said, and protesters told him, "That ain't what we're doing. Time to leave, buddy." When police told protesters to disperse at night, Rose also urged the crowd to go home.
Before the protests started, Rose said he asked police to be peaceful and said it was helpful when police did not wear riot gear and sent home officers who had a Blue Lives Matter flag. Rose said while he does not coordinate with police, he had the ear of the mayor and warned him about officer behavior that would set off people's pain or rage.
"You're smirking while we're out here literally crying. That sets people off, those smirks. Or just standing in military formation as opposed to, let's just have a conversation," Rose said.
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and state Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington have both been reaching out to different community groups ahead of the trial, including business associations and faith leaders.
Meanwhile, Minneapolis Office of Violence Prevention Director Sasha Cotton is working on a tool kit that will advise residents to connect with their neighbors, tell them how to barricade their street if they feel compelled to do so and list a city hotline to call with information that might not merit a 911 response. She said they will distribute flashlights and reflective vests. Minneapolis is also connecting with community leaders and traditional and alternative media to help distribute information to diverse communities, she said.
Cotton anticipates the City Council will consider a plan this week to contract with trusted community groups and nonprofits across the city that have de-escalation training and could help diffuse tension. She said they are also looking at adding community events and "therapeutic spaces" where people can process what is happening.
The city has not yet communicated its plans to neighborhood groups, said Melanie Majors, executive director of the Longfellow Community Council. She said in addition to the new safety measures Cotton's office is trying, "One would hope you have true and tested measures that would provide for public safety." She believes a curfew -- one that is communicated far in advance -- worked last spring.
Majors said she has been hearing from a lot of business owners who are weighing whether to board up windows. People don't want to build "fortresses," she said; they want to have faith that they will be protected.
But she said that trust has been shaken. "Everybody wants to avoid what happened last time, but then there's -- 'But what if?' " Majors said. "A lot of it is still waiting to get guidance from the city."
Sara Wordofa owns Katar River Ethiopian Restaurant and Bakery on Minnehaha Avenue, just across from the Cub and Target that burned last spring.
"We are not feeling good," Wordofa said Friday. But more than her business, she worries about the state of the country. When she saw how police treated protesters last year, she invited them inside for shelter and water to drink and to wash their faces.
"I didn't see justice for George Floyd," she said. "The police have to treat everybody the same, Black and white."

A GUILTY PLEA, A LIFE UPENDED: BRYCE WILLIAMS FOUND PURPOSE IN FLOYD PROTESTS; NOW HE'S PAYING A PRICE FOR POLICE STATION FIRE.

Author: REID FORGRAVE

Full text: It had been several weeks since he had seen his daughter. So Bryce Williams, a 26-year-old former basketball star at a small Minnesota college, picked up 2-year-old Kinley and took her to a playground.
Williams had just returned from a two-week road trip in the days after George Floyd's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, joining a documentary film crew that started in Los Angeles and toured protests nationwide. The trip was invigorating. As a biracial man growing up in Minnesota, Williams had always struggled with identity. The protests gave him purpose. It was as if a lifetime of struggles to reconcile his Blackness finally burst out as he spoke at racial justice protests at every stop.
At the playground, Williams pushed Kinley on the swings. She slid down the slide. The whole time, though, something felt off. Like people were watching.
As they walked home, a dozen or so police cars roared up. Officers jumped out with guns drawn. Kinley screamed. Her mother -- Williams' co-parent and ex-fiance, seven months pregnant with their second child and living in Staples -- sprinted to retrieve her. Williams had no idea what was going on until an officer told him: He was being arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to commit arson. Months later, he would plead guilty to a charge that will give him up to five years in federal prison.
Later, Williams would admit he was at the arson of Minneapolis' Third Precinct station but claim he wasn't a primary actor: "I never physically burned down anything. I never physically lit anything."
But according to law enforcement, Williams was not a passive observer. As Williams had traversed the country, investigators pieced together images from his TikTok account and media reports and matched them with surveillance images. They surmised Williams had been at the forefront -- that he had helped others light and throw a Molotov cocktail, and that he had thrown a box on the fire.
According to prosecutors, Williams shared in the blame for the most searing moment of May's unrest, which terrified residents and caused more than $500 million in damages, including to many businesses owned by immigrants. But the deeper symbolic effect of a police station on fire -- a fire that endangered police officers and would cost some $10 million to replace -- continues to linger, even into January's riot at the U.S. Capitol by extreme right-wing insurrectionists.
---
Each side of America's deepening political divide painted what happened after Floyd's killing in its own way: "The riots," one side called it. "The uprising," said the other side. The politicized terminology has one thing in common, implying deeper motives by the most violent actors of those days of anarchy.
Except Bryce Williams does not fit neatly into those extreme labels. He is no activist at all; in fact, he has never even voted. He laughs at labels put on him, that he must have been either a white supremacist or "antifa." He sees himself as more diplomat than fighter.
Williams has a much more mundane explanation: He is a regular guy who got caught up in a moment.
Here's who Bryce Williams says he really is: He's the second-oldest of four, whose white mother had him at 17, who doesn't know his Black biological dad but whose stepdad, who is also Black, has been in his life since he was a year old. The most trouble he got in as a kid was for throwing snowballs at cars. He came of age in Christian organizations like Awana and Athletes in Action, and he has a chest tattoo of a crucifix and Philippians 4:13: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
He loved basketball so much he would shovel snow at Fridley's Madsen Park so he could put up shots. He attended five colleges in five states, chasing basketball dreams and eventually getting a business management degree from University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.
"I didn't even graduate high school," his mother said. "He really broke family barriers."
He is careful with this wardrobe, from a sherpa jean jacket to pristine Jordan 6 Rings Nike sneakers. His prior criminal record had only speeding and parking tickets.
He's also soon to be a felon. In March, a judge will determine his fate.
---
A couple of weeks before Williams' arrest, as the Twin Cities convulsed with peaceful protests and violent rioting, a crowd of hundreds gathered outside the Minneapolis Police Department's Third Precinct building. "Burn it down!" the crowd chanted. Officers evacuated, and the building went up in flames.
Williams was there, broadcasting it all on social media. Later, he'd say he got caught up in the moment: The excitement of protests and riots, the notoriety of his TikTok account blowing up to some 150,000 followers. The next morning, as the sun rose on a smoldering Twin Cities, he boarded a flight to Los Angeles for a previously planned trip to help a relative retrieve a car. Instead, he connected with the filmmakers.
After his arrest, he sat in jail, isolated, worried he'd be scapegoated for all the violence. He vomited every morning. He assumed he would miss his son's birth in August.
But the portrait of him as some anarchic arsonist just isn't the case, Williams says. Yes, he was there, and yes, he would eventually become the first to plead guilty in the arson. (Three others have since pleaded guilty.)
Williams will not discuss the specifics of what he did or did not do that night. "Yes, I regret being there," he said. "It's not who I am, not how I want to be represented. As a person, would I take it back? Yeah. … I don't believe that building should have ever been burnt down. Ever."
Yes, things got out of hand those nights -- dangerously out of hand. In a bigger sense, though, perhaps being in the thick of weeks of protests was exactly where Williams needed to be.
"George Floyd helped me figure out who I am, 100%."
---
"He grew up Black in white spaces," said his mother, Angela Williams.
His childhood was typical of suburban Minnesota. Bryce was the leader of a group of boys in a townhouse complex in Shoreview, climbing trees, making forts and riding dirtbikes. Family members had cabins Up North, and Williams grew up fishing for walleye on Lake Mille Lacs. But race shadowed a childhood that was often a quest to fit in.
His mother tells of going to her stepgrandfather's house for Christmas when Williams was a year old. All the kids got gifts except Bryce. His mother's white stepgrandfather made a racist joke: "I don't hate Black people. I think everyone should own one." His mother never returned.
In elementary school in Mounds View Public Schools, Williams says he was "the poor Black kid." He built friendships through sports. He was so dedicated to basketball that he'd play for 10 straight hours at the Coon Rapids YMCA.
By middle school the family had moved to Fridley. White friends would joke around and call him a racial slur. He knew they were joking but it still stung. It was around then when he started hanging out with students of color: "I was the intermediate between both crowds," he said.
As a star guard for Spring Lake Park High School -- a crafty lefty shooter who modeled his game after Chris Paul and Ray Allen -- he felt caught in a subtle but always present racial divide. Once, he got invited to a rich white kid's house in Blaine. He asked to bring his Black teammates. "Just you can come," the white friend replied. "And then," Williams recalled, "my Black friends would be like, 'OK, you're leaving us so you can go hang out with them?' " When he played country music in his car -- he loves Florida Georgia Line and Rascal Flatts as well as Tupac and Drake -- he'd switch to hip-hop if Black friends teased him.
He feels his race subtly affected his life. Like when he and his girlfriend were pulled over driving to a Christmas party in Brainerd; officers said his car smelled like weed, so they put him in the squad car and searched his car. (They found nothing and let him go.)
A pivotal moment came after high school, when he joined the Minnesota National Guard and went to basic training at Fort Jackson, S.C. Shortly before completion, he got in trouble for calling his mother. Cellphones are strictly forbidden, so Williams was told to either go home or start over. He went home. Soon he was on a basketball scholarship at Northeast Community College in Norfolk, Neb.
It is a decision he regrets.
"I probably would have still been in the Army full time if that hadn't happened," he said. "Just one little thing that trickles down so much."
---
On the evening the Minneapolis police station burned, Angela Williams knew her son was there. "Get home before it gets dark," she texted.
She awoke to a photo Bryce had texted her of him holding a Molotov cocktail.
She berated him. "This goes against his character," she said later. This was a man who once delivered 50 pizzas to homeless people. "It's like something snapped in his heart."
His first call from jail was to his mom. He said he was sorry, knowing he'd let her down. "I was just sad as hell," he said.
The months since have been a roller coaster. He was released on strict conditions. He lost 20 pounds during a stressful summer. He couldn't sleep. He lost close friends. One friend said Williams could no longer be a groomsman in his wedding. People made death threats on Facebook.
His son was born: Kalix Ezekiel, which means "God strengthens." He's working as a leasing agent for a St. Paul property management company, but he'll lose that job when he's officially a felon.
With time and prayer, he came to peace with what he did.
He blames himself, though he blames the system as well: "There were four officers that hadn't been arrested for killing a man when they easily could have just put him in the back of the police car. None of this would have ever happened. Know what I mean?"
He regrets what he did. But he also knows it's complicated, like everything about these chaotic times in America.
"Riots are the language of the unheard," Williams said. "That's what Martin Luther King says. And he's not saying he condones or approves of riots. He's saying riots happen because people who cause riots are being oppressed and aren't being heard. It was just the last straw, I guess."

THE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD: THE CHALLENGE OF A FAIR TRIAL FOR DEREK CHAUVIN ; THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS STRAINED AMID PUBLIC PASSIONS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS.

Full text: In December the Hennepin County District Court made public a questionnaire it was sending to prospective jurors in the upcoming murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.
To imagine giving honest answers to the court's lengthy list of queries -- posed, the court explains, in hopes the written exam will "help to shorten the jury selection process" -- is to understand why it might just take a little time to find impartial and unintimidated jurors for this case in this community.
It is to understand, in short, how staggering a challenge Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill faces in ensuring a proceeding that will actually deserve to be called a fair trial for Chauvin and eventually three other cops accused in the tragic and world famous death of George Floyd on a Minneapolis street last May.
The challenge is that many minds have long since been made up by the worldwide dissemination of the shocking initial video images of one part of Floyd's fatal encounter with the police, and by the way his story quickly became an emblem, symbolizing centuries of racial injustice and the long history of police mistreatment of Black Americans.
But justice for all can exist only if -- even in the most disturbing cases, when popular passions burn hottest -- criminal conviction requires that the specific criminal nature of individual conduct is proven conclusively. That is not guaranteed, even in this case.
At one point, the court's juror questionnaire for this case asks: "Under our system of justice, defendants are presumed innocent of the criminal charges against them. Would you have any difficulty following this principle of law?"
At another point, the court inquires: "From what you have seen, read, or heard, do you have a general impression of the defendants?" Choices are offered, ranging from "Very negative" to "Very positive."
Were it not for the heartbreaking context, the main "difficulty" your average Twin Citian might face over questions such as these would be not laughing out loud.
From the moment this agonizing incident burst into the public's consciousness, the presumption of guilt regarding these defendants -- the open-and-shut conclusion of guilt -- has been loudly declared by virtually every prominent public official who has addressed the matter. And a, well, "very negative" view of the defendants has been widespread, too, among public officials and community leaders, in news coverage and commentary (including on these pages) and everywhere else.
On May 27, 2020, a day and a half after Floyd's death, and before much of anything was known about the incident beyond the initial disturbing video of Chauvin pinning a handcuffed Floyd to the pavement, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey demanded that prosecutors file criminal charges against the officers he had quickly fired:
"Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?" Frey protested. "If you had done it or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now ... We cannot turn a blind eye ... I saw no threat ... ."
Minneapolis was soon in flames, and riots erupted in cities around the country. Two days later, presidential candidate (now President) Joe Biden weighed in on a campaign video, denouncing Chauvin for "an act of brutality so elemental, it did more than deny one more Black man his civil rights and his human rights. It denied him of his very humanity and denied him of his life ... ."
Gov. Tim Walz made comparable pronouncements in the early days, and in the middle of June he traveled to Duluth to commemorate the 100th anniversary of one of Minnesota's most shameful crimes -- the lynching of three Black circus workers from a downtown lamppost by a mob of thousands that had rushed to judgment over dubious allegations of rape.
"There is an unbroken line between what happened on that street corner 100 years ago right to George Floyd's murder on the streets of Minneapolis," Walz declared.
Now, ordinarily, "under our system of justice," as the court says, whether Floyd's death was a "murder" akin to a lynching is the kind of judgment a jury would make. And it would come only at the end of a careful, impartial examination of all the evidence, including the defendants' side of the case.
But Walz, Biden and Frey were joined in rushing to proclaim guilt in this instance by both of Minnesota's U.S. senators, the Minneapolis police chief and state public safety commissioner, City Council members -- and on and on and on.
Minnesota may need to consider whether there may be more than one disquieting similarity between Duluth 1920-21 and Minneapolis 2020-21 -- if merely that order was restored to Duluth's streets only when the National Guard arrived.
Walz has now mobilized the Guard to reinforce the Minneapolis police out of concern that Chauvin's trial could incite unrest.
Suffice it to say that much of our community, far from presuming the innocence of these defendants, may have been left unprepared to peacefully entertain even its possibility.
Of course, all the presumptions of guilt are chiefly based on the bystanders' cellphone recordings of Chauvin kneeling on the side of a handcuffed Floyd's neck for close to 10 minutes. We would be in a safer situation if the general public better understood that defense attorneys can and will raise questions about whether this painful image captured a deliberate and heinous criminal act that unambiguously caused Floyd's death. Voluminous public filings reveal numerous not-ridiculous disputes that may arise at trial.
First, there is the question whether the awful-looking restraint maneuver Chauvin used was actually authorized at the time, or at least not clearly forbidden. In the wake of Floyd's death both the Minneapolis City Council and the state Legislature moved to decisively outlaw police use of chokeholds.
The length of time Chauvin persisted in kneeling on Floyd's neck, despite pleas from bystanders and concerned questions from his fellow officers, will likely be key in the case against him. But a jury may be asked to also ponder this:
If the tactic Chauvin used was already a crime when he used it, why was there such a rush to change policies and laws to forbid chokeholds immediately afterward?
Another basic question that could become complicated concerns how Floyd died. From reports beginning in the early days of the investigation -- and in subsequent statements described in court filings -- it has appeared that the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office found no physical signs of suffocation on Floyd's body, while it did find the presence of heart disease and dangerous drugs.
The medical examiner's report lists the "Cause of death" as "Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression." A combination of causes is perhaps the best a lay person can do to understand what that means. And while classifying the "manner of death" as "Homicide," the report adds that "Manner of death is not a legal determination of culpability or intent, and should not be used to usurp the judicial process ... ."
As that judicial process continues, lawyers and expert witnesses will doubtless grapple in court over these and other points of dispute. There's no assurance how it will turn out, and maybe that's the point.
As the court's juror questionnaire puts it in another of its queries: "Under our system of justice, the prosecution has the burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Would you have any difficulty following this principle of law?"
When a legal proceeding is as emotionally supercharged as this one, and has taken on such enormous symbolic significance, leaders of the community would seem to have a particular duty to urge the public to remain calm and patient, to respect the processes of law, and to withhold final judgment until all the facts and arguments from all sides have been fairly examined.
It's terribly late for that message to be delivered in this situation. But late would be better than not at all.

Policing plans see two sides entrench: Groups have organized, and many brought case to Mpls. council meeting.

Full text: The latest gauge of public opinion over a plan to replace the Minneapolis Police Department revealed a deeply divided city, with nearly 100 speakers at a public hearing Thursday offering passionate and competing views.
The City Council invited the public to sound off on its latest plan to ask voters in November whether they want to create a new public safety department. But the beginning of the three-hour hearing was dominated by opponents, who said the proposed charter amendment was vague and didn't do enough to fix the problems that led to the killing of George Floyd last May.
"This is nothing more than a power grab," said Brandi Bennett, who called in to the virtual hearing Thursday afternoon. "This reeks of activism and not good governance."
As the hearing progressed, more people began speaking in favor of the new proposal, saying past efforts to change the department haven't done enough to stop police from using force on people of color or protesters raising concerns about brutality. They argue the city desperately needs a system that helps people get quick access to mental health and social services.
"It's no secret that the MPD has failed. An MPD training officer murdered George Floyd," said another caller, Khadar Muhumed, who added that he doesn't want to fear that police will target him because of the color of his skin. "The police are expected to protect and enforce the laws equally. … The MPD has broken the social contract."
Minneapolis has become a testing ground for proposals that would put an overhaul of the city's approach to public safety on the November ballot. In addition to the council's plan, a privately funded effort to gather signatures for a charter change kicked off last weekend.
As they debate the best ways to change the police force, city leaders are also facing pressure to combat an increase in violent crime and provide a sense of safety as the first trial in Floyd's death approaches.
The proposal, written by Council Members Phillipe Cunningham, Steve Fletcher and Jeremy Schroeder, calls for the city to create a new Department of Public Safety that "provides a comprehensive approach designed to address the connection between public safety and health by integrating various public safety functions of the city."
The proposal would change the city charter, removing the requirements to keep a minimum number of police based on the city's population and removing the mayor's "complete power" over officers' operations.
The latest version, revised after feedback from the city attorney, says the new department would be led by a commissioner appointed by the city's elected leaders. The department must include a division with police, but it could have other divisions as well.
Community groups on both sides of the debate have been organizing intensely, and many of their talking points were repeated in Thursday's hearing.
Many people who spoke against the plan said they didn't trust the City Council and feared requiring the department to report to "14 bosses" would weaken accountability and prevent the department from responding quickly in a crisis. Some said they felt council members were giving too much attention to well-funded activists who support their agenda and hadn't done enough to fulfill their promise to spend a full year talking to residents.
"The promise of 12 months of community engagement, there's been very limited opportunity for us to provide that, and yet it appears that you have decided on a path," said one caller, Al Giesen.
Many supporters of the charter amendments argue that the best way to solicit people's opinions about the future of the Police Department is to allow them to vote on it.
Another caller, Abdifitah Abdi, said, "We all deserve to have our voice heard on the issues that directly impact us. … Let the people decide."
City Council members are expected to discuss the proposal at the March 4 meeting of the Public Health and Safety Committee. After that, it would have many more steps before it lands on the November ballot.

City attorney wades into police debate: Opinion piece blasting department rankles many.

Full text: Minneapolis City Attorney Jim Rowader was only on the job for a few months when he waded into the contentious debate over the future of the city's Police Department after he argued in a newspaper opinion piece that officers' unwillingness to "take ownership of the culture they have created" posed a roadblock to reform.
In the Feb. 8 op-ed in the Star Tribune, Rowader wrote that he was spurred to take the city attorney job after the death of George Floyd in police custody last May, leaving an "extremely well-paid corporate gig" with Target.
"I was angry. I was scared. I was also eager to do something, anything, to help fix this problem that has vexed our city for longer than my wife and I have lived here," he wrote in the opinion piece. "Minneapolis police have unfortunately practiced inequitable policing based on the color of one's skin for too long -- decades at least. It has to stop, it has to change -- now, today, tomorrow and for good."
He also called on officers still with the department "to join us in wanting to bring about this change."
But the piece, written in response to an earlier op-ed from a retiring police lieutenant, rankled critics both inside MPD and out, who saw it as inappropriate coming from someone whose office works with police in charging low-level misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor cases, and regularly defends officers in lawsuits. Others wondered whether his words might turn off officers who wanted to see changes in the department, but felt under attack.
Attorney Fred Bruno said that Rowader's comments could put his office in the awkward legal position of defending officers whose actions he second-guessed publicly.
"I would take the position that Mr. Rowader has disqualified himself, and perhaps all attorneys under him, from representing city employees, having publicly trumpeted his antipathy toward his own clients," Bruno, who regularly represents officers, said in a statement. "This is, at a minimum, the appearance of impropriety; at maximum, it is a conflict of interest requiring the city to bring in outside counsel, at great expense to taxpayers, to do the job correctly and dispassionately."
It's not the first time that Rowader has publicly called out what he saw as a pattern of police mistreatment of people of color. In 2016, Rowader, who is a white Puerto Rican, blasted the department after being pulled over at gunpoint because his SUV matched the description of one involved in a shooting. He took to Facebook to question whether officers would have reacted as aggressively if the stop had happened in a white neighborhood.
"All of us who live outside of the poverty, inequity -- and crime -- in the heart of north Minneapolis should realize that life is very, very different in a very meaningful way for the everyday, law-abiding citizen there in north Minneapolis," he wrote on Facebook.
The episode caused a stir inside the department and the officers involved were verbally reprimanded after Rowader complained, drawing a rebuke from the police union which argued that the officers were simply doing their jobs.
When reached via e-mail on Thursday, Rowader said that he will "continue to vigorously defend the City's interests whenever needed," but otherwise declined to comment.
His latest remarks come at a turbulent time for the MPD since the in-custody death of George Floyd last May, which triggered a state investigation and prompted calls for the department's downsizing, or even disbandment.
Minneapolis could serve as a test case for how cities might reimagine public safety by prioritizing mental health care and drug treatment to prevent crime. One charter amendment would replace the MPD with a new Department of Public Safety and eliminate the requirement to maintain a minimum number of officers based on the city's population, while another community-led effort would create a new entity that would take a "comprehensive public health approach to safety."
Both proposals could go before city voters this fall. Former Hennepin County Chief Public Defender Mary Moriarty said that Rowader hasn't publicly outlined his priorities, so it's too soon to say whether he belongs to a recent wave of more progressive prosecutors who've taken office in cities like Los Angeles and Philadelphia, promising to tackle racial bias in the criminal justice system, charge police who misbehave and make other changes. He can play a role in holding police accountable by instructing his attorneys, who regularly review police body camera footage while prepping their cases, to flag bad behavior, she said.
"They are in a unique position to first of all point out to police leadership, 'Hey this isn't OK,' but also to say, 'We are not going to charge cases if we continue to see this particular behavior,' " Moriarty said. "I think we need to stop looking at this as just a police problem or law enforcement problem, because we're all part of a system that's allowed this to go on for decades."
Rowader (pronounced ROWW-der), 56, started as city attorney in August, taking over for Susan Segal, who left to become a judge on the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
Before taking the position, he spent 26 years at Target, most recently as its vice president and general counsel for employee and labor relations. He also worked for a private law firm and for the National Labor Relations Board.
Joe Nu±ez, who worked as an attorney for Target before leaving to become a partner at Vantage Law Group, said that colleagues thought of Rowader as a strong leader, but he also had the self-awareness to recognize when he needed help from his subordinates.
Justin Terrell, executive director of the Minnesota Justice Research Center -- on whose board Rowader serves -- got to know Rowader during the legislative battle over "Ban the Box," a 2013 bill that eliminated a criminal-history box on most private job applications.
Rowader didn't shy away from uncomfortable topics, Terrell said, recalling one community meeting in which residents grilled Rowader about Target's commitment to "Ban the Box." Rowader, he recalled, took it in stride, and showed a clear willingness to hear the community's concerns. Still, he said that he saw how some people might question Rowader's ability to run the city attorney's office, given his background in corporate law.
"I think people's skepticism of him and his background is legitimate -- I think people should pay attention to his outcomes and hold him accountable to that," he said.

House rejects fund for security in Floyd cases

Full text: The Minnesota House failed to move forward Thursday with a plan that could help fund security during the trials of former officers involved in the killing of George Floyd, despite police and sheriffs urging legislators to act.
House DFL leaders brought up the bill that failed by a 63-71 vote, with some Democrats joining GOP members in opposition. The politically fraught measure would create a State Aid For Emergencies (SAFE) account that could be used to cover other law enforcement agencies' costs if they help Minneapolis with security during the trials. Gov. Tim Walz proposed creating the $35 million fund to help any community that requests mutual aid from other law enforcement agencies and then is stuck with bills it cannot pay.
"All Minnesotans deserve to be safe in their communities while having the ability to exercise their first amendment rights," said the bill's sponsor, Rep. Carlos Mariani, DFL-St. Paul. "The trial of former officer Derek Chauvin is just days away, and we will continue working on a solution to deliver the necessary resources in preparation for this major event."
House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, moved to reconsider the measure in the future after it was rejected. House Democratic leaders also did not have the votes to pass the bill earlier this week.
"Today, we are specifically urging members of the Minnesota House of Representatives to pass the latest version of the SAFE Account bill," three associations representing law enforcement wrote to House leadership Thursday. "The Governor's SAFE Account proposal is an opportunity to work together, and policing in the coming months will be harder without its passage."
With jury selection in Chauvin's trial set for March 8, House leaders are not only trying to reach a compromise in their own chamber -- they must strike a deal with the Senate, which has a different plan. The GOP-led Senate passed its own bill this week that would divert some of the local government aid that a city receives from the state to cover the law enforcement bills, rather than create a state fund to pay for them.

Full text: Attorneys prosecuting former police officers for the death of George Floyd are asking the Minnesota Court of Appeals to intervene and overturn a judge's decision not to reinstate third-degree murder counts in the case.
The latest filing marks the fifth time Attorney General Keith Ellison's office has pushed back at a ruling by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who presides over the cases against the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's May 25 death. Three challenges were presented directly to the judge himself; two went to the Court of Appeals.
Legal scholars and veteran attorneys have said it's highly unusual to ask the Court of Appeals to intervene before a case goes to trial, and the court has already told prosecutors once that it would not second-guess the judge's discretion.
Prosecutors filed their second appeal late Friday, asking the Court of Appeals to review Cahill's rejection of their motion to reinstate a count of third-degree murder against Derek Chauvin and to add aiding and abetting third-degree murder for the first time against J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao. The filing was made public Tuesday due to the government holiday Monday.
"The District Court erred in preventing the State from amending its complaint to reinstate or add the third-degree murder charge against the four Defendants," wrote Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank and Special Attorney for the State Neal Katyal.
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. He had been charged with third-degree murder, but Cahill dismissed that count in October because the charge typically applies when a suspect's actions put others at risk and is not targeted at a specific person. It is commonly used to charge drug dealers in overdose deaths; veteran attorneys have said it would apply, for instance, to someone shooting indiscriminately into a moving train.
The Court of Appeals issued a 2-1 decision Feb. 1 upholding a third-degree murder conviction against former Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor in the unrelated 2017 fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, writing that the count can apply when "the death-causing act was solely directed at a single person and was not eminently dangerous to others."
That prompted prosecutors to file a motion Feb. 4 asking Cahill to reinstate the charge against Chauvin and to add it against the other three defendants, who are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. Cahill denied the motion in a ruling last Thursday, noting that the defendants' actions were directed at one person.
The defendants were arresting Floyd on a report that he used a fake $20 bill when they pinned him stomach-down in the street, with Chauvin kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes.
The count should be added, prosecutors argued in their appeal, because the evidence supporting the other counts also supports third-degree murder, and because of the Court of Appeals ruling in Noor's case. The Noor ruling has not yet become legal precedent because Noor's attorneys are allowed to challenge it by asking for a Minnesota Supreme Court review, which they have said they will pursue.
The appeal was filed hours after the Court of Appeals issued a rejection Friday of prosecutors' first request that it intervene.
Prosecutors in January asked the Court of Appeals to overturn Cahill's rulings ordering one trial in March for Chauvin and a second trial in August for his three co-defendants. Prosecutors wanted one trial in the summertime for all four defendants due to COVID-19 safety concerns, and asked the court to hold a hearing on the issue or to issue a writ of prohibition to stop the March trial.
Court of Appeals Presiding Judge Tracy Smith wrote that trial judges have discretion to make such decisions, and that prosecutors didn't provide enough evidence to compel intervention.
"We are not persuaded that these discretionary rulings present the type of legal issues that should be reviewed by way of a petition for a writ of prohibition, especially in light of the supreme court's guidance about prosecution pretrial appeals being disfavored and a showing of critical impact being required to obtain appellate review," Smith wrote. "Moreover, the state has not identified any case establishing that a petition for writ of prohibition is the 'proper procedure' for challenging a pretrial order."
The court is designed to deal with complaints about the trial process after a defendant has been convicted, legal scholars have said.
"The Court of Appeals is generally reluctant to second-guess decisions by a trial judge, things like scheduling of the trial," Richard Frase, a University of Minnesota law professor and co-director of the Robina Institute of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, said Friday before prosecutors filed their second appeal. "They also just don't want a constant stream of appeals questioning the trial judge. Trial judges have a lot of discretion to make decisions."
In November, prosecutors filed a motion asking Cahill to reconsider his ruling to livestream the trials because COVID-19 safety protocols would severely limit in-person attendance. In January, they also asked Cahill to reconsider his ruling splitting the trial into two and rejecting their request for a summer trial. Cahill denied both motions.
Thao's attorneys, Robert and Natalie Paule, filed an unrelated motion Monday accusing Ellison's office of leaking information and calling for the dismissal of the charges against their client. It was made public Tuesday.
They accused Ellison's office of leaking information attributed to anonymous law enforcement officials to the New York Times and Associated Press that said Chauvin was ready to plead guilty to third-degree murder last year until the deal was rejected by then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
"Using deductive reasoning, the leak had to have come from the State," Thao's attorneys wrote. "It is impossible to overstate the magnitude of this misconduct or its prejudicial effect on the defendants' constitutional due process rights of a fair trial."
Ellison denied the accusation.
"This is one convoluted conspiracy theory," Ellison said in a written statement. "It fantasizes that even before we took over the case, we somehow knew what then-President Trump's then-attorney general was thinking. It's completely false and an outlandish attempt to disparage the prosecution for seeking justice in the death of George Floyd.
"Had we been contacted prior to its filing, we could have debunked this bizarre theory from the outset and avoided this waste of the court's time."
Thao's attorneys asked for an in-person hearing within the next week and for Ellison, Frank and Katyal to attend. They asked that all attorneys on the case submit affidavits to the court declaring that they did not leak the information and do not know the source.
Cahill should dismiss the case against Thao or impose sanctions against prosecutors if they "directly or indirectly" leaked the information, wrote Thao's attorneys.

Police overhaul campaign launched: Aim is to replace Mpls. department with a public health-focused entity.

Full text: Well-funded police reform advocates on Saturday kicked off what promises to be a high-profile campaign to let Minneapolis voters decide the fate of the city's Police Department.
Yes 4 Minneapolis, a political committee, began collecting petition signatures to ask voters this November whether to replace the department with a new entity that would take a "comprehensive public health approach to safety." A coalition of progressive groups, such as Reclaim the Block and TakeAction Minnesota, are part of the effort.
The campaign illustrates the high stakes of Minneapolis' fall election, when voters will have a chance to reshape City Hall for the first time since the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. In addition to a possible referendum on the Police Department, the mayor's office and City Council seats will also be up for grabs.
The debate over the future of the Police Department is playing out during a dramatic spike in violent crime across Minneapolis and as city leaders prepare for the trials of the four police officers involved in the May 25 death of George Floyd.
Nearly three-quarters of registered city voters supported redirecting some police funding to social services in a Star Tribune/MPR/KARE 11 poll this August. Only 40% supported reducing the size of the police force, however.
"The 2021 municipal election will be pretty profound," said Corenia Smith, campaign manager for Yes 4 Minneapolis. "I think that we're making history here in Minneapolis. And having this on the ballot -- it's going to be huge."
Interest already extends beyond Minnesota. The Yes 4 Minneapolis committee is being fueled by a $500,000 grant from the Washington, D.C.-based group Open Society Policy Center, the lobbying arm of the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic group founded by billionaire George Soros.
The committee hopes to collect 20,000 signatures by March 31 to help ensure the proposed charter amendment gets on the ballot. Several City Council members are also proposing a similar referendum, though it could be paused if the citizen petition succeeds.
"We have a policing system that doesn't work for us and we need alternatives," said Rachel Bean, who was among the first signers Saturday at a frigid outdoor event in south Minneapolis. "I'm a social worker and I feel like we have lots of tools that we could try to create more community safety."
Gabriel Smith, another signer, said he is interested in seeing a larger conversation about what public safety can look like. "I think that there are a lot of situations that aren't helped when someone shows up with a gun," he said.
Signer Erik Edsten said merely reforming the Police Department hasn't worked. "I think it's time to try a new and radical approach to how we view policing," he said.
The Yes 4 Minneapolis petition would remove Police Department language from the city charter and create a public health-focused Department of Public Safety, "including licensed peace officers if necessary to fulfill the responsibilities of the department."
The group did not release specifics about how the new department would function. Smith said it will organize this summer around those topics.
"This is going to be a monthslong process … to really get to the root of what Minneapolis residents want public safety to look like," Smith said. "Because we all deserve to feel safe in our community."
Bill Rodriguez, a co-founder of the group Operation Safety Now, which opposes reducing Minneapolis police funding, criticized the petition for lacking detail.
"It's awful bad policy, because they don't have any kind of a specific plan," Rodriguez said. "Just like the council, they're winging it."
He believes there is not significant support in the city for defunding or dismantling the department. "This is not what the people are asking for," Rodriguez said.
Three City Council members have proposed their own amendment, which would also replace the department with a more holistic Department of Public Safety. Council Member Steven Fletcher, one of the cosponsors of that effort, said he doesn't believe there is a conflict between the two proposals. If the citizen petition were successful, he said his colleagues might not proceed with their similar proposal.
"This is all part of the same expression of wanting to make structural change to the way we approach public safety," Fletcher said. "It's taking a different form than the council's form, but I think that's OK."
In addition to TakeAction Minnesota and Reclaim the Block, the coalition behind Yes 4 Minneapolis includes the ACLU of Minnesota, the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, Color of Change, the Southeast Asian Diaspora Project and Minnesota Youth Collective, among others.
Open Society Policy Center spokesman Jonathan Kaplan said the group is a longtime advocate of policies that "ensure equal justice under the law."
"We support the exploration and development of alternatives to current policing practices through our grantees like Vote Yes 4 Minneapolis," Kaplan wrote in a statement. "We defer to their judgment about what makes sense with respect to law enforcement policies and what they need to achieve safe and healthy communities."

$6.4M released for more cops: The Minneapolis Police Department says it's down about 200 officers following George Floyd's death.

Full text: Minneapolis will hire dozens more police officers after the City Council on Friday agreed to release $6.4 million to bring on additional recruits.
The unanimous vote came eight days after Minneapolis police requested the funding, saying they had 200 fewer police officers available to work than in most recent years. The additional funding comes at a time when some City Council members and activist groups are pushing to replace the Police Department in the wake of George Floyd's death.
Minneapolis police said they began the year with 817 officers on their payroll, 60 fewer than the previous year. But, only 638 officers are currently available to work, the department said. Some officers resigned or retired early in the year, while another 155 remain on some form of extended leave.
With the new recruit classes, the city expects it will have 674 officers available to work at the end of the year, and another 28 working their way through the hiring process at that time.
An unprecedented number of officers quit or went on an extended medical leave -- many for PTSD claims -- after Floyd's death, rioting that led to the burning of a police precinct, and calls to end the city's Police Department.
In the months since then, some residents have begged city leaders to hire additional officers, saying they're waiting longer for responses to emergency calls amid a dramatic uptick in violent crime. Others have encouraged elected officials to dismantle the department, saying police haven't proven effective at reducing crime.
The mayor and City Council have traditionally approved funding for police staffing in the budgeting cycle. Late last year, the City Council, in one of its most assertive moves yet, created a new Public Safety Staffing Reserve Fund, which holds about $11.4 million for police overtime and recruit classes, money that can only be released with additional council approval.
Council members who supported the plan said they hoped to improve accountability and transparency for the Police Department.
On Friday, the council approved the funding without any discussion, though Council Member Jeremy Schroeder did ask the mayor earlier in the meeting for more details about police officer discipline.
Earlier this week, ahead of the final City Council vote, Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced that they were making changes to the hiring process.
Minneapolis police plan to update the application for recruits to include additional questions about whether they have ever lived in Minneapolis, whether they have degrees in criminology, social work, psychology or counseling, and whether they volunteer or participate in programs like the Police Activities League.
Deputy Police Chief Amelia Huffman said they hope the change "will help us to really feel confident that we are recruiting the kinds of candidates we want right from the beginning."
Those changes will go into effect next week, when the city posts openings for a new class of officers, who will begin late in the summer.
Three City Council Members -- Phillipe Cunningham, Steve Fletcher and Schroeder -- have written a proposal that would replace the Police Department with a public safety department that includes police and other services. It would also remove the mayor's "complete power" over city police operations.
Yes 4 Minneapolis, a coalition of local community groups, is also collecting signatures to try to get a similar proposal on the November ballot.
In addition to approving the police funding, the City Council also approved a nearly $230,000 contract with risk management company Hillard Heintze LLC. The company will produce a report analyzing the city's response to the rioting that followed Floyd's death.
"The review will help address gaps in service and provide a comprehensive narrative detailing the City's response to the civil unrest," the city auditor's office wrote in the request for funding.

Court won't review Chauvin trial rulings

Full text: The Minnesota Court of Appeals will not intervene in the murder case against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and postpone his March trial in George Floyd's death to the summertime as prosecutors had requested.
The court issued a unanimous ruling Friday stating that prosecutors had not provided enough reasoning to merit its involvement, and dismissed appeals by prosecutors to delay Chauvin's March 8 trial and to hold one trial for Chauvin and three of his former colleagues who are also charged in the case.
"The state has not established a basis for our review of the district court's pretrial orders," wrote Court of Appeals Presiding Judge Tracy Smith. "Because we conclude that these appeals must be dismissed, we express no opinion on the merits of the district court's rulings."
Attorney General Keith Ellison's Office filed appeals in late January asking the Court of Appeals to review rulings issued by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill that ordered Chauvin to be tried alone next month on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.
Prosecutors argued that the COVID-19 pandemic made it unsafe to hold Chauvin's trial in March. They asked the Court of Appeals to hold a hearing so they could argue their case orally, or, to skip a hearing and immediately issue a "writ of prohibition" to stop the trial.
The Court of Appeals rejected the appeals because prosecutors did not show that COVID-19 would have a "critical impact" on their ability to prosecute the case, the Court of Appeals has no "inherent authority" to intervene in the "interests of justice" and issuing a writ of prohibition is "an extreme remedy" limited to cases where the lower court has " 'exceeded its jurisdiction' " and no other options exist, Smith wrote.
Ellison's office could petition the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision. Ellison declined to comment on the possibility.
"We filed the appeal two weeks ago because the State must and will always act in the best interests of justice and the people of Minnesota," Ellison said in a written statement. "Seeking a continuance to protect jurors, court personnel, attorneys and defendants from the lethal COVID-19 virus was the right thing to do and we stand by it. As we have said all along, we will be ready to start the trial whenever the court deems proper."
Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, asked the Court of Appeals not to intervene.
Cahill had ordered one trial for Chauvin and a second trial in August for his three former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- because the county's largest courtroom cannot accommodate all four defendants and their attorneys at once due to COVID-19 safety protocols. Kueng, Lane and Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Cahill twice rejected prosecutors' motions to delay the March trial and to hold one trial for all four defendants in the summer, prompting the appeal to the higher court. Cahill has presided over all four cases and will preside at both trials.
Such rulings by the trial judge are discretionary, the Court of Appeals wrote.
"We are not persuaded that these discretionary rulings present the type of legal issues that should be reviewed by way of a petition for a writ of prohibition, especially in light of the supreme court's guidance about prosecution pretrial appeals being disfavored and a showing of critical impact being required to obtain appellate review," Smith wrote. "Moreover, the state has not identified any case establishing that a petition for writ of prohibition is the 'proper procedure' for challenging a pretrial order."
Smith acknowledged the importance of public health in light of the pandemic, but noted that the courts have implemented "significant, tested safeguards" that are in place as hearings and trials continue in the state court system.
The prosecution's move was unusual, as the Court of Appeals is designed mainly to review complaints from defendants about the trial process after they have been convicted. Legal scholars said the Court of Appeals generally does not like to intervene before a case has gone to trial.
"The Court of Appeals is generally reluctant to second-guess decisions by a trial judge, things like scheduling of the trial," said Richard Frase, a University of Minnesota law professor and co-director of the Robina Institute of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice. "They also just don't want a constant stream of appeals questioning the trial judge. Trial judges have a lot of discretion to make decisions."
Joseph Daly, emeritus professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, felt that prosecutors made a convincing argument to delay the trial because of the pandemic, but said Friday's ruling is consistent with the higher court's role.
"[Trial] judges are like a referee in a basketball game, 'Let's get going,' " Daly said. "They don't want to interfere with what judges do."
Frase and Daly said chances are low that the state Supreme Court would intervene.
"This is atypical … and if you try at the last minute to get them to intervene, it's going to annoy the trial judge, and you don't want to annoy the trial judge," Frase said.
All four defendants, who were fired, are out on bond.

Full text: The city of Minneapolis plans to reopen the intersection where George Floyd was killed, but not until after the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Mayor Jacob Frey and Council Members Andrea Jenkins and Alondra Cano announced Friday.
The intersection at 38th and Chicago must never "return to normal," Frey said, adding that a survey will be sent out in a few weeks for residents to vote on preservation options for the memorial.
"During the trial, we know that 38th and Chicago will be a very important gathering space for community. We don't want to take that away," he said.
At the same time, the mayor signaled that the city is willing to risk a confrontation it has avoided for months. He declared that the intersection cannot be allowed to be an "autonomous zone," and he is laying out steps to eventually reinstate two-way traffic and bus routes after the trial.
Marcia Howard, one of the most stalwart protesters occupying the intersection, said the elected officials' announcement Friday doesn't change anything for her.
"The police have had multiple incursions into this zone in a way to go back to status quo and defile the sanctity of this memorial," she says. "To be clear, this place is multiple things at the same time. It is a memorial, and it is a protest zone. But first and foremost, it is my neighborhood. And so I will continue to stand in my neighborhood, continue to stand in solidarity against systemic oppression, right here at 38th and Chicago. No justice, no street."
City leaders have felt increasing pressure to reopen the streets from business owners and residents. At Friday's news conference, Frey and others praised the memorial but also suggested they were ready to take control.
"Amid the darkness, the community came forward and they managed to shine a light on 38th and Chicago in a beautiful way to memorialize George Floyd," Frey said. "But the intervening months have been far less straightforward. Barricades that were originally placed at the intersection to protect both people as well as the public art are now in many senses used as a screen for illicit activity and have re-traumatized neighborhoods."
The city has been providing garbage pickup, snow and ice removal, and emergency vehicle access to 38th and Chicago. Frey says the intersection will now receive enhanced services, including police, but barricades will remain in place to maintain the space for community gathering and reflection.
"That intersection must open, and must open with an intentional and thoughtful and compassionate way," said police Chief Medaria Arradondo. "When we get to that point of reopening, the Minneapolis Police Department will play a role in that, but we will play a role in it in concert with the collaboration with our community stakeholders."
Cano said that she heard overwhelmingly from residents and business owners that they want both safety and justice for 38th and Chicago. "I feel good about the fact that we did make available more than $10 million, as the mayor and the council, for investments in this area that will physically move us towards racial justice. I have been very impressed with many, many groups and organizations that we have engaged with," she said. "So today, knowing that we expect a difficult month in March, and that the one year marker will come in May, we're here to stand together to say we're going to support our community through it."
Jenkins, the other council member whose ward encompasses the intersection, has been in regular contact with the leaders of the occupation. She said she wanted to see 38th and Chicago continue to thrive, and said reconnecting the intersection to the rest of the city will make that happen.
"2020 has been an extraordinarily challenging year for everyone, but even more specifically the people who have been really rallying around what has now become George Floyd Square, building community, and building a sense of togetherness," Jenkins said. "I think the tragic murder of George Floyd has really created an opportunity for people who have been marginalized, who have been left out of processes throughout our communities, and it's given people a chance to feel like they are contributing, they are making a difference. That is important and I absolutely support that."
The memorial, also known as George Floyd Square, sprang into existence after the fatal arrest of George Floyd by Chauvin and three other officers outside Cup Foods convenience store in May 2020. The intersection also became a hub of food drives and protest against the Minneapolis Police Department, occupied around the clock by a group called Meet on the Street, whose de facto leaders include Howard, Jeanelle Austin, Madi Ramirez-Tentinger. Protest medics with 612 M*A*S*H are another regular presence. They have held movie nights and block parties, and recently constructed an ice rink in the street.
Last August, Meet on the Street issued a list of demands in return for reopening the intersection, which include recalling Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, firing Superintendent Drew Evans of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, establishing a state office for the prosecution of police, investing $156 million in various community services over 10 years, freeing local man Myon Burrell (whose murder conviction was highly disputed and whose life sentence was commuted in December), and keeping the intersection closed until after the trials of Chauvin and three other officers involved in Floyd's death.
Howard, a former Marine and longtime English teacher who has been on leave from Roosevelt High School since Floyd's death, has been guarding the memorial 17 hours a day, including through this week's cold snap. She often keeps a solitary vigil, but has more than 100,000 followers on Tik Tok, where she posts updates. Howard previously vowed the city would have to reopen George Floyd Square over her dead body if the demands aren't met.
The mayor's declaration that the square will remain closed merely creates the impression that the city has given the protest zone permission to exist, Howard says.
Victoria Lauing, executive director of Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center, observed that a raft of community investments city officials listed, including the perennial Step Up youth internship program, were not new.
"Our stance has been to listen closely, to learn, to offer the resources that we have here that are unique," she says. "We've had to figure out different ways for people to be able to access our facility, we have to coordinate when we get deliveries, stuff like that. None of it has been insurmountable, we are still here."
Frey, Jenkins and Cano, calling for access for the 5 and 23 buses, have been negotiating terms over the last six months. The city has initiated a truth and reconciliation process examining structural racism in city policy and named 38th Street a city-designated Cultural District.
The City Council has also approved adding the commemorative street name of George Perry Floyd Jr. Place to Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th Streets.
George Floyd Square is home to a large collection of protest art, including a raised fist sculpture by Jordan Powell Karis, a black-and-white aerosol portrait of Floyd by Peyton Scott Russell and an iconic sunflower mural of Floyd by Xena Goldman, Cadex Herrera, Greta McLain, and others, which was featured during Floyd's funeral in June.

Cub Foods store off Lake Street reopening Wednesday: Another closed Cub, on Broadway, will fully reopen in April with a new name and community center.

Full text: The Minneapolis Cub Foods store off Lake Street that was looted and heavily damaged by rioting after the May killing of George Floyd will reopen Wednesday at 6 a.m.
The store at 2850 S. 26th Av. closed along with more than a dozen other businesses in the area, including two Aldi stores, Target and Family Dollar. Both Aldi stores reopened last year. Target reopened in November.
"The reopening of the 75,000-square-foot store represents our commitment to the community," said Cub Chief Executive Mike Stigers in an interview at the store Tuesday. "It's about a sense of hope and a beacon of positivity. What normally would have taken a year took six and a half months."
Several new features have been added in the remodeling after soliciting community input, including a global foods market with Mediterranean, Hispanic and Caribbean offerings.
A stand with tortillas made fresh daily will open in a few weeks. It will be a first among Cub stores.
The community wanted more openness, and more fresh products and meat choices, Stigers said.
About 20% more products have been added along with an expanded salad bar, meat and seafood department and refrigerated cases. An area for e-commerce orders and designated spaces for curbside pickup are new.
"I'm looking forward to the reopening," said Channing Gamble of Minneapolis as she shopped at the Lake Street Target on Tuesday. "I like Cub's variety and what I want is almost always in stock."
Store hours will remain the same at 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. The pharmacy will open Wednesday as well and a TCF branch in the store should be back in business within a month.
In June, Cub began operating a free shuttle to carry customers to and from the Minneapolis store in the Quarry. The following month, Cub opened a 13,000-square-foot community store out of a tent in the parking lot and maintained the shuttle service.
The temporary community market tent has closed and will be removed soon.
Cub officials did not indicate the cost of the remodel but in September, Short Elliott Hendrickson Inc. of St. Paul was issued a permit for $1.1 million for the project.
On April 4, Cub will fully reopen the Minneapolis store on Broadway, also damaged in the rioting. It will be renamed Northside Cub by community request and include space for a community center.
The Cub Foods off Lake Street is a franchised store owned by Jerry's Enterprises in Edina. Jerry's owns and operates several stores under its Jerry's Foods banner and 17 franchised Cub stores in the metro area.
Other businesses forced to close near Lake Street and Minnehaha Avenue due to destruction from rioting are making a slow comeback, according to Ingrid Rasmussen of Longfellow Rising, a community group that formed after George Floyd's killing.
Auto Zone has started rebuilding, the owners of Minnehaha Liquors plan to rebuild and several restaurants have relocated temporarily with hopes of returning, Rasmussen said. Arby's does not plan to rebuild due to concerns about unrest at the trial verdict.

Chauvin's attorney fights reinstating murder charge: Other motions proposing trial protocols were filed on behalf of ex-officer accused in George Floyd's death.

Full text: Prosecutors shouldn't be allowed to reinstate third-degree murder charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, nor should expert witnesses be allowed to liken George Floyd's death to the crucifixion of Christ, Chauvin's attorney argued Monday in court filings.
Defense attorney Eric Nelson filed several motions proposing a number of protocols at trial, ranging from blocking prosecutors and their witnesses from calling Floyd a "victim" to allowing testimony about his opiate addiction.
Most significantly, Nelson pushed back against a motion filed by prosecutors Thursday to reinstate one count of third-degree murder against Chauvin.
Prosecutors sought the reinstatement based on a Minnesota Court of Appeals split ruling earlier in the week that upheld a third-degree murder conviction against former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor for the 2017 fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Chauvin is scheduled to stand trial March 8 on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death last May. A count of third-degree murder had been charged against Chauvin but was dismissed in October by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill.
"The state has deliberately turned a blind eye to actual binding precedent which clearly establishes that [the Noor ruling] is not, in fact, precedential," Nelson wrote.
The charge could not be reinstated, Nelson argued, because the Court of Appeals' ruling hasn't yet become legal precedent due to a window of time that allows Noor's attorneys to challenge the decision. He added that the state's "reliance on [the Noor ruling] is misplaced, or, at best, premature. Its motions to reinstate or amend the complaint must, therefore, be denied."
According to Nelson's memorandum, Court of Appeals rulings are not final until 30 days after they are issued, and then only if the defendant does not petition the Minnesota Supreme Court to review the matter. Such a petition would delay the decision from being finalized.
If no one petitions the Supreme Court, the Noor decision would become precedent on March 3. If the high court is petitioned, the Court of Appeals' decision would not become precedent until May 2, Nelson wrote.
The Supreme Court does not have to review every matter brought before it.
Noor's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, has said he will petition the Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' decision. Plunkett also represents J. Alexander Kueng, one of the three other former Minneapolis police officers charged in Floyd's death.
Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are scheduled to be tried together in one trial Aug. 23 on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors also announced last week that they want to add third-degree murder charges to their cases. Their attorneys have not filed a response.
All four former officers, who were fired, are out on bond.
Nelson also argued that the third-degree murder charge did not fit his client's case since Chauvin's actions were specifically directed at Floyd alone, while the charge criminalizes "reckless or wanton" behavior that endangers others. Noor fired his gun in a squad car across his partner's body at a dark silhouette outside the squad car and in the direction of residential homes, Nelson noted.
In a separate document, Nelson filed several motions about trial matters, many of them without context. He did not return a message seeking comment Monday.
Among the motions, he asked for an order "precluding any expert from likening the death of George Floyd to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on the ground that such analogy is prejudicial." Nelson did not explain the issue.
Among several other demands, he asked Cahill to:
• Prohibit prosecutors and their witnesses from calling Chauvin the "defendant" or "accused";
• Compel prosecutors to share witnesses' criminal histories;
• Order prosecutors to disclose "the substance of conversations" between them and staffers in the Minnesota Attorney General's Office and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which together are prosecuting the case;
• Prevent testimony about a "blue line or blue wall of silence," when police are accused of protecting their own by not testifying truthfully -- an issue that was openly discussed during Noor's 2019 trial;
• Limit testimony about medical examinations of Floyd to the findings of Hennepin County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker, who ruled Floyd's death a homicide and that he died of cardiopulmonary arrest complicated by being restrained by police.
Attorneys for Floyd's family were critical of Baker's findings and released a private autopsy report that said Floyd died of asphyxia, the deprivation of oxygen. Defense attorneys have argued that Floyd died of a drug overdose complicated by pre-existing health issues.

Walz to activate Guard for trial: Mpls., St. Paul sought aid for Chauvin proceedings.

Full text: Gov. Tim Walz is activating the Minnesota National Guard ahead of the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in March.
The preparation of the National Guard is one of many steps the state is taking in anticipation of potential unrest around the trial, which is set to start March 8. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death last May.
Walz's new executive order, which comes at Minneapolis and St. Paul's request, allows the Guard to start preparing and coordinating to assist during the trial.
"There are some public safety events for which you cannot plan, and there are some for which you can. The upcoming trials of the former officers involved in the death of George Floyd have raised the potential of civil unrest in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and nearby communities," Walz said in a statement Friday.
State officials have been preparing for months for Chauvin's trial, along with the trial of the three other former Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd's death, who are scheduled to be tried together in August.
Walz said this week that in addition to peaceful protests, the trials will be a "magnet" for people who want to do more than just express their First Amendment rights.
Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington on Wednesday described how he started that day talking with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces about trial preparation, then met with Black church leaders in north Minneapolis about what they can do to protect their congregations and churches.
He said he followed that with a conference call with 213 chief law enforcement officers about how the state and dozens of local law enforcement agencies will work together to block crime during the trial.
The state's plan is different from how they handled civil unrest last summer, Harrington said, and they aren't asking officers from around the state to come to the Twin Cities to be riot police.
He said his message to outside agencies was: "If we do this the right way, you are going to come in and prevent crime and you are going to prevent disorder."
Harrington said apart from when the Twin Cities hosted the 2008 Republican National Convention, Super Bowl LII and the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, "It's never happened in my 40-plus-year career where we've had to pull together this kind of multi-jurisdictional effort to keep the peace. This is an exceptional time."
Walz has been pushing to create a $35 million fund that would be used, in part, to help reimburse local law enforcement agencies that send staff to assist in the Twin Cities during the trials.
The idea has gotten resistance from Republican legislators who say Minneapolis should cover such bills.
The state's coordination of hundreds of law enforcement officers from different agencies comes as Minneapolis' police force is down by about 200 officers.
The department reported it had 877 police at the start of last year, and now has just 638 available to work.
Walz noted earlier this week that when he puts National Guard troops on the streets of Minneapolis, they need to be accompanied by other law enforcement officers. He stressed that they must have a sufficient number of officers partnering with them during the trial.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey submitted a request last year asking that the Minnesota National Guard provide support around the March trial, Frey's spokesman Mychal Vlatkovich said.
Frey's office "has been participating in regular planning meetings with law enforcement agencies to help ensure strong and persistent lines of communication are open with all relevant partners," Vlatkovich said in a statement. "At the same time, our team has been working alongside the community to establish key outreach strategies before, during, and after the trial."
Walz's executive order is not effective until 15 days later. It states National Guard Adjutant General Shawn Manke, in consultation with the governor, will deploy the personnel, equipment and facilities necessary to coordinate and support public safety in the Twin Cities and other communities around the state.
It authorizes Manke to gather the goods and services needed for that work, and says the cost of providing National Guard assistance will be paid through the state's general fund.
The Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Homeland Security and Emergency Management team is coordinating support around the trials and assessing the need for other emergency assistance, the order states.

Full text: Minneapolis has about 200 fewer police officers available to work as the city tries to rebound from a violent year and prepare for more potential unrest.
In the short term, the city is seeking aid from other law enforcement agencies as it plans for the March trial for former officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with killing George Floyd.
To build up the ranks in the long term, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo is asking the City Council to release $6.4 million to hire additional officers.
"This presents operational challenges for me as chief," Arradondo said of the shortage, details of which were released Thursday, as he made his funding pitch. "We need the stability in the sworn workforce."
In the aftermath of George Floyd's death, rioting that led to the burning of a police precinct station and calls to dismantle the department, Minneapolis police officers began leaving or filing disability claims in unprecedented numbers.
When last year began, the department had 877 officers. This year, it started with 817 -- but only about 638 are available to work, according to department statistics.
The city said 24 officers left in January, many taking advantage of an early-retirement incentive offered as the city tries to trim costs amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Another 155 were listed on some form of extended leave, including many for PTSD claims.
Robin McPherson, the department's finance director, said it's difficult to predict how many of those officers might return "because we've never had these kind of numbers."
Based on how similar cases have unfolded in the past, McPherson said "there may be a couple [who return], but more than a handful -- probably not."
Faced with the shortage, Arradondo reorganized the department last year to focus primarily on responding to 911 calls as violent crimes such as homicides, shootings and robberies escalated.
Some Minneapolis residents have complained they're waiting longer for officers to respond to emergency calls and have formed their own safety patrols out of frustration. A group of North Side residents sued the city, saying it's not adequately staffing the police department.
The Police Department will soon face another challenge. The trial of Chauvin is expected to draw large protests, and many in the city are hoping to avoid another round of rioting.
In his budget proposal, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, included a $35 million emergency fund that would reimburse law enforcement agencies that help when cities require assistance in an emergency.
On Thursday, Republicans in the Minnesota Senate pitched a counterproposal that would reduce Minneapolis' state aid if the city was not able to cover those costs.
"I think the direction we're moving is much clearer, in that it's Minneapolis' responsibility," Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said, adding that he wasn't worried about having adequate security at the trial.
Mayor Jacob Frey's office, in a statement, expressed support for Walz's plan and said there "should be no room for partisanship at such a pivotal moment for our city, region, and state."
Spokesman Mychal Vlatkovich said the mayor and other city leaders have been working with the state on plans to prepare for the trial.
"That planning has taken into consideration current and future staffing levels in the MPD," Vlatkovich said.
While they try to address the immediate security concerns, the Police Department's longer-term fate remains in the balance.
In the past, some City Council members have pushed back on Arradondo's requests for funding, grilling him for more specifics about his plan for the department. On Thursday, they asked questions but the tone remained congenial.
Late last year, as they were finalizing the 2021 budget, City Council members trimmed about $8 million from the police budget, much of which went to violence prevention programs.
The council also created a new $11.4 million Public Safety Staffing Reserve Fund, which holds money for police overtime and many of the chief's desired recruit classes. To get the money, he needs approval from the City Council.
On Thursday, he asked for $6.4 million to begin recruiting additional officers, a process that occurs in waves and often takes close to eight months for each class. If his request is approved, the department predicts it will have 674 officers available to work at the end of the year and 28 additional officers working their way through the hiring process.
After some council members asked the chief about his plans for strengthening background checks for recruits or improving training programs, the committee agreed unanimously to recommend approval of the funding.
Council Member Steve Fletcher noted that during the recent budget cycle city leaders debated whether to set the "target level" of officers at 750 or 888.
"Obviously, these projections don't get us into either of those ranges," Fletcher said, "so I'm comfortable saying that, in the universe we live in now, this is a staffing approach that makes sense."
The final decision will be up to the full council, which meets Feb. 12.

Full text: A Washington County judge approved the divorce of Derek and Kellie Chauvin this week under secret terms due to the heavy redaction of court documents.
Washington County District Judge Juanita Freeman issued her order Tuesday under seal; a redacted version was made public Thursday.
Freeman ordered redactions in the case because of harassment and financial fraud allegations Kellie and Derek Chauvin faced. Most divorces and their settlements are public record unless a judge approves the parties' request to seal the documents.
The proceeding came under scrutiny after Kellie Chauvin filed for divorce two days after Derek Chauvin was charged with killing George Floyd on May 25, sparking speculation that it was a move to protect assets from civil litigation.
Two months later, attorneys for Floyd's family filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis, Chauvin and three of his former colleagues who assisted in Floyd's arrest: J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao.
That same month, the Washington County Attorney's Office charged Derek and Kellie Chauvin with nine felony counts each for allegedly failing to claim $464,433 in joint income dating back to 2014. They are scheduled to be tried in that case June 30.
Last October, Freeman rejected the first proposed divorce settlement drafted by Kellie and Derek Chauvin, citing possible fraud and noting that giving "substantially all" of one's assets to the other spouse can be an indication of such activity.
The proposal was heavily redacted under parameters Freeman set out last year to protect sensitive information in the divorce documents.
Kellie Chauvin's attorney, Amanda Mason-Sekula did not return a message seeking comment; she has not publicly addressed the matter. Derek Chauvin does not have an attorney in the case, and could not be reached for comment. He is out on bond in the Floyd case.
"Judge Freeman is placed in a difficult position," said divorce attorney Jack De Walt, who is not involved in the case but has reviewed the latest documents and previous filings. "On the one hand, you have a case that clearly has larger implications on both a state and national level. … On the other hand, you have two parties seeking a divorce, and the [judge] must have felt that the revised proposal … adequately addressed her previous concerns."
The judge's ruling this week was accompanied by a "stipulated findings of fact" document outlining the division of assets she approved. It was heavily redacted, making it impossible to determine the terms of the settlement.
However, the document shares the same date as a second proposed settlement filed by Kellie and Derek Chauvin in December that had been briefly made public. That proposal would have awarded Kellie Chauvin about two-thirds of their marital and nonmarital assets, including their homes in Oakdale and Florida. It would have awarded her all of their marital assets -- money and assets each earned during their marriage that state law encourages be divided in a "fair and equitable" manner.
Divorce attorney Marc Beyer, who is not involved but has reviewed documents in the case, said Freeman likely approved the December proposal. Court records show that Kellie and Derek Chauvin did not file another settlement plan.
"Either the court approves of the settlement or it doesn't," Beyer said. "If it doesn't, the matter would be set on for a contested hearing or further proceedings of some kind."
Veteran divorce attorneys have said an equal 50-50 split of marital assets is not required by law, and that judges have wide discretion.
"This Agreement was executed free from any duress, coercion, collusion or undue influence," said the document with Freeman's ruling.
State laws and policies promote settlements, which eliminate the need for court hearings and a trial, thereby saving the court time and money.
According to the December proposal: Kellie Chauvin's share of marital assets was $658,461; Derek Chauvin's share was an $8,862 debt.
Nonmarital assets, money and property earned before marriage, are commonly awarded to the earner. Derek Chauvin's nonmarital award was $429,630; Kellie Chauvin's share was $45,256.
Kellie Chauvin would receive $754,911 from Derek Chauvin's pension and three of his other accounts. He would receive $452,524 in nonmarital assets from the same accounts.
Derek and Kellie Chauvin married in 2010 and have no children together. They previously noted that they were not seeking spousal maintenance.
After all assets and debts are factored in, Kellie Chauvin would receive $703,717; Derek Chauvin would receive $420,768.
"On its face, you could say that it's surprising in that most people would advocate for a more equal division of the marital estate," Beyer said of the proposed settlement. "[Derek Chauvin] certainly could have gotten more of the assets had he pursued it, but I don't know what's motivating [him] right now."
Beyer said the judge could have been persuaded to award Kellie Chauvin more marital assets because of the amount of Derek Chauvin's nonmarital award and the impact his criminal case had on her.
The fact that Kellie Chauvin is not seeking spousal maintenance from Derek Chauvin could also factor into how marital assets were divided, De Walt said.
"It is hard to know what other conclusions to draw without seeing more the actual terms of the decree," De Walt said.
The December proposal said Kellie Chauvin lost her job as a Realtor last May and has been unable to work because of safety concerns. People protested outside their Oakdale and Florida homes and vandalized the properties. Kellie and Derek Chauvin were also stalked and were the victims of financial fraud, according to court documents.
The proposal said Kellie Chauvin received $12,996 in net profits from the sale of their Oakdale home, and was expected to incur unknown costs from vandalism to their Florida townhouse and other buildings in their association.
It also noted that she planned to legally change her name.
"The name change request is being made due to Petitioner's safety being put in jeopardy," court documents said.
Derek Chauvin is scheduled to be tried on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges March 8. Kueng, Lane and Thao are expected to be tried in one trial on Aug. 23. All four are out on bond.

Murder case on all Floyd officers?: Prosecutors seek to add third-degree charges, citing ruling against Noor.

Full text: Prosecutors sought Thursday to add third-degree murder charges against four former Minneapolis police officers in the death of George Floyd because of an appellate court ruling this week in the case of another ex-officer convicted in the 2017 death of an Australian woman.
In the case of Derek Chauvin, prosecutors want to reinstate the third-degree murder charge that was dismissed in October by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill. In the cases of the three other officers, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, prosecutors want to add the charge to their complaints.
Prosecutor Matthew Frank, acting on behalf of Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, cited a precedential state Court of Appeals ruling against Mohamed Noor, a former Minneapolis police officer, that was published Tuesday.
Noor is serving a 12 ½-year sentence for a third-degree murder conviction in 2019 for shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond from the passenger seat in his patrol vehicle as he and his partner responded to Damond's 911 call of a possible sexual assault.
On appeal, Noor's lawyer argued in part that he couldn't be convicted of third-degree murder because his actions were aimed at a specific person, rather than "eminently dangerous" to others.
Until now, the third-degree murder charge in Minnesota had generally been used against drug dealers in overdose deaths.
A three-judge panel was split 2-1 on the ruling. Judges Louise Dovre Bjorkman and Michelle Larkin found that a third-degree murder conviction can be upheld when the conduct is directed at a single person.
In a detailed dissent, Judge Matthew Johnson said he would have reversed Noor's murder conviction and sent his case for sentencing on the lesser second-degree manslaughter charge.
As was the case for Noor, a conviction of third-degree murder could lead to longer sentences for the former officers involved in Floyd's arrest, especially the three accused accomplices.
In Noor's case, had he been convicted of second-degree manslaughter, he likely would have faced a sentence of about four years, about a third of what he is serving now.
Frank said Cahill now has clear guidance on the elements of third-degree murder and he asked the judge to reinstate the charge against Chauvin and allow the state to add the charge against the other three.
Chauvin is currently charged with second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter.
The other three are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter.
When Cahill dismissed the third-degree charge against Chauvin last fall, he cited state law saying that "a third-degree murder charge can be sustained only in situations in which the defendant's actions ... were not specifically directed at the particular person whose death occurred."
Frank acknowledged there are differences between Noor's case, in which he fired a gun out a window, and those against the four officers who restrained Floyd.
"Noor's actions arguably put others at risk in addition to the victim, whereas Chauvin's conduct only directly endangered Floyd," Frank wrote. "But this distinction made no difference to the Court of Appeals. That court has now clarified that it is immaterial whether the death-causing conduct in Noor may have been directed at, or may have endangered, others."
The Court of Appeals ruling may not be the final word on what constitutes third-degree murder.
Noor attorney Thomas Plunkett said he will ask the state Supreme Court to consider the case. But the Supreme Court could refuse, which would allow the appellate decision to stand.
If the higher court takes up the Noor case, a decision would be unlikely to come this year.
Chauvin's trial is set to begin March 8, although Frank is seeking to postpone the starting date. The other former officers are scheduled to go to trial together in August.
Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson and Lane's lawyer Earl Gray declined to comment. Plunkett, who represents Kueng, also declined to comment. Bob Paule, who represents Thao, didn't immediately return a call.

Earlier video similar to Floyd takedown: Chauvin, Kueng and Lane shown aggressively detaining a Black man.

Full text: Three weeks before he planted his knee on George Floyd's neck, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin responded to a report of a woman being held hostage by armed men in a South Side apartment.
Along with officers Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Luis Realivasquez, Chauvin marched into the building as a Black man named Adrian Drakeford walked out. Drakeford was carrying an object the officers later said they thought to be a knife. Without a word, they tackled him to the ground outside the apartment building.
His brother Lee Drakeford started recording with his cellphone as he and Adrian's girlfriend, Kamaria Layton, pleaded that the officers were making a mistake.
"He didn't do nothing!" cried Layton.
Chauvin watched calmly and silently, tapping an object against his leg, as Kueng and Lane worked the handcuffs onto Adrian's wrists. Realivasquez eyed the crowd starting to amass and pulled a can of chemical irritant from his utility belt.
"Back up!" he ordered, shaking the can.
The video from May 3, 2020, obtained by the Star Tribune, bears striking similarities to footage showing three of the same officers -- Chauvin, Lane and Kueng -- aggressively detaining Floyd. As the officers handcuffed Adrian, bystanders begged them to show mercy. As with Floyd, the officers ignored the pleas. A few weeks later, Chauvin, Lane and Kueng would be fired and criminally charged in Floyd's death, bringing an abrupt end to Chauvin's history of rough encounters with civilians.
Adrian Drakeford was no hostage taker. The 27-year-old had no connection to the 911 call, other than living across the hall from where the woman said she was being held.
The policemen never found the 911 caller or determined whether she was still in danger. Instead, they detained Adrian and arrested one of his brothers, Terrance, who arrived on the scene and protested their treatment of Adrian. Lee -- the one recording -- ran away when they tried to detain him, too.
Adrian was released with no charges. Terrance was charged with obstructing the legal process. After reviewing the case, the Minneapolis City Attorney dropped the misdemeanor "in the interest of justice."
"It's not the style of policing you want to see any law enforcement practice," said Andrew Gordon, deputy director for community legal services at Minneapolis nonprofit Legal Rights Center, who represented Terrance. "Their interest is not necessarily about investigating a crime. … Their interest is to put these kids in their place."
Kueng and Lane were in their first few months on the force. This was part of their field training.
The video
When the video begins, Lane and Kueng have already pinned Adrian to the ground in front of the apartment in the 2400 block of Oakland Avenue.
"Ya'll see this? He literally walked out the door," shouted a bystander.
"Y'all are honestly throwing men to the ground?" another chimed in.
In an interview, Adrian said the officers tackled him from behind. He thought he was being attacked or robbed at first and struggled to breathe when they held him down.
The officers later acknowledged the object in his pants was a knife sharpener, not a knife. Adrian said in an interview his car had been broken into the night before, and he'd called 911 to report it.
"He been calling all day!" said Lee.
Lane and Kueng pulled Adrian to his feet. Chauvin looked on and walked with them to the squad. Lee continued to ask the officers for their badge numbers.
"He came out with a knife, dude," said Realivasquez.
"I didn't come out with no knife!" retorted Adrian as the officers pushed him into the squad.
"He didn't come out with no knife! I was watching," said Lee. "Ya'll just snatched him up."
Lee asked the officers why they had come, and they said they'd been called to "apartment number one." Adrian lived in unit three.
Adrian's other brother, Terrance, pulled up to the apartment with his girlfriend. There is no video to explain why the officers arrested Terrance, but in their reports, the officers say they "assisted [Terrance] down to the ground" after he shouted "foul language" and asked if they were "here to kill more Black people."
"When he said this I observed that there were children in the area and was [sic] listening to his foul language," the report states.
In an interview, Terrance said he was protesting the officers' treatment of his brother but that he was walking away when they arrested him.
A group of neighbors had gathered and were shouting at the officers. Among them, said Terrance, was the man who lived in the apartment the police had come to investigate. "They took me to jail and they didn't even investigate the guy they were there for," Terrance said.
The officers eventually released Adrian, acknowledging in reports he'd committed no crime: "After further investigation it was determined that Adrian Drakeford was not involved in this call. This whole call was unfounded because everyone on scene at this address was uncooperative."
Terrance, the only one charged with a crime, was released from jail on bail a couple of hours later. The Minneapolis City Attorney's Office dropped the charges on May 12.
Twelve days later, Chauvin pinned Floyd down for more than nine minutes while Kueng and Lane held down his legs. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death; Kueng, Lane and officer Tou Thao face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. Realivasquez was not involved. A Minneapolis Police Department spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
"The timeline here is troubling," said Gordon. "The same officers are involved in the murder of George Floyd, using some of the same techniques and the need and desire to control people."
Gordon wonders why the wrongful detainment of the Drakefords and failure to investigate the 911 report -- in addition to the litany of misconduct complaints leveled against Chauvin throughout his career -- didn't raise red flags and lead someone in a position of power to intervene on how these officers approached their jobs.
"This is not the first decision point where someone could have done something," said Gordon. "This was maybe the last one."

Chauvin attorney asks court to let trial proceed in March

Full text: The attorney for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged in George Floyd's death, is asking the Minnesota Court of Appeals to dismiss a plea from prosecutors to move his trial from March to the summertime.
Attorney Eric Nelson argued in a motion filed over the weekend that prosecutors missed a deadline to ask the Court of Appeals to intervene in the case. He did not address prosecutors' argument that moving the trial was an urgent matter of public health due to COVID-19.
"Respondent respectfully requests that this Court dismiss [prosecutors'] appeal as untimely and improper," Nelson wrote.
Nelson's motion was filed two days after Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is leading the prosecution, asked the Court of Appeals to rule on the trial date, and comes more than a month before Chauvin is scheduled to be tried March 8 on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in Floyd's May 25 death.
Ellison's office is asking the Court of Appeals to reverse orders Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill issued on Jan. 11 and Jan. 21 rejecting prosecutors' request to hold one trial for all four former officers charged in the case in the summer, when more people would be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Cahill instead ordered one trial in March for Chauvin and a second in August for the other three defendants -- former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, who are each charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter -- because the county's largest courtroom could not accommodate all four defendants at once due to COVID-19 safety protocols. The judge also ordered the trial to be livestreamed because pandemic protocols would severely limit the number of people who could watch the trial in person. Prosecutors resisted the move and unsuccessfully asked Cahill to reconsider his unprecedented decision.
Nelson's two-page motion was brief in its argument, noting that the Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure, state laws that govern the handling of alleged crimes and trial and court processes, provide a five-day window for appealing a judge's pretrial order once it is served on attorneys.
Prosecutors' plea for intervention by the Court of Appeals was filed 17 days after Cahill's first order, Nelson wrote.
"Nowhere in its Statement of the Case or Notice of Appeal does [the prosecution] claim it did not receive notice of filing of the [Jan. 11] order," said Nelson's motion. "The State's appeal … must, therefore, be dismissed as untimely."
Upon receiving Cahill's Jan. 11 order first laying out the two-trial plan, prosecutors waited eight days to file a motion to the district court asking Cahill to rescind the plan and return to a one-trial plan he initially laid out in November.
When Cahill rejected the prosecution's request in a Jan. 21 order, the state took seven days to ask the Court of Appeals to intervene, Nelson added.
Nelson last year filed a motion to postpone Chauvin's trial to an unspecified date in the summer in order to cope with copious evidence and because, he alleged, prosecutors had mishandled how they shared evidence with the defense, missing deadlines and providing materials in a confusing manner. Cahill denied the request; Nelson did not revisit the issues in his latest filing to the Court of Appeals.
Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank and Special Attorney for the State Neal Katyal have said several times that they are prepared to go to trial March 8, but argued that holding one trial in the summertime would prevent creating a COVID-19 superspreader event and would avoid a possible mistrial should a participant contract the virus during the March trial.
Prosecutors requested a hearing so they could argue their case orally, and also asked the Court of Appeals to skip a hearing and immediately issue a "writ of prohibition" to stop the March trial. The prosecution's move is unusual, as the Court of Appeals is designed mainly to review complaints from defendants about the trial process after they have been convicted.
All four defendants are out on bond.

Full text: While awaiting the start of "Twelve Blocks From Where I Live," which is kicking off a cabaret series that Theater Latt Da describes as "stories and songs in the meantime," I pondered the word "meantime." Latt Da intends these virtual shows to entertain us until it's safe to gather for live theater, but there's no getting around the fact that the past several months have sometimes felt like a very mean time.
"Twelve Blocks From Where I Live" finds actor Regina Marie Williams shifting between the natural beauty she observed near her south Minneapolis home last summer and the ugly events that occurred the titular distance away on May 25, when George Floyd died at the hands of Minneapolis police. Throughout the half-hour program she also discusses the violence that occurred in response to the killing, but she seems inclined to focus on beauty: birds in flight, people feeding each other, peaceful protests.
Accompanied by the musical trio of Sanford Moore, Jay Young and Steve Jennings, Williams opens with a passionate "Make Them Hear You," from "Ragtime," standing on the same Ritz Theater stage where Latt Da produced the show in 2016 and where Williams last performed for a live audience, playing the title role in "Bernarda Alba." A song about the importance of giving voice to the stories of the oppressed, "Make Them Hear You" is an inspired choice that becomes even more meaningful when Williams' soaring vocal is paired with her images from the area now known as George Floyd Square, including a concluding photo of a sidewalk near where he died.
Throughout the program, Williams' images share space with songs, which also include her "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free," a civil rights anthem usually associated with Nina Simone, whom Williams played
in multiple productions of Park Square Theatre's "Four Women," as well as a slightly altered version of the Doobie Brothers' "Takin' It to the Streets," on which she's joined by Latt Da vets Thomasina Petrus and Aimee K. Bryant.
The latter two also get solos, Petrus on "What a Wonderful World," which she injects some church into by mashing it up with "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands," and Bryant on "Easy to Be Hard," the showstopper from "Hair."
It makes for a promising start for Latt Da's five-part "meantime" series, which is dubbed the Ghostlight Series and will include "Heroic Acts of Music" and "Re-cast." Yes, I know "meantime" is the usage of "mean" that refers to something like "in the middle," but even so, the message of hope in "Twelve Blocks From Where I Live" does make the world feel a bit less mean.
