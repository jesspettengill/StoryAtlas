Full text: Spencer Puckett has had to close his south Minneapolis store several times this year, first because of coronavirus restrictions in the spring and then because of damage from riots following the police killing of George Floyd.
His apparel business, Captain Rebel, is one of 17 businesses owned by women or people of color that will reopen in a storefront at Mall of America called Community Commons while rebuilding efforts continue in their former locations.
The mall is making the space available for free to the tenants for at least six months, including the normally busy holiday shopping season.
"We recognize these businesses have [gone] through a tremendous amount of hardship, whether they were directly impacted physically from the arson or the looting destruction that was taking place or just that sense of lost business," said Jill Renslow, MOA's executive vice president of business development and marketing.
The physical damage was on top of business issues caused by the pandemic, she said.
"It's a great opportunity," said Puckett, whose business sells jackets, hoodies and other apparel. "I didn't expect for them to do something like this."
Starting Thursday, Captain Rebel and the other businesses will be in a 5,000-square-foot space on the second floor where a Riley Rose store was.
The Minneapolis and St. Paul businesses will feature a variety of products from clothing and accessories to art and prepackaged food.
Puckett, who is Black, had been interested in opening a store in the mall, but then the pandemic hit and business slowed.
"This shows me if I can really open my own [mall] store," Puckett said on Tuesday as he made his way
from MOA across the street to Ikea to grab some more hangers for his store display.
Jasmine McConnell, owner of Butters By Jay, said the free rent at the Community Commons was a major relief that allows her to focus on getting her brand more exposure.
"There are so many larger stores that are well known in the Mall of America," said McConnell, who also is Black and sells collections of shea butter, bath bombs, soaps and scrubs. "To give 17 vendors the opportunity to be on that same platform -- and it's free -- it's the biggest opportunity ever."
In June, the mall started reaching out to community groups to figure out how it could partner with small businesses hurt by the civil unrest that erupted after the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.
Floyd's death sparked international outcry and protests against police use of force, as well as riots. In the Twin Cities, hundreds of businesses including small, locally owned stores had doors or windows broken or were looted or set afire.
The mall selected Knock Inc., a women-led creative agency, to come up with the Community Commons concept and branding and help with the store's design.
Knock is doing the work pro bono and also has helped some of the tenants with merchandising and logos, said Reginaldo Reyes, vice president of brand experience and environmental design for the agency.
"There is a physical connection with business owners that you don't get unless it's in this market concept, where you are actually talking to the makers or the person who is buying the product," Reyes said.
It's not the first time MOA has experimented with pop-up retail.
The mall launched a RAAS (retail as a service) market of local makers in late 2017 and has had different iterations of the project. The most recent version, called Fourpost, offered physical space for retailers that had mostly sold their products online.
Fourpost closed early this year and transferred to Triple Five Group's American Dream mall in New Jersey. Triple Five also owns Mall of America.
Last month, MOA announced Minnesota Transitions Charter School would open temporarily in the mall after its offices and school were damaged in the spring riots.
The plan is for Community Commons to stay open through the end of March, though it's possible the space could remain, either with current businesses or rotating in other retailers.
This week, the businesses were setting up the space, which will include artwork the mall commissioned from the nonprofit youth art and design center Juxtaposition Arts.
While helping other businesses suffering from the pandemic, the MOA has its own financial issues because of the economy caused by the pandemic.
At the beginning of the month, the mall announced it planned to lay off more than 200 people and might have to extend the furloughs of nearly 180 more.
Because of the mall's closure during the onset of the pandemic, Triple Five has fallen several months behind on the megamall's mortgage. The mall's loan was transferred to special servicing, and the mall's owners have entered into a cash management forbearance agreement that includes increased reporting requirements and monthly remittance of cash.

Full text: A majority of likely Minnesota voters -- 56% -- feel the criminal justice system does not treat Black people and white people equally, according to a new Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota Poll.
The Minnesota poll also found that about half of respondents think civilian violence against people and property in U.S. cities is a bigger problem right now than police violence against Black people nationwide.
Meanwhile, 42% of likely voters now have a favorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement.
The poll follows a summer of civil unrest in Minneapolis and other cities across the country, where protesters marched in response to the death of George Floyd and other Black people at the hands of police. In the Twin Cities, rioters set fire to a police precinct and damaged hundreds of buildings.
The Minnesota Poll's findings are based on interviews with 800 likely Minnesota voters that were conducted between Sept. 21 and Sept. 23, four months after Floyd's death. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Opinion has shifted substantially from 2016, when the Minnesota Poll found only about a third of likely voters thought the criminal justice system treated white and Black people unequally.
While 36% responding to this month's poll said they felt Floyd's death was an isolated incident, about half of voters said they felt it was a sign of a broader problem in the treatment of Black people by Minneapolis police.
"I feel like they respond in different ways based on the person that they're potentially going to apprehend," said Derek Landseidel, a 29-year-old teacher from Minneapolis who responded to the poll. "That would indicate that they have some sort of implicit bias, which I know is not a word cops like to hear."
Landseidel, who is white, said everyone has bias -- including teachers -- but people get defensive when they hear it. Public servants, he said, should especially listen.
"If you know you have it, be receptive to changing that," he said. "Even as teachers we have to … identify the problems that we have internally."
Poll responses for some questions on race and justice differed widely by location: 70% of respondents living in Hennepin and Ramsey counties said the justice system does not treat Black and white people equally, for instance, compared to 54% in the suburbs.
And respondents in northern and southern Minnesota were more apt to say that civilian violence is a greater problem than police violence against Black people: 65% in northern Minnesota, 60% in southern Minnesota, 55% in metro suburbs and 36% in Hennepin and Ramsey counties.
Tom Richgels, who lives in the south metro, said he believes there are bound to be all types of people in police ranks -- including some racist officers -- but measures are in place to deal with them appropriately. Richgels said he does not believe that the justice system in general is "systemically out to get Black people."
"I think absolutely it has been in the past … there was legal oppression or there was legal discrimination against Black people for a long time in many different forms," he said. But today is different, he added: "Show me a law today that says 'you can do this if you're white but you can't do it if you're Black.' Show me one, and we'll fight to have that law abolished."
Richgels said he is more disturbed by civilian violence against people and property in U.S. cities.
The video of George Floyd's death is "a pretty horrible thing to watch. … I totally get the outrage and the protesters … it created a lot of emotion and anger and frustration and rightfully so, I think," Richgels said.
But, he said, statistically, it was an isolated incident.
"I just think we've gotten away from reality and I think the protesters who are committing crimes and being violent are doing so under a false narrative that quite frankly is a lot, a lot, a lot of political stuff going on right now. Everything's being politicized because we've got the elections coming up. … I get frustrated seeing towns get destroyed."
Jodi Olson, a 52-year-old heavy-equipment mechanic from Hibbing, said he responded that he views the Black Lives Matter movement unfavorably after hearing recently that a Chicago BLM organizer was quoted as saying she didn't care if someone looted a Gucci or Macy's or Nike store "because that makes sure that person eats. That makes sure that person has clothes. That is reparations. Anything they want to take, take it because these businesses have insurance."
Olson, who is white, said destroying property is wrong no matter who does it.
"At one time I think they were on the right track, but somehow they got some radical people in there and now they've veered off the track of what I think what their original mission and goal in life was," Olson said.
Litchfield resident Robert Eddy, a retired IT specialist, said he viewed the Black Lives Matter movement favorably because he believes it was formed to send a message about inequality.
But, Eddy, 72, said that from his perch in a predominantly white, rural community, he was unsure how much the group could be linked with the violence that spun out of some protests, just as he was unsure whether the justice system treats people equally.
"I really don't have any experience to say one way or the other. … I don't see that [unequal treatment] and I watch some of the court action, but I don't see anything that says that there's anything incorrect about the way they operate," said Eddy, who is white. "Maybe I could say I don't think so here, but I don't know about other places where the population is different."
North Minneapolis community organizer Roxxanne O'Brien said she was surprised the statewide poll results didn't show a higher percentage of people seeing inequity in the justice system.
O'Brien, who is Black, said the education system and media often aren't teaching people the truth, but are instead using narratives aligned with white supremacy. Answers to poll questions will depend on a person's background, she said.
"It's hard for people to be aware of issues if they can't empathize, if they haven't had the actual experience of being treated unjustly," she said. "If you don't have to experience it, then you don't really know. You don't have to know."

How the poll was conducted
Today's Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 Minnesota
Poll findings are based on interviews conducted Sept. 21
to Sept. 23 with 800 Minnesota voters who indicated they
were "likely to vote" in the November general election. The
interviews were conducted via landline (28%) and cellphone
(72%). The poll was conducted for the Star Tribune, Minnesota
Public Radio News and KARE 11 by Mason-Dixon Polling
and Strategy Inc.
Those interviewed were randomly selected from a phonematched
Minnesota voter registration list that included both
landline and cellphone numbers. Quotas were assigned to
generally reflect the state's voter turnout distribution by
county.
The margin of sampling error, according to standards customarily
used by statisticians, is no more than plus or minus
3.5 percentage points. This means there is a 95% probability
that the "true" figure would fall within that range if all voters
were surveyed. The margin of error is higher for any subgroup,
such as a gender or age grouping.
The self-identified party affiliation of the respondents is 38%
Democrats, 34% Republicans and 28% independents or other.

Full text: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter and a top White House adviser, made a surprise visit to north Minneapolis on Thursday as part of a Midwest tour to highlight what Republicans say is growing lawlessness in Democratic-controlled cities.
The two met with Flora Westbrooks, whose North Side salon burned down in the riots that followed the police killing of George Floyd in May. Speaking at the Airport InterContinental Hotel later, Westbrooks recalled the crushing feeling she had when her son called her to say that her 35-year-old business was on fire. She said she raced to the scene, but it was too late.
"It was horrible to stand there and see your business burn, everything you worked for," she said. "I just want my business back."
Her story amplified the Trump campaign's focus on the urban unrest that has rocked Minneapolis and other American cities in the wake of Floyd's death amid a broader reckoning on racial justice.
Several other business owners joined Westbrooks onstage, each with their own story of frustration with the violence and destruction that wracked the Twin Cities in the days after Floyd's death. Lloyd Drilling, owner of Thurston Jewelers, recalled watching helplessly as looters broke into his store. He called 911 only to be told that police couldn't respond because they were "basically overwhelmed by the situation."
Long Her said he wept when he found that someone had stolen a safe containing $10,000 from his fashion store along University Avenue in St. Paul.
Billed as a "Cops for Trump" listening session, Thursday's event featured the testimony of one law enforcement officer, Matt Hagen, a Hennepin County sheriff's deputy and president of the state Fraternal Order of Police. Hagen said police were feeling besieged and that calls in Minneapolis to cut their funding would only undercut law enforcement's ability to fight crime.
"One of the first things that they're going to have to cut is training," said the 21-year agency veteran. "You start cutting funding, we're going to be less trained."
Several members of the Minneapolis police union were at the rally but didn't speak. Among them was Minneapolis Police Federation President Lt. Bob Kroll, who made headlines last year selling "Cops for Trump" T-shirts in defiance of a department directive banning officers form wearing their uniforms in support of candidates at political events or in ads.
Earlier in the afternoon, the vice president's motorcade had pulled into north Minneapolis for an unannounced tour after leaving a campaign stop in Eau Claire, Wis.
Ivanka Trump, U.S. Labor secretary Eugene Scalia and Pence were shown around by a visibly emotional Westbrooks, whose voice trailed off before she pointed to the rubble-filled lot where Flora's Hair Design used to be.
"I came here in the morning it was here. I came back at 5 o'clock, it was ..." she said.
"We're with you," Pence said.
At the event later that afternoon, Pence promised to help her rebuild the business.
"American people want us to stand by law enforcement and stand by our African American neighbors and others who've been impacted by the violence across our country," he said. "It's not an either-or."
Speaking to the Star Tribune afterward, Westbrooks said the day had been a whirlwind of interviews, and she wasn't quite sure how she'd been chosen to participate in the fanfare. She said Pence and Ivanka Trump had been kind to her.
Pence's visit follows a campaign stop by the president at the airport last month, during which he met with other small-business owners whose stores were damaged in the protests after Floyd's death. Minnesota has emerged as a potentially key battleground in the November election.
On the campaign trail, Trump has seized on protests over racial injustice to promote his "law-and-order" message and position Republicans as a force of stability, following a playbook that Republicans have used in past presidential elections. Although most protests have been peaceful, Trump has repeatedly criticized protesters and activists on the stump, saying they make America less safe.
Minneapolis leaders have also drawn the president's ire at several public appearances, with Trump accusing them of failing to prevent widespread destruction while talking of cutting police budgets and abolishing the city's police force.
Before Pence's visit, Gov. Tim Walz activated 100 state National Guardsmen in anticipation of protests surrounding Pence's campaign stop.
"Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of Minnesotans, we have asked the Minnesota National Guard to assist in keeping the peace," Walz said in a statement. A spokesman for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirmed that the mobilization followed a request by Minneapolis city officials to head off any potential unrest.
But only a handful of protesters, some clutching handmade signs, showed up in the area around the hotel, which was tightly controlled even by already strict airport standards. A lineup of parked Metropolitan Airports Commission trucks formed a blockade in front of the hotel. After Pence's arrival a lone protester carrying a Biden 2020 sign was allowed to stand on the median outside the hotel under the watchful eye of several bicycle cops.
The visit came a day after a Kentucky grand jury looking into the death of Breonna Taylor indicted one former police officer on charges of shooting into neighboring apartments but did not choose to indict any officers directly in her death. The decision sparked protests nationwide Wednesday night, including in St. Paul, where demonstrators briefly shut down Interstate 94.
Pence briefly addressed Floyd's killing.
"I want to be clear, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd and justice will be served," he said to a smattering of applause.
The applause grew louder when he mentioned that rioters and looters would be "held accountable to the fullest extent of the law."

Full text: To patrol a smoldering city in the two weeks after George Floyd's death, Minneapolis shelled out more than $3.3 million in police overtime costs -- about 37 times more than normal, pushing the department past its annual budget.
The state's largest police force tapped 822 of its 855 sworn officers to pull extended shifts during that pay period starting the week of May 25, when the department averaged more than 3,600 overtime hours per day, according to a Star Tribune analysis of payroll data.
"It was all hands on deck," police spokesman John Elder said of the riots that engulfed south Minneapolis in May. "We had people working 18 and 20 hours a day."
A bystander video of Floyd's death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer sparked days of civil unrest, looting and arson on Lake Street, culminating on the third night with the destruction of the Third Precinct.
Amid the chaos, police struggled to find the manpower required to restore order in a city consumed by rage and grief. Department brass relied heavily on overtime to maintain adequate staffing levels as 911 calls surged.
Chief Medaria Arradondo worked round-the-clock monitoring the situation while his officers worked the streets throughout the night, Elder said, noting that Arradondo kept Mayor Jacob Frey apprised every step of the way. "What were our options?" Elder asked, recounting the decisionmaking process. "From what I saw, it was necessary."
At least three police sergeants logged 130 hours of overtime on their June 6 time sheet -- equivalent to around $10,000 in extra income, according to payroll data obtained through a public records request. The data provided to the Star Tribune listed the number and type of hours logged by all sworn officers in every pay period between April and June. It does not specify how many they worked each day or include overtime by civilian staff.
Those veterans were among nearly 200 Minneapolis officers who clocked at least 80 additional hours during the immediate aftermath of Floyd's death, which averages out to at least 10 hours per day for 14 days.
Nearly one-quarter of the rank-and-file officers have since contacted an attorney seeking disability benefits related to post-traumatic stress disorder.
Costs directly associated with the unrest exceeded the Police Department's overtime budget by about $3.5 million, said Robin McPherson, the agency's finance director.
City leaders had allocated $4 million in police overtime for the entire year.
Three months later, it's still unclear exactly how Minneapolis will foot the bill.
Unanticipated overspending could potentially be offset by underspending within another department, said Micah Intermill, city budget director. But if there is no extra revenue to cover the difference, the city will likely turn to its rainy day fund -- a $40 million reserve of unobligated general fund cash, of which leaders are already borrowing $8 million to balance the budget.
"It's messy, to be sure," Intermill said. "But there are a number of paths we can go down to make sure expenses are covered at year-end."
An economic crisis fueled by the coronavirus pandemic left city leaders scrambling to cut costs this summer in anticipation of a $156 million revenue loss.
Some of those cuts affected the Police Department, which was initially slated to have about a $193 million budget for 2020. Elected officials estimated in late July that they had saved about $8.6 million of that when they implemented a citywide hiring and wage freeze. Around that same time, in their first major budget negotiations following George Floyd's death, the mayor and council agreed to cut another $1.5 million from the department's budget, much of which got moved to the Office of Violence Prevention.
Around 145 civilian Police Department employees and appointed staff, including Arradondo, agreed to take four to six unpaid furlough days. Sworn personnel and members of the Fire Department were not subject to the furloughs because their bargaining units did not reach an agreement with the city.
Since Memorial Day, the police force has lost more than 10% of its officers through resignation, termination, retirement or medical leave. Depleted staffing levels amid a surge in violent crime and intense political debate over the Police Department's future has slowed emergency response times throughout the city and sunk morale.
Frey's 2021 budget proposal anticipates further departures and a continued reliance on overtime to fill the gaps. The Police Department projects it will spend an additional $5 million above its allotted $3.5 million in overtime costs next year -- a figure several council members say is not sustainable long term.
City Council Member Linea Palmisano, who serves as chair of the council's budget committee, stressed that while she doesn't want to cap the amount of overtime police can work, the department shouldn't get a "blank check" from the council. But Palmisano fears staffing is already precariously low for a city the size of Minneapolis, where on some occasions only eight officers are expected to patrol an entire precinct.
"There's not a lot of fat there to cut," she said of the department's budget, noting that 80% is earmarked for employee salaries and benefits.
Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, one of the chief proponents of dismantling the Police Department, questioned whether the city should continue authorizing unprecedented levels of overtime when there's a perception within the community that officers are shirking their duties.
"When you have a surge of a lot of people saying the same thing, that's notable," Ellison said.
Police officials have balked at allegations of a deliberate work slowdown, countering that patrol cars are stretched and officers are stuck in a constant reactionary mode because of the sheer volume of calls.
"Officers continue to come in and work every single day. You're not seeing the 'Blue Flu,' " Elder said. "We're doing the absolute best we can with the resources we're given."
For others, the situation is further proof that the city must find ways to shift certain responsibilities away from the police.
"We can't keep asking them to do more with less and less and expect to get good results," said Council Member Steve Fletcher. "We have to transfer some of their work."

Floyd's death inspires 'video meditation': "How Many Breaths?" will premiere online Sunday.

Full text: Special to the Star Tribune
It was May. George Floyd had just been killed in Minneapolis and violinist Ariana Kim was on a road trip from New York to the Twin Cities, to quarantine from the coronavirus with her family.
"And as I drove, with every hour there were new interviews and audio clips about George on the radio. And I just felt: When is enough going to be enough?"
Kim joined the street protests against Floyd's killing and visited the memorial site, but her own rage clamored for more personal expression.
"I felt I had to do and say and create something. To honor George Floyd, to create peace and inspire unity. I kept asking myself how I could do that."
The answer is "How Many Breaths?," an 18-minute video meditation "in memory of George Floyd and countless others," with music by Twin Cities composer Steve Heitzeg and a spoken text by Penumbra Theatre artistic director Sarah Bellamy.
Kim herself is the violin soloist in Heitzeg's jaggedly expressive score. It premieres Sunday on the website of the Chamber Music Society of Minnesota, where Kim is co-artistic director.
Kim grew up in Minneapolis, just 12 minutes from where Floyd was killed. Her father was a Korean immigrant, so she is no stranger to bigotry, and has watched with consternation the tally of Black people killed in police incidents.
With Floyd, though, Kim felt something was radically different.
"The killing was captured so completely and so vividly on film, there's no gray area," she said. "And as many more people than usual were at home because of the pandemic, we had the time and space to react to the killing, to be a community and to express rage."
That's felt in Bellamy's text, which is raw and emotional, especially as voiced by Bellamy and her father Lou, Penumbra's co-founder.
"It was a purging of grief and rage, and an outpouring of love for my Black community and for the Floyd family," Bellamy says. "It was devastating what happened, and my text was an instinctual artistic response to the normalization of atrocity."
The video's imagery mixes press photos with iPhone pictures captured by Kim and Heitzeg on trips to the neighborhood where Floyd died. To edit them together, Kim needed to acquire some new skills quickly.
"I got really friendly with Final Cut Pro," she said, smiling. "I learned as I went."
Front-ending the video is a section with Kim's own music. That, too, required technological wizardry.
"I started playing around with a looper pedal and improvising," she said. "I ended up with three or four layers on different loops for the opening music, and I also did a pizzicato improvisation on the beautiful lullaby Steve wrote for the piece at the end."
Putting "How Many Breaths?" together has been cathartic for Kim. An associate professor of violin at Cornell University, she has not played live professionally since March, and has felt the disorientation of the coronavirus period acutely.
"I have a mini-existential crisis daily," she said with a laugh. "What is our role as artists? Am I an effective educator right now? Zoom is wonderful, but so many things are lost."
Maybe, but Kim sees a potential benefit to the isolation. "I think as artists we've been able to step back a little from the crazy that is our normal pace of life -- the next piece, the next rehearsal, the next plane, the next tour, the next performance."
Quarantining, she said, has "allowed artists a space to think more broadly and spiritually about what our role is" -- and to reconnect with one of music's fundamental roles in society: bringing ordinary people together, regardless of creed, color or political allegiance.
"I've done some curbside concerts where I just go out with my parents and my brother and play on the sidewalk. People come with their lunches and we have a great time. They're so happy to have live music that they can, like, touch in the soundwaves."
Creating a similar, interactive space for reflection is central to "How Many Breaths?" To that end, an online discussion hosted by Walker West Academy will follow Sunday's premiere, with the artists present.
For Sarah Bellamy, the aim of this project is clear. She wants it to be more than just another piece of ephemeral protest art, well-meaning but essentially irrelevant to the tougher interactions that drive real change in society.
"I hope it moves people to have the difficult conversations necessary to pass lasting protective legislation, to ensure that the extrajudicial killing of Black and brown people stops," she said. "I hope 'How Many Breaths?' -- and cross-genre collaborations like it -- can support lasting change.
"I want us to be free."

FIRST AVE adds George Floyd star: The nightclub's once-a-decade paint job is otherwise scaled back, a retro marquee added.

Full text: This week's once-per-decade paint job at Minnesota's most famous rock club won't be as thorough as previous ones, but it could still be a makeover for the ages.
First Avenue scaled back the usual overhaul of its star-covered facade in downtown Minneapolis. Its black exterior and all 530 stars won't be repainted like in 2010, due to budget constraints brought on by COVID-19 and the attendant closure since mid-March.
However, in another sign of the tumult of 2020, the club is adding one noteworthy name to its walls: George Floyd.
The man whose death in Minneapolis police officers' custody on May 25 set off protests nationwide will be honored with a special red star, the only one on the facade painted a color other than silver or gold.
The club is also harking back to a bygone era by repainting the marquee above the front entrance to feature the old skyline logo, which was there when Prince filmed "Purple Rain" at First Ave in 1983.
"Obviously our revenue situation leaves a lot to be desired at this point, but we wanted to at least update the marquee," said First Ave general manager Nate Kranz, who believes the skyline logo was last seen there sometime in the 1990s. "We're stoked."
Floyd's star will be prominently displayed at ground level near the side entrance known as "the Conrad door," named after production manager Conrad Sverkerson.
The venue opted to add one more new star: a gold one near the front doors to commemorate its 50th anniversary this year.
The only other gold star on the building is the one with Prince's name on it, painted by an unidentified culprit in the days after the rock legend's death in 2016.
What was supposed to be a celebratory year at the club -- even the Foo Fighters had booked a surprise gig -- has instead found First Ave fighting for its and other venues' future. The club's owner, Dayna Frank, has been serving as the president of the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), lobbying Congress for business grants and tax breaks for entertainment venues closed because of the pandemic.
Repainting the rest of the stars will have to wait, but the good news is they're still shining bright, according to Kory Lidstrom, owner of Indy Painting, who helmed the previous paint job and this one. "They've held up pretty well from a decade ago and should continue to last."
During the 2010 makeover, Lidstrom and the club set off a minor panic among unknowing patrons when the stars disappeared without warning under a coat of primer. That won't be the case this time, but they still expect to attract attention.
"I'm proud to be doing this one," Lidstrom said of the Floyd star.

As nearby crime rises, U conducts review of campus police

Full text: The University of Minnesota has tapped an outside expert to review its campus police department's policies and practices in response to student demands for accountability following George Floyd's death.
Cedric Alexander, a former police chief and member of President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, began the review this month. He will assess campus security practices and how they are perceived by the student body and advise school leaders on how to improve the relationship between students and police.
"The University of Minnesota Police Department, which continues to serve our Twin Cities campus admirably and has built a reputation for responsible public safety, still reflects that there's opportunity for continuous improvement," U President Joan Gabel told the Board of Regents earlier this month.
Students have ramped up their scrutiny of campus cops since Floyd's death, with some calling for them to be disarmed and governed by a citizen panel. The university's police department has 53 sworn officers who carry firearms while on duty, according to a school spokeswoman. Others say the university's police force has a clean track record and does not deserve such scrutiny at a time when crime near campus is rising -- 13 robberies have been reported near campus since mid-August.
Alexander, who lives in Florida, said he will soon visit the Twin Cities campus and meet with students, faculty, community members and officers. He wants to immerse himself in the U community to get a "truthful impression and understanding of what the dynamics are."
A trained clinical psychologist, Alexander said he will dig deep in his conversations with campus groups to see what events caused fractures in the relationship between students and the university's police force. He expects his review will last through the fall semester, after which he will submit to U leaders a report of recommendations on advancing police-community relations.
"Whatever it is that people in the community, in the university community, are experiencing, it didn't just start with George Floyd," Alexander said.
A statement from the U's Department of Public Safety said officers look forward to working with Alexander and finding ways to better serve the campus community.
Students for a Democratic Society at the U released a statement earlier this month criticizing Gabel for entrusting a former police officer to lead the review. They called on U leaders to establish a Campus Community Police Accountability Council made up of students, faculty and community members that would be charged with hiring and firing officers and overseeing the department's budget. The group has also called for U officers to be disarmed.
"I think we've seen the administration really fail to hold UMPD accountable in the past," said Olivia Crull, a recent U graduate and lead organizer with the group.
Over the summer, Crull said university police showed up in riot gear to peaceful student protests held after Floyd's death. She also referenced a 2018 incident in which police were called to a cultural event hosted by the Somali Student Association at Northrop auditorium. The student group said in a statement after its event that university and Minneapolis police officers pushed attendees to the ground, pulled a woman by her hijab and sprayed a chemical irritant at some teenagers.
A university spokeswoman said at the time that officers were responding to a fight between attendees. Campus officers could not stop a fight between approximately "30 to 40 youth" and phoned for backup from other departments, U Police Chief Matt Clark told the Minnesota Daily in 2018. Officers used chemical irritant and "minimal force" to intervene, he added.
Kirby Gibson, president of the U's College Republicans, said he believes the review of campus police is unnecessary since they were not involved in Floyd's death. He said he does not think officers should be disarmed, noting that crime near campus has surged recently.
"I feel like there's a lot of anti-cop sentiments on campus, and with [crime] going on right now, I think it would be completely ridiculous to keep pushing this idea of disarming the UMPD," he said.
Rash of robberies
There have been nearly a dozen robberies -- some at gunpoint -- near campus in recent weeks.
A man used a gun to steal a victim's purse just before 2:45 p.m. Tuesday near S. 5th Street and S. 21st Avenue by the U's West Bank campus.
On Sept. 12, two suspects brandished a gun and took a driver's wallet and 2020 BMW near SE. 14th Avenue and SE. 8th Street.
Clark, the U's police chief, noted that crime near campus generally rises when students return for the fall and spring semesters. However, he said, this particular surge coincides with a citywide increase in robberies, carjackings and other crime. In some cases, suspects are using vehicles they steal to commit robberies across the metro area, he added.
A total of 62 violent crimes were reported in Minneapolis' Second Precinct, which includes the U and surrounding neighborhoods, between Aug. 1 and Sept. 16, according to police data. That tally is the highest in the past five years when looking at that specific span.
"We're seeing that with our campus area and the surrounding neighborhoods," Clark said.
Minneapolis Police Second Precinct Inspector Todd Loining said suspects in these cases generally do not live near the U campus. They come to the area at night looking for easy targets, he said, such as college students who are traveling alone and not watching their surroundings.
Officers are working with Dinkytown businesses and have asked some to distribute crime prevention leaflets to student customers, Loining said. They have also hung anti-theft placards on parked mopeds reminding owners to lock them up.
Due to staffing struggles within the Minneapolis police ranks, there are fewer beat cops walking the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood near the U, Loining said. A community response team that investigates suspicious activity reported by residents likewise has "taken a tremendous hit."
"We're getting into critical staffing mode and we're not sure what's going to happen," he said.
U senior Dave Villarama, who lives in an apartment in Dinkytown, said the recent crime uptick is somewhat worrying, but not "to the point where I'm freaking out about it."
"I think it's very important to keep in perspective that the U is a very big community," Villarama said. "I don't think the crime that's going on is truly impacting the lives of the vast majority of students."

HCMC workers fired for file search: After George Floyd's death, medical records breached.

Full text: In late July, as George Floyd's death still permeated the news cycle, five Hennepin Healthcare employees received hand-delivered letters notifying them they were being fired for looking at a patient's medical file without authorization, a violation of the hospital's confidentiality policy.
The letters, obtained by the Star Tribune through a public records request, do not specifically identify the patient as Floyd. But some of them refer to a "high profile patient" and a case in the news. And shortly after they were delivered, the hospital sent a letter to Floyd's family saying his private data had been breached by several employees who no longer worked there.
The letters give little clarity as to what drove the employees, from departments all over the hospital system, to violate Hennepin Healthcare's confidentiality policy and fundamental ethics to look at the records.
Earlier this month, Floyd's attorneys called the security breach a revictimization of the family.
"When George Floyd was desperate for a breath, the city of Minneapolis pushed on his neck further," reads the statement from the Chicago-based law firm Romanucci & Blandin. "And even after death, he was abused and mistreated by the system. Shameful."
One of the employees, an office specialist in the Emergency Medical Services department, said they were "concerned about the safety of the paramedics that had worked on this patient," according to one of the disciplinary letters, dated July 28.
Another employee, from the hospital's surgery clinic, acknowledged searching for the patient's name but denied reading anything, according to the letter. "When asked why you searched the [sic] for the patients [sic] file you said you didn't know why."
A lab technician specialist said they accessed the patient's records at the request of the medical examiner, who wanted blood samples. But they acknowledged they "did accidentally slip up" days later. "You stated that co-workers were talking about the medical information that was being reported on the news, and you clarified for them what was stated/written in the medical record," according to the disciplinary letter.
The employees were all given the opportunity to appeal the discipline. Hennepin Healthcare officials redacted the names of the employees from the records, as well as the patient's name.
Floyd's legal team is exploring remedies to "make this right and make the family whole for this incredible intrusion of privacy," according to their statement. "The security of medical records and personal information is of critical importance in Minnesota and across the country."
Hennepin Healthcare spokeswoman Christine Hill has declined to answer questions about the data breach, instead citing the organization's policy on patient confidentiality, saying that it regularly conducts privacy audits and that patients must be notified of breaches.
Floyd, 46, died in police custody on May 25 when four Minneapolis police officers detained him on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods convenience store at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in south Minneapolis. Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded for breath and bystanders begged Chauvin and three other officers to stop. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Three other officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All four have been fired.

Full text: Ethan Marks, 19, squinted in the morning sun last week as he recalled the moment a tear-gas canister exploded in his face back in May. He has double vision in his right eye and says he's been told by doctors the blindness in that eye is permanent.
"It was like nothing I ever felt," Marks said. "It burned so hard. I was felt I was going to die."
His friend, Soren Stevenson, 25, wears a patch. His left eye is gone. He has a vivid, gruesome memory of being shot by police with a projectile, also in May.
"I felt my face … and I knew it was my eye all over my face," said Stevenson. "I'm still coming to grips with it."
Both are suffering the consequences of police actions that occurred on different days during the civil unrest that followed the death of George Floyd in police custody on May 25.
Marks said he was helping his mother clean up rubble on E. Lake Street on May 28, the day after several fires and looting broke out, when a police officer fired a tear-gas canister into his face. Stevenson said he was struck by a projectile May 31. He said an officer fired it without warning on a ramp onto Interstate 35W in Minneapolis.
In neither case was there a curfew when they were injured.
Marks filed a federal lawsuit Sept. 8, and Stevenson filed one Monday. The lawsuits each name as defendants the city of Minneapolis, police Chief Medaria Arradondo and unnamed officers.
Asked for comment last week before the filing of Stevenson's suit, John Elder, a Minneapolis police spokesman, said that all uses of force are undergoing "an internal review." He referred other questions to the city attorney's office.
City Attorney Jim Rowader said the office was reviewing the Marks lawsuit. "We are declining to comment at this time on that suit, or on the allegations made by Soren Stevenson."
Robert Bennett, the attorney for Marks and Stevenson, negotiated a $20 million settlement with the city of Minneapolis last year over the 2017 killing of Justine Damond Ruszczyk, who was shot by then-officer Mohamed Noor.
Bennett said the police actions violated his clients' constitutional rights. "Both these men could have easily died," he said. He is seeking $10 million in damages plus attorney fees for each of them.
There have been other suits filed over eye injuries in the wake of the Floyd protests.
They include Graciella Cisneros, 21, who sued the city last week for an injury to her left eye on May 29, when an unknown officer shot her with a projectile, shattering her cheekbone. Linda Tirado, a freelance journalist, sued June 10, alleging she was blinded in her left eye when she was shot May 29 with a projectile.
Bennett introduced Stevenson and Marks to each other, and they have become friends as they cope with their loss of vision, subsequent eye operations, and diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder.
"We're definitely supporting each other," said Marks. "Not a lot of people know what we're going through."
Marks is a sophomore at St. Paul College and lives with his mother, Anne Marks, in St. Paul.
He and his mother, a registered nurse, drove to E. Lake Street near the Target store in midafternoon on May 28 to help clean up, according to his lawsuit.
About 5:40 p.m., Anne Marks went to help someone who required medical attention, according to the lawsuit. Her son walked over to help. He was unarmed and "posed no threat to the officers or anyone at the scene," according to the suit. Without warning, the suit alleges, Marks was struck in the right eye by a tear-gas canister fired by an officer. Bennett said the city attorney's office has told him they know who the officer is but have declined to give him the person's name and have yet to release body camera video to him.
The city attorney's office said, without explanation, that the officer's name is not public data.
Marks remembers the moment after impact. "I was on the ground," he said. "No ambulance, no police were coming. I was bleeding out."
His mother added, "I thought he was going to die. There was a lot of blood coming out of his nose and mouth and ears." She couldn't figure out why they fired at him, she said, because it was not a riot.
"How could somebody shoot him and not help? It didn't make sense. There were police standing around and we were screaming for help."
A bystander drove them to the hospital.
Stevenson, who lives in Minneapolis, is a graduate of the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota with a master's degree in international development.
On May 31, he participated in a protest of Floyd's killing and was standing on an I-35W ramp at W. University Avenue when an unknown officer fired a nonlethal projectile. He said the ramp was closed and no cars were on it.
"There was no announcement to get off the ramp, no statement of unlawful assembly, that we were subject to arrest," said Stevenson. "We were linking arms and chanting."
He said that police fired some sort of flash device to his left, and a second one to his right, and then fired at him.
"I knew my face had been destroyed," he said. "All of a sudden, I felt my eye, and my face and my life were in grave danger."
No officer rendered aid to Stevenson, who was driven by a bystander to a hospital.
The lawsuit cites police policy stating that firing projectiles to certain parts of the body can cause serious injury or death and forbids discharging them for crowd management.
Both men are seeing counselors for PTSD.
"Any loud noise, I just duck down," says Marks, who continues to have pain in the eye. "I have nightmares … I have so much anxiety about police in general."
Stevenson said that when he sees police, he has trouble breathing.
They nonetheless have attended other demonstrations together.
Said Stevenson: "We can't be deterred. People like us are going to continue to be shot and people like George Floyd are going to continue to be murdered."
Said Marks: "It affects our whole community in a negative way."

JPMorgan Chase stresses community

Full text: JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, which opened its first branch in the Twin Cities last year, is increasing its support of community building initiatives in the region.
On Monday, it announced a $4 million grant to help address racial disparities in homeownership in Minneapolis at the same time as it held a ribbon-cutting ceremony of a new community-focused branch that recently opened just south of downtown.
That branch, located at 1100 E. Franklin Av., in the Ventura Village neighborhood, is the second of its kind in JPMorgan Chase's network of more than 4,900 branches. The first branch under this new model opened in Harlem a year ago.
It will provide residents with workshops on financial health and resume writing, a pop-up space that community groups can use for events and to showcase local
businesses, and a community manager who will reach out to local businesses and community members to help connect them to programs and services.
"It's really fitting that we open what we call a community center close to where George Floyd was murdered because we do want to be part of the communities," Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's CEO said via Zoom during Monday's event.
He said that the company is doubling down in areas such as affordable housing, financial education, supporting small businesses and in opening up new branches in underserved areas. He added that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how the Black community always suffers during downturns and recessions.
"When the Civil War ended, there was hope there might be parity with our Black brethren sometime in the next 150 years," he said. "And we're not even close."
The company already had plans for the Ventura Village branch, but then decided to pivot it to the new model this summer, said Thasunda Duckett, CEO of Chase's consumer banking division.
"After the tragic murder of George Floyd and really understanding what we felt the community would need in talking to our teams locally, we felt this would be a great opportunity to make this a community branch," she said in an interview.
Hodan Ahmed, the manager of the new branch, said she has already received several inquiries from small businesses that would like to use its space for events or take advantage of other programs. She added that her staff speaks nine languages and is deeply connected to the neighborhood in many ways.
This is the fourth branch JPMorgan Chase has opened in the Twin Cities since the first near the University of Minnesota last summer. The bank, which has also been expanding into new markets such as Boston and Nashville, plans to open 25 branches in the Twin Cities over the next three years.
On Monday, the company also announced that Minneapolis is the first of seven winners of its AdvancingCities Challenge. The $4 million philanthropic commitment over three years will go toward building and rehabbing 220 multifamily buildings and providing 310 prospective home buyers with landlord training. Its goal is to convert 110 residents into landlords.
The overall aim is to help Black, Latino, immigrant and Indigenous populations build wealth through home equity and rental income.
The winning proposal was a collaboration of five organizations -- the Family Housing Fund, Greater Minnesota Housing Fund, Land Bank Twin Cities, Hope Community, and Minnesota Home Ownership Center. They estimate that the average resident in the program who purchases a two- to four-unit building will see their wealth increase by $300,000 over the next 15 years.
The AdvancingCities Challenge drew more than 150 proposals from 78 communities across the U.S.

SUMMER OF PAIN: MPLS. SPIKE IN CRIME SPREADS, WHILE HITTING POOR HARDEST

Author: Jany, Libor; Webster, Maryjo

https://ezproxy.msu.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/summer-pain/docview/2445671679/se-2?accountid=12598

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Violent crime has surged to record highs across Minneapolis this year, rising in more prosperous neighborhoods that typically experience few such incidents while continuing to exact the heaviest toll in the city's poor, ethnically diverse areas.
Through last week, the city had logged 3,674 violent crimes -- defined as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assaults -- up 17% from the previous five-year average for this period, according to a Star Tribune analysis of police statistics.
City Council members, who have gained national attention for their calls to defund the Minneapolis Police Department, last week shifted focus and pressed Chief Medaria Arradondo to address crime in their wards. He assured them that his department was up to the task of dealing with soaring gun violence, as well as a series of brazen daylight carjackings and robberies in parts of the city.
The police department has experienced a wave of officer departures since George Floyd's killing. Insiders say that department morale has sunk, and that some officers have become more wary of conducting proactive police work out of fear they'll be fired or prosecuted for actions taken on the job. And in an e-mail obtained by WCCO-TV news last week, Third Precinct Inspector Sean McGinty expressed doubts about the existence of a long-term plan to address the area's crime problems.
Dave Hall, who lives near Lowry Avenue on the North Side, said he's become almost desensitized to the sound of gunfire outside his home.
"So it's almost the sense of normalcy, but also scary at the same time," Hall said, recalling that two bullets flew into his home one night this summer.
"I've had to move rooms around in my house, so I'm spending more time in the back," he said.
Emboldened by lack of cops
Records show that violent crime is up 17% in the city's low-income neighborhoods so far this year, and 30% in the city's higher-income neighborhoods. Much of that increase, however, reflects the fact that these areas typically experience far fewer serious crimes.
Linden Hills, for example, recorded 10 violent episodes so far this year, up from the three it has averaged over the previous five years. Lowry Hill logged 12 robberies, up from the five-year annual average of roughly two.
And in June, an shootout between what police believe were rival gangs broke out on a crowded Uptown street, wounding 12 people.
But in terms of raw numbers, the increase in violence that intensified after the unrest over the police killing of George Floyd is exacting a heavier toll on neighborhoods already suffering the effects of trauma, poverty and lack of access to adequate health care. In a city with some of the worst racial disparities in the U.S., those areas tended to have higher concentrations of Black, Latino and other nonwhite residents.
The North Side's Hawthorne neighborhood, for example, has experienced 213 violent crimes so far this year, a 36% increase from the year-to-date annual average of 157 such incidents. Whittier, Jordan and Near North saw equally large increases.
Belal Hijazi, owner of the Full Stop gas station on Lowry Avenue, said that things have gotten worse in recent months. People who used to hang out at other nearby stations that burned down after Floyd's death now congregate outside his station, he said. The violence came to a head when a man was shot and killed while sitting in a car in the alley behind the station.
Some troublemakers seem to be emboldened by the lack of police presence, Hijazi said.
" 'I can sell drugs here, I can shoot here,' they carry guns, they don't care about anything," he said, adding that he got so fed up a few months ago that he hired an off-duty police officer to keep an eye on things.
Not just homicides
Like other U.S. cities, Minneapolis has seen a startling rise in homicides amid the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide unrest over the recent high-profile killings of African-Americans like Floyd.
But other violent crime categories have increased as well.
Citywide, serious assaults, including shootings and stabbings, were up 25% and robberies were up 11% compared to the five-year average. Reported rapes were down 10% -- the only violent crime category showing a decline.
Property crimes were up 11%, fueled by a significant rise in stolen cars in neighborhoods like Marcy-Holmes and Seward. The city recorded 53% more arsons than usual, largely due to post-Floyd riots.
But the nearly doubling of homicides has grabbed the most headlines.
Through Friday, the city had recorded 59 homicides, according to a database maintained by the Star Tribune. The last time Minneapolis had that many killings was in 1998, when the city had about 80,000 fewer residents. The city set its annual homicide record of 97 in 1995, which earned it the grim nickname "Murderapolis" in the New York Times. It counted 83 killings the following year.
Minneapolis is in line with a national trend that has seen slayings increase nearly 15% in the first six months of the year, according to a report released last week by the FBI. At the same time, overall violent crime decreased in three of the nation's four regions, including the Midwest, the report says.
Experts caution against reading too much into year-over-year changes in crime, saying that homicide statistics are particularly subject to huge swings. They also point out that despite the recent increases, crime is still hovering near historical lows. In Minneapolis, for example, crime rates peaked in the mid-1990s, when the city had tens of thousands of fewer residents.
"Here's just one more disparity," said Steve Belton, president of the Urban League Twin Cities. "When there are disproportionate impacts related to health and employment, all of these disparities that have impacted our communities are being exacerbated."
He said some blame lies with city leaders for failing to act while knowing that summer typically bring a rise in violence. "Whereas COVID couldn't be predicted, there is a deep frustration that these cycles of violence were preventable," he said.
Among other findings, the Star Tribune's analysis found that the 16 city neighborhoods with the lowest median household incomes accounted for almost half of the city's violent crime incidents in 2020.
University of Minnesota sociology Prof. Joshua Page said that whatever the cause, rising crime levels can take a psychological and economic toll on residents of the hardest-hit neighborhoods.
"It really affects people psychologically, emotionally, in terms of being hypervigilant, and that hypervigilance has an impact on how children do in school; it can have health effects," Page said. The inverse is also true, he added. "When violence decreases in areas, we also see those conditions I described improving."
In Powderhorn Park, which was ground zero for much of the unrest that followed Floyd's death, there have been 115 violent crime incidents so far this year, up from an average of 77 over the past five years.
But, in the neighboring Corcoran and Bancroft neighborhoods weeks go by without any violent crime.
Searching for solutions
Finding the right response to the surge in violent crime is a divisive political issue. Shortly after Floyd's death, a group of council members announced their intention to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a "transformative" public safety system.
The proposal lost steam in recent months as crime ticked up. A proposed charter amendment that would have eliminated the requirement to maintain a police force failed to get on the November ballot.
Last month, Mayor Jacob Frey provided a broad sketch of his proposal for a 2021 budget that calls for $1.1 billion in spending, including an increase in funding for violence prevention programs. Among the programs, most of which are run out of the city's Office of Violence Prevention, is the city's version of the heralded Ceasefire initiative, which uses so-called "violence interrupters" to defuse street conflicts involving violent offenders and has been credited with cutting shootings and homicides in other cities.
The first team of about 17 "interrupters" started working on the city's South Side earlier this week, with plans to deploy another team in the near future, according to director Sasha Cotton. She said she doesn't find it surprising that poorer neighborhoods in Minneapolis, which have some of the largest racial disparities in the country, would be suffering the most.
Because of the pandemic, some kids in these areas have few places to turn for "respite" if they're facing troubles at home, she said.
"You've got a high rate of desperation, unlike anything that I think you've seen in almost a generation, where people have lost their job because of COVID. And because of the unrest, you've got all of the feelings that the watching of a man being killed on television, over and over again, talking about George Floyd, brings to the surface," said Cotton. "I think even parents in the best of circumstances are feeling exhausted by home schooling and entertaining their children."
And, she added, with the emptying of jails and prisons to avoid coronavirus outbreaks, some offenders are being released into their old neighborhoods without much support. "And so what does that do for retaliatory violence?" she said.

Full text: A stretch of Chicago Avenue that includes the place where George Floyd cried out for his life will soon be named in his honor.
While the street will still be called Chicago Avenue, the city of Minneapolis will refer to the blocks between 37th and 39th streets as George Perry Floyd Jr. Place.
A sign to be installed at the intersection of 38th and Chicago will mark the commemorative designation.
The City Council approved the naming Friday morning, and Mayor Jacob Frey's office said he will likely sign off on it as well.
Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins, who represents the area, thanked her colleagues for working to recognize "this tragic event that has really impacted our entire world."
Floyd was 46 when he died after being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day. The intersection of 38th and Chicago quickly became a gathering place for people who wanted to pay their respects to Floyd and protest police brutality and racism.
While the commemorative naming passed smoothly through City Council, larger questions about what to do with the intersection are still looming over the city.
Months after Floyd's death, the intersection remains barricaded and now holds a memorial. A group of demonstrators has occupied the area, saying they will not leave until the city meets their demands, including funding for anti-racism training and a temporary property tax freeze for people within that zone.
The city had announced plans to reopen 38th Street this summer but backed off, avoiding a confrontation.
The city continues to work on a long-term plan for the intersection.
The decision to name a portion of it in Floyd's honor drew public comments from a small group of people who live in or near the area. Their views varied.
Some enthusiastically supported the decision, saying they felt it was a way for the city to recognize the significance of the events that unfolded there.
Others raised concerns that their mailing addresses might change, but the city assured them they would not.
Some supported the renaming only if it meant reopening the street, saying they felt they were being "held hostage" as crime increases in the area.
Some said they fear police and medics won't quickly respond to their calls if the streets remain closed.

Renewed urgency on police ethics

Full text: No one spoke his name, but George Floyd lingered over the St. Paul police officers' lesson plan.
Floyd's death became a rallying cry across the country for police reform, but also a case study for law enforcement officials in what went wrong. Departments are refreshing duty-to-intervene policies and forcing tough conversations about the real-world consequences of inaction.
In St. Paul, more than 600 officers will complete ethics training this fall about doing what's right even if -- and especially when -- it's difficult. The course identifies a framework for making moral and professional decisions in the line of duty, while examining the external factors that may prevent cops from speaking up:
Fear of repercussions. Alienation from peers. Lack of confidence correcting a superior.
Instructor Chad Weinstein used this example: Say there's one officer on every shift that colleagues don't want responding to a call because they're likely "to make things worse."
"If that's true, you gotta do something," Weinstein told a small group of officers gathered at the department's training center Tuesday afternoon. "We're not doing that cop any favors by not addressing that problem; what we're doing is sowing seeds of catastrophe."
Weinstein, who's tasked with leading 42 iterations of the two-hour class this fall, asked officers to brainstorm examples of a "moment of truth" in which they could act with moral courage. Suggestions ranged from offering constructive criticism to a colleague to taking over a call for a partner who lost their temper, even if no one else noticed.
"We become what we do over time," Weinstein said, imploring officers to consider possible outcomes before making decisions. "This job will eat your humanity if you let it."
The exercise was meant as a precursor to the nationally recognized peer intervention training program Ethical Policing Is Courageous (EPIC). That course, scheduled for October, teaches law enforcement officers how to intervene through role-playing.
Proponents of the EPIC program believe it could have helped save Floyd's life. Now some members of the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training want to roll out the training statewide.
Chief Todd Axtell says he's worked to outline clear expectations for his rank-and-file about the "moral obligation" to step in when a fellow officer's actions are improper -- no matter how long you've been wearing the badge.
"I don't know of any duties more important," said Axtell, who scheduled both continuing education programs before Floyd's death.
In a recent interview, Axtell recounted an experience early in his career when he responded to a call regarding a drunk man on the city's East Side. Upon arrival, he and his partner spotted a man with a backpack, who appeared homeless. His partner spoke with "little respect, if any" toward the man, and the officer started tossing papers from his stuffed wallet during the exchange. Baffled, Axtell says he retrieved the papers and apologized to the man, explaining that his partner must be having a bad day.
"Sometimes all you have left in this world is your dignity," he said. "Looking back now, I feel terrible that I didn't step in sooner and keep that from happening."
Lou Ferraro, a 18-year veteran who acts as a field training officer, said he works to empower younger cops to speak their mind. Sometimes, that's as simple as offering to finish the call for a co-worker who's suffering from "tunnel vision."
Ferraro recalled having to do just that for his partner four years ago when they became too aggravated while escorting a drunk person to detox who hurled vulgarities at the officer.
Offering to finish the call is "not done in a disrespectful way," he said following Tuesday's training. "You just can't take it personally."
Like many agencies, the Minneapolis Police Department mandates a duty to intervene to prevent another officer from engaging in misconduct, but it is not clear how that training occurs.
When officer Derek Chauvin, a department veteran of more than 20 years, planted his knee on the on the neck of George Floyd for more than eight minutes, three less-experienced cops failed to stop him.
All four officers have since been fired and face felony charges.
For Weinstein, the case informs the way in which chain of command can interfere with an officer's duty to intervene. "We have an opportunity to learn from what happened," he said, adding that he alludes to the case without naming Floyd because he doesn't want his public comments to influence ongoing legal proceedings.
Two days after Floyd's death, Axtell was unequivocal with his officers that "something went horribly wrong" at the intersection of 38th and Chicago that night. He asked them to reconsider their career choice if they would have acted the same as those officers involved.
"You have an obligation to intervene regardless of time on the job or regardless of rank," he later told the Star Tribune. "If I, as the chief of police, is on a call and I'm losing my temper, I want a one-day officer to be empowered and trained appropriately enough to tap me on the shoulder and say, 'Chief, I've got this one.'

Full text: The family of George Floyd on Sunday formally announced the launch of a nonprofit foundation during National Homeless Day in Minneapolis -- an event that Floyd regularly attended throughout his life.
The George Floyd Memorial Foundation made its first donation as a nonprofit to the Salvation Army Harbor Light Center, which offers shelter and resources for those experiencing homelessness.
The foundation plans to use community outreach, education and reform initiatives to honor the legacy of Floyd, who died at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.
Its mission is to address systemic racism and police brutality and promote social justice and civil rights, according to the website. The nonprofit was founded by Bridgett Floyd (George Floyd's sister) and other family members.
Sunday's event was hosted by Minnesota Acts Now and the Spiritual Church of God. Scheduled speakers included members of the Floyd family along with the mothers of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark, two other local Black men who were killed during interactions with police.

Floyd family part of unity show: Family members watched some players link arms; others picked different modes of expression.

Full text: Before the Vikings' 2020 season started Sunday, players, coaches and executives locked arms in a show of unity along the goal line during the playing of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," which was followed by a moment of silence to honor George Floyd and victims of systemic racism.
The Gjallarhorn fell silent, a first since the pregame tradition started in 2007, before kickoff against the Packers. Members of Floyd's family stood on the Gjallarhorn's raised perch above the lower bowl of U.S. Bank Stadium during the moment of silence "to call attention to these silenced voices and collectively work toward a better, more just society," a Vikings statement read.
"We're appreciative they're willing to come here and be part of this ceremony, and we know George Floyd has been a really big part of starting a lot of the focus on social justice in our world," said Andrew Miller, the Vikings' chief operating officer. "It's absolute tragic and senseless he was killed, and we want our community to change in a positive manner after such a horrific act."
Packers players and coaches stayed in the locker room during the pregame ceremony and national anthem, performed by Grammy Award-winning ensemble Sounds of Blackness in a prerecorded video.
"The Green Bay Packers respect the national anthem and United States flag and all that they represent, including the right to express ourselves," Packers President and CEO Mark Murphy said in a statement. "We decided as a team to remain in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem and 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' so as to not distract from our message that we stand united for social justice and racial inequality.
"This is part of our continued call on our leaders to engage in meaningful dialogue that results in change. We feel it is important for all of us to participate in these difficult conversations with humility and be open to different perspectives."
During the anthem, a handful of Vikings players knelt, including running back Ameer Abdullah, receivers Tajae Sharpe and Olabisi Johnson, safety Nate Meadors, defensive end Jalyn Holmes and running back Alexander Mattison. Some standing players draped arms on their teammate's shoulder pads in a show of solidarity.
"I knew that some guys were probably going to kneel. That was up to them," coach Mike Zimmer said. "That was their decision. So, it is what it is."
In 2017, during a previous round of protests by NFL players, no Vikings knelt during the anthem; they locked arms along the sideline. This time around, according to linebacker Anthony Barr, locker room talks focused on freedom of expression: "We didn't want to alienate anyone and make anyone do something that made them feel uncomfortable," Barr said.
"A couple years back, kneeling was the worst thing you could do," he added. "Now if you stand, people have something to stay about that. There's always going to be people trying to divide from inside. But it was just, however you feel about it, you should express it your way. As long as we had an open conversation about it, we felt good about whether guys knelt or stand knowing we had those discussions."
Vikings leadership worked with the Floyd family this summer to establish the George Floyd Memorial Scholarship with a $125,000 endowment, and the team's social justice committee discussed last week how to involve the Floyd family in Sunday's ceremony.
Players helped design the team's pregame shirts, reading "Be The Change" on the front and "Say Their Names" on the back with the names of victims of police brutality and systemic injustice.
Players and coaches also wore helmet decals and patches with NFL-approved phrases to bring awareness or the names of victims. Linebacker Eric Kendricks wore the name of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman shot to death by Louisville police officers in March, on the back of his helmet.
The NFL has also added on-field markings in the end zone of every stadium that read "End Racism" and "It Takes All of Us."

Offering kids open doors, and open ears

Full text: It's been six months since Mark Graves had to tell anyone to stop running in the halls.
And he cannot wait to do it again.
"Just to hear the laughing, the excitement, just to see the kids again" is going to be wonderful, said Graves, who runs the Southside Village Boys and Girls Club at the intersection of 39th and Chicago in south Minneapolis.
One block from the corner where George Floyd died under a policeman's knee.
"It has been a really tough haul," said Graves, who watched the toll that half a year of disease, economic downturn and civil unrest took on his neighborhood and neighbors.
But this Monday, for the first time in a long time, the halls of Southside Village will echo with the sound of laughter and running feet.
Five of the 10 clubhouses around the Twin Cities have the space and resources to reopen, with room for about a quarter of the children who usually come for after-school tutoring, mentorship, wellness programs, job training, life-skills classes, games, arts and crafts.
At Southside Village last week, work crews were milling around, cleaning and clearing space for social distancing.
"We have to believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel," Graves said. "As tough as it might be to look around right now, the light is there."
When the pandemic shut the clubhouse doors in March, staff sent the club home to kids. They filled box after box, month after month, with meals for entire families, along with games, educational materials, arts and crafts.
Boys and Girls Clubs around the Twin Cities distributed as much food between April and August as they normally budget for an entire year.
After George Floyd died, Southside Village opened its doors to the entire neighborhood, converting into a free co-op, distributing food, household supplies and other donations to 100 people a day.
We all watched the video, watched the uprising, watched collective grief and trauma bring the community together, watched looting and fear tear the community apart. We've all heard the sirens and helicopters and gunshots in the night.
The kids were watching too.
Graves is still trying to figure out what he's going to say to the children about everything that happened this year. Clubhouses are prioritizing programming for younger children, who are more at risk of falling behind during distance learning at school. But Graves is determined to find space for the teens.
"I'm not sure what I'm going to say yet," Graves said. "I think I'm going to start by listening."
Dozens of teens gathered for socially distanced social justice pop-ups on Minneapolis' North Side and St. Paul's West Side last week. Some rapped, some sang, some performed spoken-word poetry.
"It was amazing," said Abiba Lecky, teen-advocacy liaison for the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Twin Cities. "This has been a really, really difficult summer for them."
The farther this year pushes the teens of the Twin Cities apart, the harder they worked to come together and work on the causes that matter to them.
Some tuned in to virtual Teen Empowerment Town Halls to debate issues like criminal justice reform. Some threw themselves into entrepreneurship and art.
"If opportunity doesn't knock," reads the greeting on the No Lock Doors youth development site, "Build a door."
Some started podcasts. You can find GRL Talk -- "Raw conversations about all things (mental, emotional and spiritual)," on SoundCloud, Spotify and Apple podcast.
Teens from the Little Earth Boys and Girls gather on Facebook for Pride of a People -- freewheeling discussions of everything from Native American issues to music and video games. Little Earth will host its own social justice pop-up on Monday afternoon.
Not many teens trust the rest of us to fix the mess we made.
"Right now, they just want to do it for themselves," Lecky said. "They're done depending on other people, and I get it."
But these are kids, and they ought to be able to depend on us. So Lecky, the Boys and Girls Clubs and nonprofits around the Twin Cities are working to get them the resources and support they need while they process "George Floyd's murder and all the other murders this summer of people who look like them," Lecky said.
A lot of people who don't live in the Twin Cities and don't love the Twin Cities have a lot to say about the Twin Cities these days.
Right now would be a good time to follow Mark Graves' advice and listen instead.

SEEKING JUSTICE, LEAVING A LEGACY

Full text: They fought for change with distinct voices -- delicate and determined, loud and unrelenting. For decades, these Twin Cities civil rights leaders marched and protested, rallied and fought against injustice that people today are still confronting in the same city streets and same government halls. Together, they changed Minnesota. But not as much as any of them would like. "I worry," says civil rights icon Josie Johnson, "that our children have to keep fighting their ancestors' struggle." In the wake of global protests sparked by the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a quintet of long-serving Black leaders and activists -- Johnson, Spike Moss, Sharon Sayles Belton, Mahmoud El-Kati and Nekima Levy Armstrong -- share their histories and hopes. And yes, they are hopeful. They believe the movement's latest chapter might be this country's best chance to right itself, to redeem itself. So long as young people keep pushing. The interviews were edited for clarity and brevity.
JOSIE JOHNSON
Johnson, 89, grew up in Houston where, by 14, she was collecting signatures to fight a poll tax. In Minnesota, she became an influential lobbyist and community organizer who served on the University of Minnesota's Board of Regents.
On the past
When I came here to Minneapolis, there were two residential areas designated for African Americans. One was in the south of the city, where we lived -- near Portland Avenue and 38th, 39th Street. And the other was on the North Side.
I was invited to be engaged in lobbying for fair housing on a state level. During the legislative session of '61, we were lobbying every day -- going to the State Capitol. Many of our legislators had never seen or talked with an African American person. Finally, we were, with the help of Gov. Elmer Andersen, able to get the bill out of committee.
We were the first state to get a fair housing bill passed. That was 1962, and here we are in 2020 still fighting for equal, quality housing. Those things are never isolated. So it's not just housing or just this or just that. It becomes the observation that there's a collective denial of all kinds of things -- quality education, equal employment opportunities. All those things fall into a pattern of behavior. And the pattern comes from the early miseducation of white America about us as a people.
To have a community like ours -- one that many of us believed was open, just, equal, a sign of opportunity -- could be shown to be none of that. America must examine herself before she's destroyed by her inequality, by her own injustice, by her own lack of knowledge.
On the importance of George Floyd
We as a people have always known that the police kill Black people. They report it, but it's always, 'He was trying to get away. …' There was always some effort to explain why our people were murdered.
But this time, with the courage of the people who took pictures, we could show the arrogance of a policeman who felt he could kill this man -- who could look in the face of the camera and be seen doing the killing with no fear.
I will forever be grateful for the courage of the persons who shared with us so we could see with our own eyes how Black people can be killed and the killing justified. If that picture hadn't been taken, America would be treating that killing as it has so many others of our people from slavery forward.
What keeps her up at night
Our children are doing less well, academically. Our communities are less protected. Our people are still struggling for quality of life, for education, for opportunities for our children. Here we are, darling, in 2020, and I have great-grandchildren that I worry about.
It's so important that our children understand who they are -- the beautiful, creative, imaginative people they are.

Moss, 75, has fought police brutality against Black people for decades. Born in Missouri, his family moved to Minnesota, where he helped found The Way, a Minneapolis community center that celebrated Black power.
On the past
My mother had three kids before me. She lost all three. If you went across the train tracks into town, there was a clinic -- but it was whites only. We had 170 miles to get to the nearest hospital that would accept Blacks. So not only my mother, but many of her family lost loved ones bringing birth on kitchen tables. I'm a victim of bad environment. It started there.
The first time I said something, I was 9 years old, and we were uptown on a hot day. I just wanted a drink of water. And my mother told me, "Only white people can drink that water, son." "But I'm hot." I told her, "When I get big, I'm going to drink where I want to drink."
You were disrespected your entire life during Jim Crow, which is the reason my mother brought us to Minnesota. Turns out Minnesota is Mississippi up north.
On building a movement
I was standing up at 16. I was pushing back. I didn't like the way we were treated. Police kept beating young kids up all the time for no reason.
We got The Way out of it. We got that building, remodeled that building and opened a huge walk-in center. That's when we started fighting for our rights. People were coming from the South Side and St. Paul to stand up and fight back. Those were our first battles -- jobs and education. And boy, did they battle us. The movement in Minneapolis came out of The Way itself.
On systemic injustice
I lived it. I witnessed it. I saw the stitches. I saw the court system back up the police officers and everything they did. I fought those cases for 50-some years. From the City Council to the state representatives, none would defend or protect us. None! That, to me, was the most painful part of it -- that nobody would protect our people. You were all by yourself trying to fight injustice.
This is a lawless society. If it's a criminal act done by us? You go to prison and federal penitentiary. But if it's a criminal act done by them? There's no accountability, no consequences for their actions. When you know you don't have to go to jail, then why would you stop?
God let me live long enough where I could prove that everything I fought for was the truth. It cost me a lot, but I told the truth.
On finding hope
The rebellion is about more than George Floyd. It's about how long this has been going on. That's why they're so angry. What they grew up with, what they hear their parents talk about -- it all built up in them. Then Floyd lit a fuse.
All these young people are brilliant. Most of them are geniuses. So if you take the intelligence they've got and pair it with electronics, you can organize.
Now is the time of the greatest chance for African Americans to finally be recognized for their human-being-ness, to finally be treated fairly and to finally challenge systemic racism. They can show the world.
SHARON SAYLES BELTON
Sayles Belton, 69, served as mayor of Minneapolis from 1994 to 2001, the first woman and first African American elected to that post. Today, she's a vice president at Thomson Reuters.
On the past
My grandfather, Bill Sayles, was an auto mechanic who worked at the old Lowry Garage in downtown St. Paul. That's the place where all of the leaders parked their cars. In the course of his work, he got to know a lot of them, and was someone who could make things happen. If someone needed a job or a doctor but couldn't pay, he would help. I sometimes meet men who are senior to me who will thank me for something my grandfather did. I have pictures of him standing in crowds of African Americans fighting for their rights. So, I got it from him, both a sense of community service and how to get things done.
After Rondo, we moved to Minneapolis, and I spent my teen years about six blocks from the intersection of 38th and Chicago. That was my gasoline station. I never really liked the Cup Foods store. When I was growing up, there was a pharmacy there. I know that corner like the back of my hand, every single business that's been there dating back to the Ben Franklin, where I used to go and buy all my sewing supplies.
On a seminal moment
If you look at my high school yearbook, it said that I wanted to be a pediatrician. I love children and love the idea that you could help reduce suffering to the most vulnerable in our society. My focus was biology and science at Macalester until I took an advanced writing course.
We had the opportunity to use our writing skills to help prisoners express themselves. It was an interesting experiment and transformational experience. Going in, what did I know about prisons? Nothing. I had grown up in Rondo before the freeway came through, and it was an idyllic community. We had everything and everyone took care of everyone. All the mothers knew all the kids, then the freeway came.
Anyway, you go into the prison and there's a bunch of Black people, a whole lot, locked up. And you go, "Oh, my god, what happened here?"
You get assigned to work with someone and you start to hear the stories of how people got to where they are, their aspirations for when they get out of prison, and their fear that they'll never get out or make parole. And you begin to see the gaps in services in the community that make it hard for them to get out of prison and have a successful life. There were so many who claimed to have received a high school diploma, and the truth of the matter is they couldn't read or write. Or you found out in their family history that they were subject to abuse and neglect. Or if they were women, they may have been sexually abused by a foster family and no one dealt with their abuse. There was a consequence for that, and it was on the individual, not society. You learn those things and you have to ask yourself, "What can I do about that?"
On finding hope
Right now I'm leading the Minneapolis rebuild effort for Thomson Reuters, working with local and national organizations. I feel honored for the assignment and, of course, it's a part of the city I know well. This is all deeply personal and meaningful for me -- for my family, my values, everything that shaped me.
MAHMOUD EL-KATI
El-Kati, 86, is a lecturer, writer and Macalester College emeritus professor who, as a young professor, was among the founders of the African American studies department at the University of Minnesota.
On the past
America has a split personality. It's the land of the free and also the home of the slave, as W.E.B. DuBois put it. It promises freedom for Europeans but the descendants of Africans are bound to a caste system called slavery.
Black people are the most loyal citizens America has ever had. In official wars, we've fought and died and sacrificed since Crispus Attucks. And all the Black people in Washington's army. There were 200,000 of us in the Civil War. In the War of 1812, Black people were still finishing the White House when the British burned it down. The troops who helped Andrew Jackson win the battle of New Orleans were Black. And on and on through today.
What keeps him up at night
I don't think anybody is born a racist. That's complicated nonsense. And the idea of Black and white races comes out of a racist paradigm. Blood comes in different types but all of it is red. I'm B-positive. None of my children have my blood type but every other white man I could meet may be my blood brother.
What worries me is that we're in a moment that's as dangerous as the moment leading to the Civil War. And the president just adds to it. We're the most armed country in the world. [President Donald] Trump didn't create that but he's exploiting it. Trump is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to be an open-faced white supremacist. Washington, D.C., wasn't segregated after Reconstruction but when Wilson came and his wife came, they were horrified by Black people eating together with whites in the lunchroom, so they set about segregating it.
And Trump is playing with the language and symbols of white supremacy now, coddling neo-Nazis and posting videos of people saying "white power." His vocabulary and paradigms come from that sphere. He's called himself a nationalist but he doesn't have to say anything himself. The old folks used to say that when what you're doing speaks so loud, you don't have to open your mouth.
On finding hope
This thing is bigger than the '60s and makes the Civil Rights Movement look like child's play. First, I'm real proud of the young people. They're exhuming some things from the '60s and coming back stronger. Our movement is not Afrocentric but human-centric. It's not a rights struggle but a moral struggle to have America transcend its contradictions.
NEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG
Armstrong, 44, is an attorney and activist. A former law professor at the University of St. Thomas, she served as president of the Minneapolis NAACP, becoming a key voice calling for police reform.
On the past
In '85 when I was around 8, my family moved to South Central L.A. It was a completely different way of life going from Jackson, Mississippi, where we lived, to a predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood where most people were extremely poor.
Most of my teachers were African American, which made a huge difference in my life, and the trajectory I took. When I was 14, I wound up applying for a program called "A Better Chance," and won a full, four-year scholarship to the Brooks boarding school in North Andover, Massachusetts. It was at that time that I began to find my voice in civil rights because of the racism that we dealt with at a predominantly white school. I started speaking out, researching African American history and honing my leadership skills.
On becoming an activist
Throughout our history, laws have been written and unequally applied to target African Americans. Like the Black Codes, which were put in place after slavery when Black people could be arrested for things like spitting or being unemployed, hanging out late at night.
In 2015, we pushed Minneapolis to eliminate two ordinances for spitting and lurking. We found that African Americans were disproportionately charged under these ordinances and, again, these charges had a lot of consequences.
In November 2014, I went to Ferguson for a week as a legal observer through the National Lawyers Guild. I got there the day after they announced that the grand jury was not going to indict the officer who killed Mike Brown. I went to observe but wound up being tear-gassed. And just saw what was happening on the front lines. When I got back, I was approached by young people saying they were going to start a Black Lives Matter chapter in Minneapolis. I became an adviser. It's now defunct. Nov. 30, 2014, was the first protest. We shut down I-35, then marched to City Hall. The next protest was at the Mall of America and because of my stature as a lawyer and law professor, they targeted me. I was charged with eight misdemeanors. I didn't consider myself an organizer at the time. But I said, if they're gonna treat me as an organizer, I'm gonna become one. And so that really set me on fire to take things to the next level as an advocate.
What keeps her up at night
Activists are underappreciated. We get so used to being mistreated -- to not having our rights or having our bodies be valued. A lot of times you face backlash for standing up for what's right; at the same time, as people become more awakened and/or get closer to the problem, then they may be more likely to get involved or show up at a protest.
On finding hope
This movement for justice for George Floyd became worldwide. That is astounding. We have to give credit to the movement, to the folks here who've labored on the front lines in raising awareness and literally disrupted things in order to bring about change.
I'm hoping the paradigm shift begins to happen and people become hungry for change, not just for a moment, but for this sustained push for racial justice. ï‚«

Freeman out in Floyd case: Judge disqualifies four prosecutors

Full text: Citing "sloppy" work, a judge on Friday banned Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman and three of his staffers from working on the case against the former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's death, but he is reconsidering after Freeman pushed back.
Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill issued the ruling during a nearly 3 ½-hour hearing that covered a wide range of topics.
The ruling related to a meeting some staff lawyers had with the Hennepin County medical examiner, a likely witness in the case, which allegedly violated the rules of professional conduct for attorneys.
"I think it was sloppy not to have someone [else] present [at a meeting with] a primary witness in this case," Cahill said.
Freeman's office released a statement afterward defending its work. It said Cahill granted a request from the county attorney and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is leading the prosecution, to reconsider the ruling. It's unclear when that decision would be made.
According to Freeman's statement, "The meeting was completely routine and if the ruling stands, would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors to obtain, understand and introduce evidence in a case."
Eric Nelson, who represents Derek Chauvin, had filed a motion to disqualify Freeman's entire office from working on the case. He expressed concern that Freeman and three of his attorneys -- Deputy County Attorney Andrew LeFevour, Senior County Attorney Amy Sweasy and Assistant County Attorney Patrick Lofton -- met with Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker in May about the case without a non-attorney present.
That violated state rules for lawyers and turned them into potential witnesses, Nelson argued.
Cahill granted Nelson's motion in part, disqualifying the four from the case. Other staffers from Freeman's office would not be banned, the judge said.
Freeman's office said it followed standards dictated by a Minnesota Supreme Court decision and said the third party at such meetings does not have to be a non-attorney. The statement added that Sweasy and Lofton had asked to leave the case on June 3, meaning they qualified as third parties in the Baker meeting.
Sweasy and Lofton led the state's first murder conviction against a police officer for the on-duty killing of a civilian. They tried former officer Mohamed Noor in 2019 for the 2017 fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Chuck Laszewski, spokesman for the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, declined to specify the reasons for their departure but said a team of county attorneys continues to work on the case.
Friday's hearing held few other surprises.
Cahill ruled on a few motions and reserved decisions on some key issues, including change-of-venue motions filed by each defense attorney; a prosecution request to try all four defendants in one trial; and defense motions to dismiss all of the cases.
Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
His former colleagues -- J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- each are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.
Change of venue
Defense attorneys have proposed moving the trial to Clay County, Dakota County or Stearns County, among other options, arguing that news coverage has tainted the local jury pool.
Thao's attorney, Robert Paule, argued that local jurors might be too concerned about the impact of their verdict given the arsons that occurred after Floyd was killed.
"If I lived in Moorhead I wouldn't worry about the streets of Moorhead being burned" after a trial, Paule said.
Cahill seemed skeptical. "There really isn't a county, would you agree, or a state in this country where there hasn't been a lot of publicity about George Floyd's death," he said.
Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank noted that a local jury was selected for the Noor trial despite widespread pretrial publicity in that case.
Attorneys for the Floyd family later said the requests were an attempt to eliminate Black jurors from the trial.
Joinder motion
Prosecutors want to try all four defendants in one trial scheduled for March 8 to reduce the impact on Floyd's family, witnesses and the court's resources.
Defense attorneys each want separate trials, arguing that their defenses will be antagonistic to each other as they shift blame -- chiefly to Chauvin, a 19-year-veteran.
"There are going to be side attacks [from the other defense attorneys] that I'm going to have to deal with," Paule said.
Alleged criminal past
Cahill pressed three defense teams that wanted to introduce evidence that Floyd was allegedly involved in a 2019 drug case in Minneapolis and a 2007 drug-related robbery in Texas.
Nelson and Plunkett previously filed notices to introduce the evidence; Gray joined the effort Friday.
"What is the possible relevance of that [Texas] case in this case?" Cahill asked.
Plunkett argued that it would show that Floyd's history repeated itself during his May 25 encounter with Minneapolis police. Some of the defense teams also have noted that Floyd ingested fentanyl and other drugs and contend he may have died of an overdose.
Cahill ruled against admitting evidence of either case. However, he warned the prosecution that if it argues at trial that Floyd had not ingested drugs the day he died, then defense attorneys may revisit the request to admit evidence from the 2019 case. (No cases against Floyd were presented to the County Attorney's Office for prosecution.)
An autopsy found that Floyd had fentanyl intoxication and had recently used methamphetamine.
Attorneys for Floyd's family called the defendants' focus on drug use a "character assassination."
"This is what happens every single time," said family attorney Justin Miller. "We get killed and then we get killed again in court."
Floyd family reaction
Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer representing Floyd's family, scoffed at suggestions that Floyd died of an overdose.
"The only overdose was an overdose of police force," he said as hundreds of supporters watched at a protest nearby. "Who are you going to believe? Your eyes, or these killer cops?"
Floyd's relatives also addressed the crowd.
"The nation is standing behind us," said his brother, Philonise Floyd. "And we all need to come together and realize that we need to stop this. This is wrong. We need justice, and we demand that."

Full text: The Vikings announced they will recognize the family of George Floyd and wear custom T-shirts with the names of 200 people who have been killed by acts of racism or police brutality before Sunday's season opener against the Packers.
The shirts will be worn throughout pregame warmups at U.S. Bank Stadium. The 200 names will be on the back of the shirts. The front will read "Be the Change." Players may also wear NFLPA- and player-created warmup T-shirts with the phrase, "An injustice to one is an injustice to all of US."
"I think, first of all, our team and our ownership and our Social Justice Committee have done an unbelievable job," Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer said Friday. "The number of things that we're trying to do to help the communities, help bring people together, and I think that's really what it's all about."
The Vikings also will be part of leaguewide programming that includes:
• End zones marked with the messages, "It takes All of Us" and "End Racism."
• Player and coach can wear helmet decals or hat patches with social justice-related messages or the name of a victim of systemic racism.
• At the conclusion of player warmups, a prerecorded musical performance of "Lift Every Voice and Sing" by James Weldon Johnson will accompany a video showcasing the social justice work of NFL clubs and players.
After the performance of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," the Vikings will recognize the family of George Floyd, who was killed in Minneapolis police custody on Memorial Day. His family will be inside the stadium.
Sunday's national anthem will be a prerecorded rendition by the Twin Cities group Sounds of Blackness.

Face to face: As the murals of George Floyd fade, Minnesotans are working to keep their message in the public eye.

Full text: George Floyd's ubiquitous portrait is burned into our minds. Nearly four months after his death in Minneapolis police custody, the events of May 25 haunt the Twin Cities.
Business owners covered their windows with plywood boards as protests, riots and looting broke out across the Twin Cities. Artists quickly took to the streets, painting over those boards with portraits of Floyd and graffiti-style messages of hope, healing -- and anger, too.
As the protests slowed and business owners started removing boards from their windows, grassroots groups such as University Rebuild and Reuse Minnesota raced to collect them.
Entrepreneur Leesa Kelly, 27, teamed up with the Minnesota African American History Gallery and Museum to create Memorialize the Movement. Kenda Zellner-Smith, 23, launched Save the Boards Minneapolis. After learning about each other through a Star Tribune article, the two partnered up.
Working with Midwest Art Conservation Center on preservation methods, they have collected nearly 200 boards thus far, along with donations from existing grassroots groups. They launched a GoFundMe to raise $50,000, which will fund climate-controlled storage big enough to house boards up to 40 feet long and an annual muraling event beginning next year on the anniversary of Floyd's death.
Some boards still cover the windows of businesses, like a series in Uptown that were recently defaced. Murals painted on the sides of buildings, like the iconic George Floyd mural on the side of Cup Foods, have a more chilling, permanent sensibility.
"Everytime someone is driving through Uptown or down University Avenue, they are going to see those boards and remember what happened -- the injustice brought on George Floyd, the riots, the uprising," said Kelly. "And I think that's what's really important here, to continue that conversation so that his death isn't lost to time.
"I don't want it to be another hashtag that is trending and goes forgotten. It's something we have to continue talking about if we want to see change."

Floyd's family launches nonprofit

Full text: The family of George Floyd has launched a nonprofit foundation and will make the formal announcement Sunday during the annual National Homeless Day event in Minneapolis.
The George Floyd Memorial Foundation, according to a news release, aims to promote social change, bridge the gap between the community and law enforcement, initiate sustainable police reform and reverse racism while fighting for justice.
"We are honored to launch the George Floyd Memorial Foundation at an annual event that our brother was proud to participate in every year," said Floyd's sister, Bridgett Floyd, president of the foundation. "He spent his life giving back to others, and this is the best way to observe his memory and keep his legacy alive."
The event will begin at 5 p.m. Sunday at 1010 Currie Av. in Minneapolis.
The new foundation, based in Charlotte, N.C., is part of a broader response in philanthropy to Floyd's death. In Minnesota, organizations from the Vikings to the University of Minnesota Law School have established scholarships in Floyd's honor while foundations have boosted racial justice funding. In July, more than 20 foundations and philanthropic organizations backed a new coalition aiming to reform philanthropy, denounce racism and raise $25 million for Black-led nonprofits and advocacy groups.
Floyd, 46, regularly attended National Homeless Day events before his May 25 death while in Minneapolis police custody. Sunday's event, hosted by Minnesota Acts Now and the Spiritual Church of God, will feature speakers from the Floyd family along with the mothers of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark, two other local Black men who were killed during interactions with police.
"Mr. Floyd spent his time caring for people. People who didn't have a place to stay, he helped make a way for them," said Bishop Harding Smith of the Spiritual Church of God. "We want to hold this event to not just end homelessness, but also bring attention to systemic racism and other issues that often lead members of our community to these places in their lives."
Several elected officials will speak at the socially distanced outdoor event. The group also plans to serve up to 100 meals.

Floyd's medical records breached: Hennepin Healthcare staff looked at records without OK, family's lawyers say.

Full text: George Floyd's legal team said that employees of Hennepin Healthcare looked at Floyd's private medical records on multiple dates without authorization, which lawyers called a further victimization of a man killed during an encounter with Minneapolis police.
The attorneys say the hospital informed Floyd's family of the data breach via letter, but the hospital would give no further details, including what kind of records were accessed and who accessed them.
The hospital said the workers allegedly involved are "no longer with the organization," but would not say if they left voluntarily or were terminated. The hospital also wouldn't say what positions the employees held.
"When George Floyd was desperate for a breath, the city of Minneapolis pushed on his neck further," reads the statement from the Chicago-based law firm Romanucci & Blandin. "And even after death, he was abused and mistreated by the system. Shameful."
Floyd's death in May at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers touched off protests around the world, raising new scrutiny about police brutality against Black men.
The legal team is exploring all remedies to "make this right and make the family whole for this incredible intrusion of privacy," the statement said. "The security of medical records and personal information is of critical importance in Minnesota and across the country."
The legal team has yet to issue any subpoenas to determine what was accessed. In June, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office released the full results of the autopsy performed on Floyd with his family's permission.
The Star Tribune first asked Hennepin Healthcare's communications office for a comment in July, following questions about a potential data breach. The office declined to comment, citing its policy language on patient confidentiality.
Asked for comment again Wednesday, the office invoked the same policy language. It said Hennepin Healthcare regularly conducts privacy audits, and that patients must be notified of breaches.
Floyd, 46, died in police custody May 25 when four Minneapolis police officers arrested him on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at the Cup Foods convenience store at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in south Minneapolis. Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for several minutes as he pleaded to breathe and bystanders begged Chauvin and three other officers to stop. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. Three other officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. All four have been fired.

First Floyd scholarship started by Wilfs awarded

Author: Krammer, Andrew

Full text: The Vikings announced Tuesday the first steps toward distributing "nearly $1 million" of a $5 million commitment from the Wilf family toward social justice initiatives, including voter education and registration, curriculum on racism and Black history, and law enforcement and criminal justice reform.
Meredith "Mimi" Kol-Balfour, a Minneapolis Southwest graduate, was also named the first recipient of a $5,000 George Floyd Legacy Scholarship, established with a $125,000 endowment by the Vikings in June.
"The scholarship in memory of George Floyd was something that we talked about as a social justice group, as a committee to kind of honor him and help the next person in line," linebacker Anthony Barr said.
The Vikings also announced a goal of "100% of the organization registered to vote in the November election," following in-house educational sessions with team employees, players and coaches. The team says it will help provide personal protective equipment for polling workers throughout Minnesota and has set up voting information for fans on its website.
A partnership with RISE, a national nonprofit co-chaired by Dolphins owner Stephen Ross aimed at eliminating racial discrimination, will lead to "a series of Critical Conversation sessions" with Minnesota high school athletic programs.
The Vikings are expanding a partnership with Everfi's 306 Black History courses to 24 schools, up from 12 schools. The team said it was "increasing investment and involvement" with juvenile detention centers in Hennepin and Ramsey counties, the Jeremiah Program, The Link, Page Education Foundation, and People Serving People. Continued work with All Square, a local nonprofit focused on the lives of former prisoners, will focus on the organization's alumni fund, which can go toward postsecondary education and professional pursuits.
"We've been consistent in supporting our players' right to peacefully bring awareness to issues that are important to them," co-owner Mark Wilf said Monday.
He pointed to the work the team's social justice committee has done over the past three years.
"This is not something that just happened, given the horrible events of the past few months," Wilf said. "This is something we've been working with for many, many years, and we are going to continue to do."
Practice squad additions
The Vikings signed a second kicker, providing more depth at a specialized spot during the coronavirus pandemic.
Kicker Chase McLaughlin and linebacker Hardy Nickerson Jr. re-signed with the Vikings, filling out the 16-man practice squad along with defensive tackle Albert Huggins.
McLaughlin, who went undrafted in 2019 out of Illinois, will be an emergency option behind Vikings kicker Dan Bailey. He most recently was let go by the Colts after a competition with rookie Rodrigo Blankenship. McLaughlin spent a week on the Vikings' practice squad last year.
Nickerson returns after being let go earlier this week after the addition of ex-Badgers and Eden Prairie linebacker Ryan Connelly.
Huggins, undrafted in 2019 out of Clemson, was recently waived by the Lions and joins his fifth NFL team in Minnesota.
Practice squad players can be promoted twice for nonconsecutive game days without having to be signed to the active roster. Those players revert to the practice squad after the game without being exposed on waivers.
NFL teams can also designate up to four practice squad players "protected" from getting signed away to another team's active roster, and can change those designations weekly.

Ex-cops seek separate trials in Floyd case: Prosecutors want joint trial of 4 former Minneapolis officers; defense attorneys say clients could be scapegoated.

Full text: Attorneys representing the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd want their clients tried separately.
The attorneys filed objections Tuesday objecting to an attempt by the prosecution to join all four cases in one trial. They cited several similar reasons for their positions, but their filings also revealed serious concerns that what's best for one defendant may not serve others. And they expressed fears that their clients were being scapegoated for Floyd's death.
Floyd died in police custody May 25 when the former officers arrested him on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a south Minneapolis convenience store. Toxicology reports showed he had a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl in his system, along with other drugs.
So far, a single trial has been scheduled for March 8 in Hennepin County District Court. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill will hear oral arguments Friday on whether the defendants should be tried jointly or together. He also will hear arguments on motions to move the trial out of the metro and motions for dismissals from each defendant.
The attorney for former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, argued that there's a risk the other three defendants could collude to get Chauvin convicted on a specific count that would theoretically allow them to "walk free."
"As is evident from pretrial pleadings, the other three defendants are prepared to place the blame for Mr. Floyd's death squarely on Mr. Chauvin's shoulders," wrote attorney Eric Nelson. " Such a possibility is less likely if Mr. Chauvin were tried separately from the other defendants."
Last month, prosecutors filed a motion seeking to try all four defendants at once, arguing that witnesses and family members "are likely to be traumatized by multiple trials" and that the "interests of justice" necessitate one trial.
Chauvin is charged with one count each of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the May 25 incident.
Former officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are each charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter and second-degree murder.
Nelson argued that they could "work together to imply" that Chauvin is guilty of third-degree murder and not the other charges, which would free them because they are not charged as accomplices in the third-degree count.
"Mr. Chauvin will be required to defend the case differently from the other defendants," Nelson wrote. "While they will need to cast doubt on their knowledge of Mr. Chauvin's alleged intent -- which, as is evident from their pretrial pleadings, they have already begun to do -- Mr. Chauvin will need to dispute that he intended to assault Mr. Floyd."
Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, said flatly that he intended to "shift blame onto Chauvin during trial."
Nelson proposed that Chauvin could be tried separately and the other defendants could be tried together to reduce the burden on the court system and witnesses. But the other defense attorneys advocated for individual trials.
"The defenses are inconsistent and the cases cannot be tried together," argued Earl Gray, who represents Lane.
Gray and Plunkett previously have noted that their clients were rookies with less than a week of experience on the job and that they relied on guidance from Chauvin, a 19-year veteran, during Floyd's arrest.
Chauvin had served as one of Kueng's field training officers and Lane had contact with Chauvin while he was still in training. Kueng and Lane were not in training at the time Floyd was killed, however, and Chauvin had no direct supervisory role over them at the time of Floyd's arrest.
"There are very likely going to be antagonistic defenses presented at the trial," Gray wrote. "It is plausible that all Officers have a different version of what happened and Officers place [sic] blame on one another."
Robert Paule, who represents Thao, has argued in previous filings that his client was focused on controlling angry bystanders and didn't have full view of the three arresting officers as they pinned Floyd down in the street.
Thao should be tried separately because his role was "absolutely distinct" from the others, Paule argued, and because he did not work "in close concert" with them. He said there is no clarity on how similar the evidence will be for each case, and argued that "there is a high likelihood that mutually antagonistic defenses will arise in a joint trial."
Plunkett expressed concerns with an interview Thao gave to investigators.
"Thao made several remarks deflecting the specter of guilt upon the other 3 charged officers, claiming he was just backing them … and operating in good faith that they knew what they were doing," Plunkett wrote. That kind of "finger pointing" led to a new trial in an unrelated case, he said.
Kueng might argue that he did not know Chauvin was going to commit a crime or that his presence or actions would help him do so, Plunkett wrote, stressing that his defense "is clearly antagonistic to Chauvin."
Prosecutors have argued in earlier motions that the evidence in each case is similar, and that one trial would streamline logistics for witnesses, for Floyd's family, for the court and for the community.
"Trying these cases jointly would ensure that the jury understands … all of the evidence and the complete picture of George Floyd's death," they argued. "And it would allow the community and the nation to absorb the verdicts for the four Defendants at once."
Nelson pushed back. Any burdens on witnesses would be limited because much of the evidence was captured on video, he wrote.
Plunkett said no witnesses were particularly vulnerable. And each attorney argued that travel issues for Floyd's family should not be an issue in a criminal trial.

Chauvin appears in court on tax evasion charges: Former Minneapolis cop has also been charged in the death of George Floyd.

Full text: Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin appeared remotely Tuesday in Washington County District Court for his first appearance on tax evasion charges.
Chauvin, 44, appeared before Judge Sheridan Hawley, who set conditions for Chauvin's pretrial release and scheduled his next hearing for 9:30 a.m. Oct. 30.
The former officer is unlikely to be released from the state prison at Oak Park Heights, as he also faces murder and manslaughter charges in the May 25 killing of George Floyd. Bail in that case is $1.25 million.
Three other ex-officers, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, are charged as accomplices. The others have been released on bail pending trial in March.
If Chauvin were to make bail on the murder charge, he would not be required to post monetary bond on the tax evasion charges, but he would have to comply with standard conditions set by Hawley, which include making all future court dates and remaining law-abiding.
Chauvin is the officer who was seen kneeling on Floyd's neck in the street outside Cup Foods in south Minneapolis on May 25, a killing that touched off days of civil unrest in cities around the world.
Two months later, an imprisoned Chauvin and his estranged wife, Kellie Chauvin of Oakdale, were charged with nine felony counts of aiding and abetting false or fraudulent tax returns or failing to file returns.
According to the charges, from 2014 to 2019, the Chauvins underreported $464,433 in joint income and owed a total of $21,853 in taxes. The complaint alleges they owe $37,868, including interest and late-filing and fraud penalties.
Chauvin and the three other former officers are due to appear in court Friday in front of Judge Peter Cahill on the charges related to Floyd's death.

Wild's Dumba claims Clancy: Anti-intolerance crusader earns top honor from NHL.

Author: Johnson, Randy

Full text: Matt Dumba wants to make a difference when it comes to combating racial injustice in hockey, and that's why the Wild defenseman helped establish the Hockey Diversity Alliance. The group composed of current and former NHL players has made its mission to rid the sport of racism and intolerance.
The hockey world is noticing, and Sunday night, Dumba was named winner of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, an award that goes to a player who "best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice."
"This is a very special day for me and my family,'' Dumba said. "I'm just so honored. … This award really isn't about you. It's about the people around you and all the support and love I've gotten from them.''
Dumba's work on social justice came to the forefront in June, after the Memorial Day death of George Floyd that resulted in murder charges against one Minneapolis police officer and aiding and abetting murder charges against three others.
"With all the craziness in the world and what happened to George Floyd, that initiated it,'' Dumba said. "Watching something as disgusting as that, it really can get your blood just boiling. I was at a point where I knew I had to do something.''
Dumba received the award over two other finalists: Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist and Devils defenseman P.K. Subban. Each team nominated a player for the award, and the winner was selected by a committee of senior NHL executives led by Commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy Commissioner Bill Daly.
Dumba receives a $25,000 donation from the National Hockey League Foundation that will go to the Hockey Diversity Alliance and Athletes Committed to Educating Students (ACES). Lundqvist and Subban each will receive a $5,000 donation to charity.
Sunday's announcement marked the second consecutive year a Wild player has won the King Clancy Trophy. Last year, forward Jason Zucker
won the award for his work with the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital and other charities. Zucker was traded to Pittsburgh in February.
It's not only through the Hockey Diversity Alliance in which Dumba is trying to make a difference. On June 18, he launched a fundraiser to support the Lake Street Council and their initiative to Rebuild Lake Street at rebuildminnesota.com. He has pledged to match all donations up to $100,000. Dumba's other efforts during the 2019-20 season included COVID-19 support to more than 60 families who are part of ACES, a Hockey Fights Cancer tribute for a close family friend and a donation to Australian wildfire relief efforts.
Dumba's defining moment came Aug. 1 as the NHL began the qualifying round of the playoffs. Before the opener featuring Chicago and Edmonton in Edmonton, Dumba gave a heartfelt speech about ridding hockey of racism and intolerance.
"Hockey is a great game, but it can be a whole lot greater," he concluded. "And it starts with all of us."
After his speech, Dumba, flanked by the Blackhawks' Malcolm Subban and the Oilers' Darnell Nurse, took a knee during the U.S. national anthem.
Dumba wants to keep the momentum going for his cause, and he used a recent anecdote involving former Wild teammate Chris Stewart to drive home his point.
Stewart has twin sons, Christian, who has lighter skin, and Connor, who is darker-skinned. "Christian asked his dad, 'Does this mean Connor will get shot instead of me if we did something wrong?' " Dumba said. "It's so heavy hearing that from a 6-year-old who's watching the news and growing up in the world. I just took a stand for this generation coming up and them not having to go through what some of us have."

Full text: The Minneapolis City Council's resolve to end the city's Police Department has lost momentum, the result of the failure to get the question before voters in November and council members' diverging ideas on the role of sworn officers in the future.
In the three months since nine council members pledged to end the department following George Floyd's killing, the city has experienced a surge in violent crime, another night of unrest and blowback from residents who felt they had been left out of the initial conversations about change.
Some council members have remained consistent in their statements about policing, while others have softened their rhetoric, saying now that they do envision officers as part of any revamping of public safety.
"I think when you take a statement and then move into policy work, it gets more complicated," said City Council President Lisa Bender. In
the coming weeks, she said, the council will work with city staffers to create a more robust plan for getting feedback from residents on what changes they want to see -- and when.
"We have to make big changes in Minneapolis," she said.
Others wonder if the council already squandered the moment, by taking such a drastic stance that it alienated some who would otherwise support substantial reform.
"They really did miss the opportunity to create actual change," said Michelle Gross, of Communities United Against Police Brutality. "It's almost as if changing the police is a bad word, and you're supposed to be talking instead about getting rid of police."
In the days following Floyd's death, council members fielded a flood of messages from constituents, some demanding they abolish police and others wondering why their 911 calls were going unanswered.
Black Visions, formerly known as the Black Visions Collective, organized social media campaigns asking city officials to cut the department's budget and vow never to increase it again.
Frustrated with the lack of response, they eventually placed mock tombstones in some council members' yards. Some had a picture of Floyd with flowers and angel wings. Others had messages about defunding the MPD.
"The reason behind it was that we saw that Minneapolis was a graveyard, and it was really symbolic of the death of George Floyd," said Oluchi Omeoga, a co-founder of Black Visions. "People have to be accountable to that. Where is your accountability to the reason why George Floyd was murdered?"
City Council Member Alondra Cano was the first to reach out, Omeoga recalled. They talked about the need to do something bold.
Soon afterward, Black Visions and its partner organization, Reclaim the Block, connected with other council members and began discussing what promises they might feel comfortable making.
Privately, some council members wrestled over whether it was appropriate to make a pledge. One day before the event in Powderhorn Park, Black Visions led a protest that stopped outside Mayor Jacob Frey's home. They called for him to come outside, asked whether he would abolish the police department and, when he declined, shouted, "Shame! Shame! Shame!"
There was intense pressure to join the pledge, said Council Member Linea Palmisano, who declined to participate, along with Council Members Lisa Goodman and Kevin Reich. Palmisano decided instead to watch from the crowd. Some people tried to talk her out of attending, saying it would be her "shame moment."
"The pledge meant very specific things, and I was told in no uncertain terms that it was a very literal pledge," Palmisano said.
By the time they took the stage, nine council members had agreed to participate: Bender, Vice President Andrea Jenkins and council members Cano, Phillipe Cunningham, Jeremiah Ellison, Steve Fletcher, Cam Gordon, Andrew Johnson and Jeremy Schroeder.
They took turns reading from a joint statement that asserted the Police Department could not be reformed. "We are here today to begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department and creating [a] new transformative model for cultivating safety in Minneapolis," they said.
They added that they didn't have "all the answers about what a police-free future looks like" but promised to spend a year engaging with "every willing community member."
Without a detailed plan to accompany their pledge, some people turned to statements from individual council members for help interpreting what it meant. Some had promised to dismantle the department, while others focused on boosting funding for violence prevention programs.
When they crafted the pledge, they tried to write a statement that was specific enough to start a conversation, but open-ended enough that people could still bring their own suggestions, Fletcher said.
"It felt important to me to not come forward with a lot of my own specifics. In retrospect, I think I might have gone too far," he said, adding that he hopes to provide a "skeleton" for a plan in the coming weeks.
The pledge was warmly received by the crowd. Almost immediately, though, others in the city began contacting council members to express their alarm.
The next day, Johnson sent an e-mail to his constituents assuring them armed officers will still respond to some calls.
Cunningham, meanwhile, said he would not support merely replacing the existing Police Department with another one.
Three days after the pledge, Bender sent an e-mail to council members suggesting they work on a resolution "to help create some concrete next steps after a couple weeks of various statements from council members to our constituents and the public."
In the following weeks, a smaller group of council members -- Bender, Cano, Ellison, Fletcher and Gordon -- wrote a proposal that would clear the way for ending the Minneapolis Police Department.
It would remove from the City Charter, which serves as its constitution, the requirement to keep a Police Department with a minimum force based on the city's population. Instead, the city could have a community safety department in which police would be optional.
Facing a skeptical Charter Commission hours before a crucial vote, Bender, Jenkins, Cunningham, Ellison and Fletcher sent a letter saying they were "not asking you to put police abolition on the ballot." Current council members, they wrote, "envision a public safety system that includes law enforcement."
The commission wasn't persuaded, and it voted to block the proposal from this year's ballot. While it could appear next year, the decision was a serious blow to the council's police agenda.
With the centerpiece of their plan delayed in government processes, some council members had to rethink their strategy.
In public meetings, some pressed Police Chief Medaria Arradondo and the mayor for specifics on police operations and plans for change.
In mid-August, local media organizations, including the Star Tribune, released poll results that showed the plan to reduce the Police Department lacked majority support. While two-thirds of voters had an unfavorable opinion of the department, more than 60% had a favorable opinion of Arradondo.
In a public meeting days afterward, Cano noted that she feared the chief would be "recruited away." Cunningham said law enforcement "plays a role" in a new public safety system.
The 2021 budget process, which will wrap up late this year, will provide council members with their next major opportunity to push through substantial changes.
In the interim, they are seeking a better plan for soliciting feedback from residents.
There aren't any more public hearings scheduled. There aren't any imminent votes on the framework for changing policing.
Instead, council members are relying on the city's staff to help them create a plan.
"There is such a sense of urgency around trying to start some sort of … community engagement process that is staff-led and better embedded in the [city] enterprise," Bender said in a recent council meeting, "so that it isn't just policymakers having these separate conversations in our wards that aren't recorded or captured anywhere, so that we can help to build confidence in our community that we are moving forward in a way that reflects the complexity of the multiple layers of crisis."

AT A CROSSROADS: AS MINNEAPOLIS TRIES TO REOPEN 38TH AND CHICAGO, OCCUPIERS AND THOSE CARING FOR THE GEORGE FLOYD MEMORIALS WANT ASSURANCE OF CHANGE.

Full text: Three months after demonstrators occupied the south Minneapolis intersection where George Floyd was killed, they say they're not going anywhere until the city meets a long list of demands.
The occupation of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue has posed a conundrum for city officials who are desperate to reopen at least a portion of the street to traffic. They say businesses inside are suffering, gunfire rings out at night and it's difficult for first responders to enter without the help of the neighbors who guard the barricades.
The city had announced plans to reopen 38th Street last month but backed off, avoiding a confrontation. City Council Member Andrea Jenkins, whose ward includes part of the intersection, said the city and the occupants find themselves "at an impasse."
"The intersection needs to be reopened. It's one of the largest transit hubs in the entire city," Jenkins said. "But there is the reality that there is this deep … reckoning that needs to happen in this country. In this entire country. The intersection at 38th and Chicago is the symbol of what is going on throughout America."
Concrete barricades surrounding the intersection prevent cars from driving through. Police officers do not enter the space -- nor are they welcome. Visitors still trickle in during the day to glance at the memorials spread across the street, as if in a museum. At the northern barricade, a message is written on a wooden board: YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE FREE STATE OF GEORGE FLOYD.
The people who occupy the space say they have become the caretakers, maintaining the memorials, hosting community events and handling domestic calls and other issues that occur within the zone. Chanting "no justice, no street," they say the city needs to agree on their calls for this struggling area of south Minneapolis,
for Floyd and other victims of police violence.
"They either give in to our demands of justice or they're going to have to take the street over my dead body," said Marcia Howard, a high school English teacher who has become a constant presence at the intersection. "I owe it to these kids who are now adults to pour into them something that looks like justice."
No timeline to open street
Earlier this summer, Howard and other neighborhood leaders asked business owners and residents in the area what changes they would like to see in their neighborhoods.
Among the demands they came up with: spending $400,000 to create jobs for young people, $300,000 in anti-racism training and freezing property tax increases in the zone for the next two years.
The city says it is already working to increase that investment. The area is one of the new "cultural districts" chosen by the city, which would prioritize funding and seek to prevent displacement of residents.
Other demands are specific criminal justice reforms, such as recalling Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, who first led the prosecution over Floyd's death, and firing four leaders of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Another is to keep the intersection closed until after the officers involved in Floyd's death are tried.
Jenkins described these as "unrealistic demands."
"People have to come to some kind of realization here," she said. "That's like saying, 'Take me to Mars, or I'm not going to move.' I can't take them to Mars."
She and Council Member Alondra Cano, whose ward also includes the area, want to create a commission "to discuss how we address justice, not only for the area surrounding 38th and Chicago, but for our entire city." The commission, which will be introduced this month, would consider career, homeownership and after-school opportunities for people of color. The city will also detail how they plan to preserve the art in the intersection.
As of now, there is no timeline for reopening the street.
Jenkins, Cano and Mayor Jacob Frey recently negotiated over the demands with residents at City Hall, including Howard and Jeanelle Austin, lead caretaker of the Floyd memorial. Frey said they would continue to meet with them, adding that they "are starting to get to a more productive place."
"Many of the demands referenced are beyond the scope of what the city can do alone," the mayor said. "We are entirely committed to investing heavily in matters of racial justice, in that area and throughout the city."
Last Monday, Howard sat on the curb and watched as a group of volunteers assembled two barbecue grills by the western barricade. They would use them to grill pizzas for a community celebration later that night, where they would watch "Black Panther" in honor of actor Chadwick Boseman, who had died the previous week.
Howard, who has taught at Roosevelt High School for 22 years, has not returned this year.
"When I see former students, all it does is emphasize the impact that my calling has had on other human beings," she said. "And if they're in this place holding space, it just makes me feel gratitude that they're willing to join us."
A shuttered gas station was crowded with people as the sun set. Howard and Austin played double Dutch with two long jump ropes while a DJ spun house records next to them. Children drew with chalk on the pavement. People still continued to visit the memorial in the center of the street.
United around justice
"It feels like we've sort of built a community center without the center," said Madi Ramirez-Tentinger, who was also a part of negotiations with the city. "There's no building here but all the events are happening."
These celebrations are spontaneous, Austin said, showing they can all come together "around our belief in justice."
She said she is still waiting to hear back from the city about their demands.
"The city wants the streets open, but at this point they haven't demonstrated that they're willing to actually provide the community with the restitution that it deserves for the injustices and the trauma that it suffered," Austin said.
Jenkins, who visits the intersection regularly, has seen the same scenes of celebration. She has also seen the makeshift shields and barricades and heard the pleas to reopen the street. "I don't like seeing my neighborhood like that," she said.
"There's these conflicting thoughts," she continued. "Because I know that people are suffering there. And my job is to help them, as well."

MAKING ADVANCES, BUT STILL SO FAR TO GO: THERE'S LITTLE RACIAL DIVERSITY AMONG MINNESOTA COLLEGE COACHES AND LEADERS. THE FEW PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THOSE SLOTS WANT TO CHANGE THAT.

Full text: As a Black athletic director in a Minnesota college sports scene dominated by mostly white administrators, Macalester's Donnie Brooks shoulders what he calls a "tremendous responsibility."
Like any AD, he needs to put each team in position to succeed. And Brooks is determined to do that while creating racial diversity opportunities in areas where they rarely exist.
"I don't take it lightly at all," Brooks said.
At a time when calls to end America's racial inequality are the loudest in decades, college sports at all levels are being singled out for lacking Black leadership.
"When George Floyd's death happened, our Black athletes came to me and had concerns," said Carleton's AD Gerald Young, who is Black. "They wanted to see more coaches who looked like them."
College administrators are listening, but all across Minnesota's college sports landscape, there is major work to be done when it comes to hiring more leaders of color. Of the 30 Minnesota colleges and universities that compete in NCAA sports, Macalester is the only school with more than one Black head coach: Abe Woldeslassie in men's basketball and Sarah Graves in volleyball. The Gophers have no Black head coaches.
Only two Minnesota schools have Black athletic directors -- Macalester with Brooks, and Carleton with Young. Macalester and Hamline, both based in St. Paul, have made notable strides with their diversity hiring overall in athletics, but leaders at both schools say they have a long way to go with inclusion.
"My job now is helping to get more folks in," Brooks said. "How do I support more people like me who want to be in this business?"
Brooks was once a Division III football player at Springfield College in Massachusetts. He had eyes on becoming an administrator in the NFL or in Division I. He never imagined working at Macalester or another D-III school because he never saw other Black men or women in those roles.
According to the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, Division III had the lowest racial diversity among athletic directors of any level in the NCAA, at 92.5% white, with only 4.9% African American, in the latest data from the 2018-19 season. Meanwhile, nearly 13% of D-III athletes are Black.
Among Division I head coaches, only 8.7% are Black. That number drops to 5.7% at Division II, and 5% at Division III.
Minnesota has 20 Division III schools, and those institutions have a total of four Black head coaches, including Hamline's Chip Taylor, the only Black college head football coach in the state.
"If we're going to see any change in the composition of coaches, it's going to be about us looking at who we hired to be our athletic directors," said Hamline President Fayneese Miller, whose AD, Jason Verdugo, is also of color.
Among the nine Minnesota Division II schools in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference, there is only one Black head coach -- Krayton Nash in women's tennis at Minnesota Crookston.
Dan McKane, commissioner of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, said he has challenged its schools to hire more female coaches and administrators. His hope is to place the same emphasis now on hiring for racial diversity.
"Once you make it a priority to talk about it in front of ADs and presidents," he said, "you could hopefully see positive trends. … We need to do better."
Inching forward
Diverse hiring is reflected in leadership all over Macalester's campus.
In February, Suzanne Rivera became the school's first Latina and female president. Three Black women have key roles in academics: Vice President of Student Affairs Donna Lee, Dean of Students DeMethra Bradley and Dean of Multicultural Life Marjorie Trueblood.
"I think here at the college, there is some intentionality in our work," Brooks said. "We don't want to become diverse by accident."
Brooks isn't the first Black AD at Macalester. That distinction belongs to legendary sports broadcaster Irv Cross, who led the Scots from 1999-2006. A former NFL star, Cross also was the first Black full-time sports analyst on national television in 1971.
That same year, Macalester made history by hiring Don Hudson from Minneapolis Central High. He became the first African American football coach at a predominantly white college in the modern era, although the school didn't say much to promote the historic move until 2007.
In the early 2000s, Macalester had Cross, but the Scots' head coaches looked like the coaching staffs at most Minnesota colleges right now -- largely white.
Graves, a former Macalester volleyball standout, cherished her experiences as a player, even returning to spend six years as an assistant at her alma mater. Still, she knew something was missing.
"Athletics for many years has been very male, very white and very patriarchal," Graves said.
Following two years as a head volleyball coach at Denison University in Ohio, Graves returned to Macalester in 2017. Soon after, she contributed to bringing more diversity, joining Lee on hiring committees for the AD and president, which led to Brooks and Rivera.
"Once you're actually working in [diverse] environments, you realize how you've been towing the line in being a token in representation," Graves added. "The experience is richer for you personally, your co-workers and your student-athletes."
Hired as Macalester's AD in January 2019, Brooks inherited two Black coaches -- Woldeslassie and Graves -- among the school's 21 sports programs. Brooks looked to create diversity opportunities in other roles, too. This summer, the Scots added two entry-level positions to their department to help groom future administrators of color.
"My job really is for our young people of color and those who identify as minorities to give them fertile land and continue to water the grass," Brooks said.
Taking tough jobs
Woldeslassie, a former Macalester player who grew up a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed in south Minneapolis, is now the only Black men's NCAA college basketball coach in Minnesota.
The Scots went 3-22 the year before he took over the program in 2018, and they've improved to seven and eight wins in his first two seasons.
This summer, Woldeslassie gathered his mostly white team and gave the players a big-picture look at the importance of trying to build a program that could reach its first NCAA tournament. Their success could help show that coaches of color can win.
"I need to make sure this program performs well," Woldeslassie said. "So that other coaches who look like me get a chance."
John Parker had that same feeling 25 years ago, when Minnesota Morris made him the first Black Division II football coach in the state. Morris was riding a 19-game losing streak, longest in the country, but he took the job, having interviewed for 13 others without landing one.
"That's typically the jobs many Black coaches get," said Parker, who went on to earn NSIC Coach of the Year honors in 1997. "You get a job that no one has been successful in."
Parker is surprised in 2020, there still is only one Black college football coach in Minnesota. Taylor took over a tough job at Hamline to win five games his first year in 2016, but he's won just four games since.
For Hamline and Macalester, turning programs around is particularly tough with high tuition costs, strict admission standards and no athletic scholarships permitted in D-III.
Macalester's men's basketball team went a combined 9-31 in MIAC play during Woldeslassie's first two seasons. The volleyball team was 8-20 overall in 2017, the year before Graves took over. Her team went 4-21 last season, and she dealt with players transferring and publicly criticizing her program.
Brooks, though, said he stands by both coaches and that it's up to him to provide the best situations to be successful. For coaches of color, it can be even more stressful considering there might be few opportunities if they don't succeed the first time around.
"We don't, a lot of times as minority coaches, get a second chance," said Woldeslassie, a Division I assistant for nearly a decade.
'Has to be a focus'
The MIAC made history in 1994, hiring Carlyle Carter as the first commissioner of color at an NCAA conference that doesn't include the HBCU's (Historically Black Colleges and Universities).
But convincing individual MIAC schools to take minority hiring seriously in athletics was a "real struggle," Carter said.
Now, decades later, it frustrates him that most Minnesota colleges still are barely represented by head coaches and senior administrators of color.
"There's no real excuse," he said. "If in fact they want minorities in the [candidate] pool, they can reach out … and say we're looking for an athletic administrator, and we'd like to include people of color. That's all they have to do. It has to be a focus of the institution."
Brooks and Young got their first start after being involved in NCAA's Pathway Program aimed at teaching and molding future ADs. And they saw value pursuing careers in Division III instead of moving up (Young worked briefly at Oregon State).
Now they're working to promote opportunities at the D-III level, the largest in the NCAA with 443 schools.
"I've been fortunate enough to be part of programs and been paired up to mentor," Young said. "Getting the foot into the door to get interviews [isn't easy]. And helping to prepare those coaches and administrators for the process is important."
At Hamline, Miller is the only Black president among Minnesota colleges. She hired Verdugo out of the Pathway Program.
Meanwhile, Miller is breaking ground herself as the only Black woman on the NCAA's Board of Governors, the organization's highest governing body.
"We have to put ourselves in that space to affect change in what [college leaders] look like," Miller said. "We are not as many as we need to be."
